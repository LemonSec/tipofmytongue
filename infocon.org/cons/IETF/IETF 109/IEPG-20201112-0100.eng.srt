5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
the mr randy if he would like us to try

11
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,959

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,960
present them if he's surrounded

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
this is good this promises to be a fun

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
presentation it'll be the first time i'm

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,320
seeing the slides so we'll

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
go through it together maybe

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
i don't actually see them but that

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,239
doesn't well if it has your name on it

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
it's the first time you're seeing it

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,839
then that's

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
maybe the best kind yep

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,760
all right well what we can do is we can

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,119
work out the randy slide location

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,920
after we we're at the iepg in bangkok

25

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
um

62
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
because i i presented it elsewhere but

63
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
this this is a slightly different

64
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,640
uh side deck than what i did there so so

65
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
some quick background

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,839
so uh you know i live in ann arbor

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
michigan

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,879
uh i've lived in my current house since

69
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,319
2002

70
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,079
uh and my employer you know at the time

71
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,238
working for uh you know for ntt i had a

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,640
t1 to the local pop in town

73
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,680
uh which in 2002 was still was still

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,679
pretty awesome connectivity at home

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
uh you know around ann arbor there's the

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
usual you know development that happens

77
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
around big cities kind of on the

78
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
outskirts the suburbs and stuff like

79
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
that

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
and you know as as many of us know

81
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,480
broadband

82
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,920
what has was evolving in the late 90s

83
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,920
early 2000s

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
for what technologies were available as

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,518
cable systems went two-way

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,599
we go to vdsl services

87
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,560
and everyone starts talking about fiber

88
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,040
to

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,439
cabinets and stuff nearby you but

90
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,959
nothing actually came out where i live

91
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,359
so so i live about two miles away from

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,879
existing service area you know i live on

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,319
the west side of ann arbor you keep

94
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,319
going further west

95
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,359
you go out next to the farm so that

96
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,599
little pin

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
uh is actually where i am standing

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,320
roughly right now i

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,279
went out and i i used my compass uh

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
and other uh equipment to go and measure

101
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,400
exactly

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,119
where uh where everything is and and you

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
can see

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
you know kind of these green spaces

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,680
around ann arbor and

106
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,440
kind of in the upper left you can see

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,160
the beginnings of the layout of a

108
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
of a new subdivision uh and and as time

109
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,720
goes on

110
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
you start to see you know that

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
subdivision get developed

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,880
you start to see you know other lands

113
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,960
and properties around the area start to

114
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,800
start to pick up and you know slowly

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
you have things fill in you've got a new

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
you know a new grocery store that's out

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,198
in the area

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,479
uh you know and slow you know slowly but

119
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,720
surely

120
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
things uh things fill in we get a new

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,199
home improvement store

122
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
and there's a little uh there's a new

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,280
subdivision that you know

124
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
it you know was going in there uh you

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,239
know kind of behind the new home

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
improvement store etc

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,440
uh just going back through the uh the

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,400
imagery

129
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
and stuff so i've i i have this problem

130
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
i work in

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,280
the internet industry and i have no

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,680
high-speed internet available

133
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
uh in the us if you're not familiar

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,880
generally when you sell a home

135
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
the seller pays a commission based on

136
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,800
you know how much you sell the home for

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,639
and that can represent a significant

138
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,160
cost to move your house

139
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,680
and effectively my home is devalued

140
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
uh in the marketplace talking to

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,440
realtors because there's no high-speed

142
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,479
internet accessible so what do i do

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,840
uh i go and i work with local isp a

144
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
little wireless isp

145
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,000
and they came to the rescue you know for

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
for about 10 years or so so

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,520
what do you do how do you solve this

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
type of problem conflict etc

149
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,880
so i actually went and i started a telco

150
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
i am now the big bad evil telco around

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,800
me so you have to

152
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,000
uh in my case i had to file a tariff uh

153
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
and hopefully one day

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
you know i'll turn massive profits as a

155
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,400
result of this

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,919
so you have to go out require customers

157
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,679
you have to acquire internet access

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,359
you have to do construction hire

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,440
contractors obtain

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
fiber and all of these these things that

161
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
you need to do once you're a telephone

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,360
company

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,880
so you have tons of research planning

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
you have to actually piece together you

165
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,600
know all the finances and stuff

166
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,520
so what i did was i started to actually

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
doing pre-built

168
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,799
because i worked with the local wireless

169
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,280
isp i

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,360
started connecting all of my neighbors

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,119
uh to fiber to my house

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
because the local five gigahertz

173
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,599
spectrum you know as everyone is

174
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,360
upgrading their technologies at home uh

175
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,639
that started to cause congestion on the

176
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,160
local uh you know on the local wireless

177
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
that was providing access to them

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,599
as you're doing research you find your

179
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,520
access costs eventually at att actually

180
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,919
rolled into the dsl in my area

181
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,198
and for forty dollars a month i can get

182
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,479
speeds up to

183
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,680
1.5 megabits per second uh

184
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,080
i tried to reach out to comcast as well

185
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,080
uh amongst other providers that are

186
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,000
available and comcast was actually

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
remarkably the easiest service provider

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
to work with att

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
you couldn't get a hold of anybody there

190
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,120
uh to have them understand

191
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,400
what the connectivity was uh you know

192
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,080
that there is fiber

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,719
1200 feet from my house that att owns

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
uh and actually as far as i know is

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
actually connected to a cell tower that

196
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,159
has no antennas on it

197
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,520
so is would be completely available to

198
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
be used

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,878
uh comcast was reasonable they could

200
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,400
actually give me a price and say

201
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
it's hey it's going to be fifty thousand

202
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
dollars and i started working talking to

203
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
my neighbors and saying

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
hey for fifty thousand dollars uh i'm

205
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,759
willing to pay

206
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,318
you know some portion of this you know i

207
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,160
might have

208
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,919
i was willing to probably pay ten

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
thousand dollars uh to

210
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,758
extend to paid comcast ten thousand

211
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
dollars to extend the fiber to my

212
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
neighborhood

213
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,960
but i was not gonna eat the entire fifty

214
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,400
thousand dollar cost

215
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,159
because that's that's a significant

216
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
expense for me to pay somebody to extend

217
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
their network so they can have all the

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,719
customers

219
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,559
so i play start playing around with

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
technology i play around with active

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
ethernet solutions

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,479
i actually ended up buying an olt

223
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,160
for doing gpon and i started engaging

224
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,159
marketing activities i

225
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
you know joined all the local facebook

226
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
groups uh

227
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,718
and talked to all my neighbors and i

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,599
also mailed letters

229
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
to all the potential subscribers i i

230
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,159
talked to

231
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,000
a bunch of different isps in michigan

232
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,679
who are already doing fiber to the home

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
who either were engaged in active

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,359
ethernet

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,680
and stuff as well as engage with

236
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,839
community groups there was a

237
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,439
not-for-profit that was set up called

238
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,320
the michigan broadband cooperative i

239
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
talked to

240
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
all the people as part of that and they

241
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,399
were really looking for big grants

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,680
uh to go and do do things and there's a

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,240
couple other small

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,479
local isp cooperatives that are set up

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,760
to basically provide wireless services

246
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,360
and as part of the efforts of that uh uh

247
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,080
you know the michigan broadband co-op

248
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,920
one of the one of the local townships uh

249
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
nearby me actually passed a millage and

250
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,439
they

251
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,320
they uh raised taxes to

252
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,600
fund uh all underground fiber

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
infrastructure for

254
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
uh the you know all the residents in the

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,320
uh the environment uh

256
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,399
in the entire township

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,519
so what do you do you got to put your

258
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
money where your mouth is

259
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,160
i purchased a fusion splicer i started

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,040
buying you know that fiber in 2017

261
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,480
i ended up buying an otdr in 2018 you

262
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,760
know because

263
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
these things were starting to come down

264
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
and be affordable enough that

265
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
you could actually spend some money on

266
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
them get the technology

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
have it be available for you uh and and

268
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,360
do that

269
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
i also then started going in working

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,560
with people to get

271
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,319
design prints all you know all done i

272
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,800
had that tariff that i had to file i

273
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
joined

274
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
you know in in michigan it's called the

275
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,720
mystic system or in most of the us it's

276
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,599
known as the 8-1-1 system or dick safe

277
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,839
or something

278
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
uh and i actually went turned in all the

279
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,519
you know these giant prints

280
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,839
uh as well as my permit in april of 2019

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,959
and eventually after a long time i ended

282
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
up getting

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,599
the permit issue to me in 2019

284
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,560
and stuff because of that and the time

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
of year because

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,599
i live in an environment where we

287
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,519
actually get snow in the middle of the

288
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,079
winter

289
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,000
that basically pushed my uh schedule

290
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,439
into 2020.

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,920
so how was i successful at doing this

292
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
well

293
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
i started off spending you know small

294
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,760
amounts of money i found all the

295
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,040
distributors

296
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,560
uh you know i went and i i pre-purchased

297
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
uh a fair amount of the equipment just

298
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
such that i wasn't taking a giant

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,599
financial hit

300
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,000
all at once my initial planning kind of

301
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,440
i

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
came back and had estimates of this is

303
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,839
going to be a sixty thousand dollar

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,880
project

305
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,959
uh it you know i had to go and save all

306
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,760
my pennies you know from bonuses

307
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,959
uh you know uh and i actually copied the

308
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,519
model from

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
uh another isp here in michigan called

310
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
virgins fiber

311
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
or vb fiber where a customer can pay

312
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,160
five thousand dollars up front and

313
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
receive a 50

314
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,000
service credit for 100 months and that's

315
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
that's nice because you can say oh well

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
how about you give me a thousand dollars

317
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,680
i give you ten dollars off for 100

318
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
months

319
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,959
stays with the property and really

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,120
really helped me offset some of those

321
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,359
initial uh startup costs

322
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,399
uh as well as the the thing that i think

323
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,480
is most important is

324
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
the customer is still paying something

325
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
they don't just then get

326
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
free service for a period of time uh

327
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,839
and and that really kind of makes sure

328
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
that you're maintaining that customer

329
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
relationship and make sure that

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
you know the the service is working so i

331
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
actually sat down

332
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
and i did a full plan of what the

333
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,480
monthly operating expenses are

334
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,800
how much it would cost me to to you know

335
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,519
for

336
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,399
internet access along the way uh look at

337
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,160
every single month

338
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,079
how much it's gonna cost me you know for

339
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,199
repairs uh

340
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,638
for insurance all all the materials and

341
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,639
everything that i need to do

342
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,079
uh and then also went modeled how many

343
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,079
customers i would have and i

344
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,439
slowly revised this number up for the

345
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,199
number of customers as i

346
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
continue to get more people to commit to

347
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,680
sign up uh

348
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,920
you know for the service plan so i could

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,199
figure out okay

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
how's this going to work out am i going

351
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,480
to actually be able to turn

352
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,160
a profit with this how much is my

353
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,920
monthly operating profit going to be et

354
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,519
cetera et cetera

355
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,279
and and this is the spreadsheet that i

356
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,720
used including you know

357
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,200
putting some formulas in there to say

358
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
okay if i stop growing how many months

359
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,399
until i pay off that

360
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,839
initial investment you see that there in

361
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,839
the bottom in row 38

362
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,599
so yeah i spend a lot of time with this

363
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
spreadsheet

364
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
really trying to understand what my

365
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,880
costs are uh you know

366
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,800
what what all those things were and

367
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,399
really forecast you know

368
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,839
uh and talk to a number of different

369
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,240
service providers about how to handle

370
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,680
things like disputes refunds bad debts

371
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,399
uh as well as you know whether or not

372
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,160
you want to fire customers um i i talked

373
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,880
about this a little bit already

374
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,399
um you know i i actually worked with you

375
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,279
know in the west i actually pre-wired

376
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,399
everybody at my

377
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,920
my own expense as opposed to uh

378
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,160
asking him to do that i basically said

379
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,959
listen i'm gonna do this and after all

380
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,760
of that

381
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,399
uh once i get a high-speed connection to

382
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
my house

383
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,600
all these people become my customer uh

384
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
and

385
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
that actually worked well for the

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,680
wireless isp as well so

387
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,079
what does an install look like this is

388
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,680
the

389
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,839
boxes actually put on the outside of the

390
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,399
home uh here in the center and on the

391
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
left

392
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,000
and on the right is actually where i

393
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
have a the 24 i have a 24 count

394
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,279
fiber cable that comes into my basement

395
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,479
uh and you can see

396
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,279
you can see all the uh the wipes from

397
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
doing the

398
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,360
splices for that that apparently were on

399
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,720
the floor for that photo again

400
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,000
there typical customer installation

401
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,279
uh i'm using the ubiquiti uh u-fiber

402
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,199
instant sfp

403
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,519
i put that in the microtech media

404
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
converter uh i've got this box that i

405
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,000
use

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,800
for uh terminating the you know the uh

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,160
the splice in you've got an armored

408
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
patch cord that goes between the two

409
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,560
boxes

410
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,079
and you run power ethernet from the

411
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,439
inside to the outside of the house

412
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,800
and this is nice because i can show up

413
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,680
at the person's home i can test the

414
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,680
service

415
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:28,000
and uh without them needing to be there

416
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,040
uh and do troubleshooting and other work

417
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,639
because that

418
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,160
you know i'm a telco i don't want to

419
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
have to do stuff on the customer's

420
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,760
schedule

421
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,479
uh i also have these microtech the hack

422
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,319
ac2

423
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
and there's now the half ac3 routers

424
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,480
which i'll probably start toying around

425
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,079
with

426
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,120
i actually just sell these to people at

427
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,399
cost if they say oh i need a wireless

428
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
router

429
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,480
or something like that so what does it

430
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,800
look like you go

431
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,639
you see all these construction supplies

432
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
uh that you get from your distributors

433
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,399
i'll tell you nothing is funnier than

434
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
showing up in a prius to pick up a bunch

435
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,000
of these materials

436
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,040
uh you know from the uh you know from

437
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
the place you start

438
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
digging and drilling you know under

439
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,240
driveways and

440
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,279
uh you know burying burying all these

441
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,199
things uh

442
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,320
lots and lots and lots of fun for the

443
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,439
customer acquisition

444
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,320
i used this uh this tool

445
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,279
that my county has available uh called

446
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,440
map washington

447
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
i'm in washington county in michigan you

448
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,920
can look at all the property shapes get

449
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,079
the owner names

450
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,000
and how i signed everybody up i sent

451
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,279
them a letter

452
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,360
on paper in the in the mail uh

453
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,959
that actually worked remarkably well i

454
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,120
actually just yesterday

455
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,518
hooked up one of the people uh who was

456
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,519
who when he received the letter uh he

457
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,160
said is this a scam he called me on the

458
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,720
phone and said

459
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,160
is this a scam uh it was very funny

460
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
conversation i'm like

461
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,560
yes i'm gonna tell you it's a scam over

462
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
the phone that i'm trying to scam

463
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,399
you to get internet access uh he was

464
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
very happy

465
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,320
once he got hooked up the very next day

466
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,719
he started pulling 50 megs continuous

467
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,160
uh because i try to keep an eye on

468
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
people when they when they get first

469
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,839
hooked up and make sure it works

470
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,439
smoothly

471
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,880
and you can tell because he was using

472
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,480
dsl and

473
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,600
satellite as backup for that you know

474
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,480
here in what is seemingly a very urban

475
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
area

476
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
or you know somewhat urban somewhat

477
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,560
urban area

478
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
very nearby plus the thing the thing

479
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
about his house that's interesting is

480
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,759
there's actually fiber in front of his

481
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,680
house on poles

482
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
which is just one of those things that

483
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,239
you know boggles your mind is that

484
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,040
i i have in one spot right next to a

485
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
farm field

486
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
there is my fiber that crosses two other

487
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,600
people's fiber

488
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
out out in the middle uh in this farm

489
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,440
field

490
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,639
because it goes to a cell tower

491
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,000
so you mail out these letters i got

492
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,480
invited to one of the neighborhood

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,160
association meetings uh once

494
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,680
construction started i sent out more

495
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,959
letters more people signed up

496
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,599
and ultimately about 70 of the homes

497
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,079
uh signed up that i passed uh i was

498
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,079
projecting it was going to be about 35

499
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
uh is how i did my initial financial

500
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,159
model to to see

501
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
you know what it would take to do this

502
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,079
so

503
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,600
internet access uh i i

504
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,879
i originally went and uh talked to

505
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,639
you know a number of different companies

506
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
one of them is one two three net

507
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,319
uh because of all the excitement of

508
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,160
covid this year

509
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,079
they actually were delayed and getting

510
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,679
these services and acdnet

511
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,200
who i had talked to as well they called

512
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,520
me back uh

513
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
in in the beginning of march and so i

514
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,918
had started construction and i didn't

515
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,679
yet

516
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
actually have my internet access fully

517
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
lined up

518
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,559
and ac and acd was able to actually

519
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
give me fiber access exactly where i

520
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
wanted uh

521
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,400
which is you know very important they

522
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
are still i'm still waiting i was told

523
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,440
within the next two weeks i'm actually

524
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,399
going to get v6 from them

525
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
uh they uh they have to go through and

526
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
actually enable it on their network

527
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,000
because they don't actually have it

528
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,880
it have it and uh that's that's

529
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
something important

530
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,600
but you know with aaron you can apply

531
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
for ipv6 space for your service provider

532
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,120
once you have v6 space you can actually

533
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,840
apply for ipv4 space so

534
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,520
despite the fact that there's a run out

535
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,639
of address space

536
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
uh you know i think everybody uh is well

537
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,160
aware of that

538
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
um you know it is still possible to

539
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
start on

540
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,879
a brand new isp here in uh 2020 2021

541
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
time frame

542
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,520
i already have a spare asm lying around

543
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,120
uh and so i'm able to actually bgp

544
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,000
here with uh acdnet and once i get

545
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,280
connected to 123 i'm also getting a

546
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,679
connection to the detroit ix

547
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,600
so this is what the project picture

548
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,080
ultimately looks like once you uh

549
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,678
once you turn into plans uh spent lots

550
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,039
of time doing that and you can see

551
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,200
some of the shapes started to get filled

552
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,480
in further to the west there

553
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,600
as more people signed up along the way

554
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,039
um i had to hire contractors i had to

555
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
maintain a good working relationship

556
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,400
with them i uh

557
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,678
i would you know one day a week i would

558
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,280
actually buy them food to keep them

559
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
happy and working otherwise there were

560
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
these three brothers

561
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,720
and you know one of them or the other

562
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,520
one would get like hangry with the

563
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,679
others

564
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,200
uh and i had lots of little issues i had

565
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,760
to resolve along the way

566
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,360
uh you know and uh you know if you're

567
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,320
gonna hire a contractor to do a big

568
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,918
project like this

569
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
you really need to have policies around

570
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,320
things like social media posts and stuff

571
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,918
like that

572
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,439
uh you know and make sure they have all

573
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
the right equipment i ended up helping

574
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
them out in a few cases because

575
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,720
i'm a little bit more mechanically

576
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,360
inclined than some of them

577
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
in uh troubleshooting you know uh things

578
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,159
with

579
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
you know batteries and engines and stuff

580
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,080
like that um

581
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,639
so so here we are here they are out

582
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
working uh there is an 18-inch natural

583
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
gas pipeline actually at the end of my

584
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,080
road

585
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,960
uh that runs kind of at an angle behind

586
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
my property

587
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,039
and so this is them using uh basically a

588
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,158
a giant shop vac and then you use a

589
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,240
pressure washer

590
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
type thing to actually spray the dirt

591
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,240
and then you suck it up uh

592
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
you know with basically this industrial

593
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
shop vac to

594
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,280
to get so you can actually find the

595
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,479
utilities underground so you don't

596
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,559
board through an 18-inch pipeline and

597
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,000
cause a big mess so

598
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,840
you're doing a big project like this

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,559
you're absolutely going to have problems

600
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,399
i call this the cursed corner uh because

601
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,480
every time you would phone in to 8-1-1

602
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,880
and say hey i need you to mark this

603
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,960
they never marked it twice the same way

604
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,720
uh they would they would mark the fiber

605
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
as the gas they marked the gas as the

606
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,280
fiber

607
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,120
uh and it actually took my contractor

608
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
three times to bore successfully through

609
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,918
that intersection

610
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,600
and and i did this little drawing which

611
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,720
isn't quite accurate but this

612
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,240
you know the green lines are are mine

613
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,000
the orange is the fiber that goes

614
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,840
through the intersection and the yellow

615
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,799
is the natural gas pipeline that

616
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,399
uh that goes right there in a very very

617
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,440
weird order and there's a

618
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,600
there's a like a a 10 foot

619
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,679
sized culvert right there that goes

620
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,240
diagonally to let the water flow through

621
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,880
uh and so my conduit is just right

622
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,480
underneath

623
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,480
uh right underneath that

624
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,760
so i bought some equipment i actually

625
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,240
bought

626
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,039
you know this vintage uh directional

627
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,919
drill

628
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,039
uh i have a borrowed uh cable plow it's

629
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,200
basically uh

630
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,280
you know used for burying service drop

631
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,840
cables it's got a vibrating

632
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,200
uh blade and it is actually owned by the

633
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,480
wireless isp

634
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,000
uh that i previously used um

635
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,679
here's some photos of the equipment and

636
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,120
you can see you know the

637
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,280
the machine for bearing the cable it's

638
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,959
got a chute there and so you just drive

639
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,240
along in the ground it vibrates and it

640
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
just buries the cable

641
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
as it goes it's uh you know it works

642
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,720
remarkably well

643
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,240
but sometimes when you have equipment

644
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,440
bad things happen

645
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,760
uh so the cable plow actually was stolen

646
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,799
uh it ended up for sale on in facebook

647
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,240
marketplace

648
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
uh i uh i blurred out the guy's name who

649
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,520
was selling it and

650
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,039
other stuff but it turned up uh you know

651
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
i'm in another michigan it turned up in

652
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,400
chicago

653
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,120
uh for sale uh as you can see in aurora

654
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
illinois

655
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,239
uh and then this photo that i have here

656
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
on the left

657
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,039
it shows in the spring when i was

658
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,840
pulling some of the conduit out of my

659
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,000
yard

660
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,000
uh you know the ground was a little too

661
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,799
soft but this photo ended up being

662
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
really helpful

663
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,000
in us actually recovering the machine

664
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,000
because

665
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,520
this was actually the best photo of that

666
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,960
specific machine

667
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,080
uh including uh you know

668
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,840
very specific wear marks on it that

669
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,760
allowed the police to go and recover it

670
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,600
from uh the person's uh home

671
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,799
i also received a stop work order in the

672
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,280
middle of it it's

673
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
uh it's kind of interesting because like

674
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,158
all things i actually got to stop work

675
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
for the reason other

676
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
uh they say no stick right of way um you

677
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,280
know the road commission

678
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
people they want me to have uh the right

679
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,080
of ways

680
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,440
we did have it staked but we didn't have

681
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,240
it staked

682
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,480
at sufficient intervals for them uh to

683
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,600
make the guy happy and so so he came out

684
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,960
and uh and stopped that also

685
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,158
we notified them when we were starting

686
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
the project but they wanted to be

687
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,520
notified every 48 hours

688
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,280
prior to a work crew being on site

689
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,879
uh that was going to work on the project

690
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,200
so they could do drive-by inspections

691
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
so that was part of my unbudgeted cost

692
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
you know when you're doing a big project

693
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
you've got that so that was another five

694
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,919
thousand dollars for that i had to go

695
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,320
and put wire in the conduit

696
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,480
uh to get them to say was okay for us to

697
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
resume they want to know how deep it was

698
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
and all that stuff um i had to spend

699
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,199
1500 bucks

700
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,918
on a water meter hydrant like a hydrant

701
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
hookup

702
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,840
uh to go and make it such that they

703
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,080
could uh you know do all the

704
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,039
the boring with the with nice clean

705
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,199
water i

706
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,320
and i also printed up employee badges uh

707
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,480
for myself and

708
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,080
my kids and stuff for that the other

709
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,840
thing that happens is

710
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,199
you know everyone makes jokes about

711
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,639
people

712
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,320
hitting the fiber that it's you know

713
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
that it's buried or whatever

714
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,360
uh quite often these things are not

715
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,360
marked well

716
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,399
uh or they just they maybe mark the main

717
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
line but they don't actually

718
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,679
mark the service drop that goes up to

719
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
somebody's house uh and so

720
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,720
and and they're often not even buried

721
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
deep you can see here

722
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
this one was about four inches deep

723
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,480
below the uh

724
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,240
uh below that as well as uh you know i

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
have this conduit that got hit which was

726
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,440
actually

727
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
part of my own part of the conduit that

728
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,720
my contractor actually installed

729
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,039
as well they got it wrapped around stuff

730
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,880
so

731
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,679
sometimes you even hit your own stuff

732
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,279
even as you're installing it

733
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,919
so if you don't know to install fiber

734
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,760
you

735
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,600
generally blow it in with a giant

736
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,200
industrial air compressor

737
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,678
i'll tell you something this this reel

738
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,880
of fiber here on the left it was 20 000

739
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,200
feet of fiber so just uh you know

740
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,840
i would say about four miles or so that

741
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,000
all got pulled off by hand

742
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,158
off that reel and so you know when you

743
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,480
realize that you've done

744
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,480
uh

745
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,959
uh you know that you've pulled off four

746
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,039
miles of fiber by hand

747
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,559
uh that can be quite rewarding you get

748
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,799
to hear the sound apparently people in

749
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,480
my house are printing

750
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,480
as well so sorry about that

751
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
uh so as part of this i actually built

752
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,400
my own fiber blower out of

753
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,080
parts available at your local hardware

754
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,520
store for the most part except for this

755
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,760
chicago

756
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,879
fitting that goes on the uh industrial

757
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,720
air compressor hose

758
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,919
i actually blew 2700 feet

759
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,360
you know without issue uh it took me a

760
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,960
long time to get this working

761
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,559
just right you know we spent a lot of

762
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
time trying to put put stuff in the

763
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,760
conduit it didn't quite work right and i

764
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
would go and consult with

765
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,799
the various experts uh at the other isps

766
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,679
about

767
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,400
hey how do you do this uh how does this

768
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,840
work out

769
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,840
and uh you know it's it took a

770
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,760
it's about a 15 you know i'll say 15 000

771
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,279
foot project that we did

772
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
and uh the you know it took a whole

773
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,640
bunch of days to

774
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,120
of renting that machine to get you know

775
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,000
the first uh 7 500 feet in

776
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,840
we got the last 7 500 feet in in 20 in

777
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,159
less than 24 hours which was really

778
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,678
amazing

779
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,840
once you have all the fiber in you need

780
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,400
to start splicing it so i've got

781
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,720
this corner has a bunch of uh service

782
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
drop cables as well as mainline cables

783
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,880
going

784
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,158
you know i've got fiber going north

785
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
south and east

786
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,520
here at this intersection plus the homes

787
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,158
on each side

788
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,799
uh are hooked up and so you get out and

789
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
you start

790
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,559
sitting on buckets on the side of the

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,360
road trying to piece stuff together

792
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,158
because i

793
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,799
i don't have a fancy splice trailer uh

794
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,480
and stuff

795
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,480
once you have it all together uh if

796
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
you've never seen an otdr trace

797
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,279
uh this is what one looks like uh and

798
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,520
you can see kind of each each place

799
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,919
along the way where i did a bad splice

800
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,360
uh you can really see that step off drop

801
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,279
uh of that and so

802
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,799
when i went to go turn up the connection

803
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,559
did this trace and it's like oh my

804
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,039
goodness i have 90 b

805
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,120
loss on you know two and a half miles of

806
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,320
fiber which is just horrible

807
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,520
uh so i go out i resplice it uh

808
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,279
you know it looks a lot better i have

809
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,520
this older splicer that's

810
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,360
i have to manually align the fibers each

811
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,240
time uh and i also need to go and

812
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,559
upgrade my

813
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
otdr because it's uh you know it's an

814
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,480
older one that i have there

815
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,279
so i've been in this industry for a long

816
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
time

817
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,880
uh i have a scheduled install date i

818
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,399
know what i'm doing i'm totally going to

819
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,600
do this

820
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,399
right well i had all sorts of issues

821
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,480
there too

822
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,760
uh you know the tech has to go install

823
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
optic and the co

824
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,640
he put the for channel 44 optic in their

825
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,279
gwdm system because he's like hey

826
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,799
we're talking to you at channel 44 uh he

827
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,600
goes and he plugs that in

828
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,520
uh he put it in the only system that had

829
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,399
channel 44 available which makes a lot

830
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
of sense

831
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,320
but that actually wasn't the case uh

832
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,760
when when they came out and they tested

833
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,480
the fiber hand off to me

834
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,919
uh the guy put a one gig optic and a 10

835
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,200
db attenuator

836
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,840
uh you know in in their system

837
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
uh and that was that was left over and

838
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,480
so

839
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,439
obviously would that was done wrong um

840
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,120
he delivered a 10

841
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,480
the 10 gig object to my house for what i

842
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,039
was supposed to be doing

843
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,840
uh he actually handed me a 10 gig lr

844
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,480
which is

845
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
like a 10 kilometer reach uh but it was

846
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,159
you know it's not

847
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,960
dwdm and it's not the 80 kilometers that

848
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,640
needs to be

849
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,320
i also had the carrier wanted to give me

850
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,840
like a really big switch and say

851
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,360
hey i want to give you this cpe i want

852
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
to give you a 6500

853
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,360
if you've never seen one of those i

854
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,120
think you know a quarter rack a half

855
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,959
rack piece of equipment

856
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,719
i pleaded with them i said no it's my

857
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,000
house i really don't want to have

858
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,240
like a 2 kw base load added to my house

859
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
uh and i don't want to add add

860
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,200
additional power drops

861
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,720
so it's a friday night what what are you

862
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,320
supposed to do

863
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,600
uh i go uh i i end up ultimately talking

864
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,120
to this tech

865
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,840
uh who's just amazing uh you know i met

866
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
him

867
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,320
friday night at 7 00 pm uh i had to

868
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,000
drive an hour

869
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,080
to get up to there i gave them back

870
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,880
their their optic he gave me a one gig

871
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,559
optic

872
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
uh visited a friend up there in lansing

873
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,000
i drove home i plugged in the optic

874
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,080
and all of a sudden boom my lint king

875
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,320
comes up

876
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,918
so looking at you know stuff before on

877
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
my wireless

878
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,039
connection i've got about a 30

879
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,760
millisecond latency

880
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,200
uh to my server in chicago afterwards

881
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
i'm about eight and a half

882
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,240
milliseconds really big difference you

883
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,720
know

884
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,480
you you put together your trace routes

885
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,200
all all the good things you want

886
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,159
um this this is from my smoke ping this

887
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
shows kind of the

888
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,600
visual reduction of the latency and all

889
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,360
that

890
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,039
so what am i supposed to do i was

891
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,600
expecting to get this 10 gig link

892
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
it's a one gig they haven't set up bgp

893
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,760
yet

894
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,480
um you know i'm already on plan b or c

895
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,640
or d or something now so i end up taking

896
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,480
the one gig dwdm optic i put it in this

897
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,279
edge router x sfp

898
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,799
it can totally do nat um i wasn't

899
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,240
expecting to do 10 gigs of traffic

900
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,918
immediately anyways

901
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,520
you know it's really you know i signed a

902
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,960
multi-year contract for

903
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,799
for access uh so i i wanna

904
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,720
i wanted to have it be easy to upgrade

905
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,600
without having to take everything down

906
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,279
so i drop that thing in i flip over my

907
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
default route onto this new path

908
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,799
i knock to the win ip because i'm not

909
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,239
routing my ip space yet

910
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,799
and then when you do you run a speech

911
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
test and this is you know i say slide to

912
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,840
make dave happy because dave

913
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,799
there's this guy dave tempkin who works

914
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,678
at uh uh at netflix

915
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,320
so i've got all my neighbors pre-wired

916
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,480
uh

917
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,000
you know juicy agreement with the wisp i

918
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,679
go i take that i remove all the rate

919
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,559
limiters under service i send them a

920
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,679
text message

921
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,279
they're like yowza you know so

922
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,320
eventually we get the optics swapped

923
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,600
we get the attenuator you know removed

924
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,158
uh we get btp up

925
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,000
and everything else so i've got people i

926
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,559
started to wire them up in the spring

927
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,399
uh some of them were connected in late

928
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,559
august or early september

929
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,320
you know i paused the installations for

930
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,480
you know um

931
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,360
in september because my wife had surgery

932
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,519
i also

933
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,439
uh i also stopped doing some installs

934
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,720
because i got tired of cutting people's

935
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,519
dsl lines uh because att's contractor

936
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,320
wouldn't mark

937
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,440
uh you know i wouldn't mark them all

938
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,360
correctly and

939
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,200
you know it feels really bad taking down

940
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,399
people's service

941
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,760
so what what it cost you know i spent

942
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,479
about 95 000 you know for my uh

943
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,360
contractor just for labor uh you know

944
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,720
i've had

945
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:54,799
you know about 32 000 of stuff

946
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,360
you know i i don't know it is you know

947
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,240
it's pretty expensive it's probably

948
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,918
still cheaper

949
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,600
than moving maybe but you know

950
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,600
i have fiber i don't have to fix up the

951
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,320
house to make it sealable

952
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,799
so uh i didn't update this one but i

953
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,279
have i've got about 27 customers online

954
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,320
now

955
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,960
uh the wireless isp he's connected uh

956
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,918
he's connected to me i actually have uh

957
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,080
i think 11

958
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,960
people who i'm working on installing

959
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,080
right now

960
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,480
uh still still left over but i'm

961
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,120
i i've actually had two more people sign

962
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
up

963
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,360
uh as i was doing work out in front of

964
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,039
their homes recently

965
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,799
um but i'm trying to i'm trying to get

966
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,600
all these people uh you know

967
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,158
connected so what's what's it you look

968
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,559
like

969
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,320
uh network usage it's you know about

970
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,000
five megabits a subscriber

971
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,760
the thing that's a little bit tricky

972
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,240
here is this actually factors in the

973
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,360
width

974
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,600
as well who has about you know two dozen

975
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,519
customers downstream for his port

976
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,600
uh where he's sending me traffic as well

977
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,440
but it's it's still kind of a reasonable

978
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,120
number

979
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,120
i have a whole bunch of people i can't

980
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,959
you know i can't even list everything

981
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,479
you know everyone i actually was just

982
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,880
out having my kids

983
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,240

984
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,120
hand holes and stuff in the back of the

985
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
truck because

986
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,399
the one two three net construction is

987
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,240
actually ongoing uh

988
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,840
right now and so i need to go drop those

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,760
where they actually talk about you know

1008
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,799
turning up really cool wireless links or

1009
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,840
you know doing fiber internet access uh

1010
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,080
and stuff and all that so uh

1011
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,360
uh joe schneider's he actually got

1012
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,480
somebody to draw this

1013
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,320
picture of me which was pretty cool so i

1014
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,039
am happy to take any questions people

1015
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,038
have about this

1016
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,839
says

1017
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,079
knowing what you know now um

1018
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,480
would you redo this again or was it more

1019
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,399
work than you expected

1020
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,839
it's definitely more work than i

1021
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,118
expected

1022
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,159
um but it was i think it was very

1023
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,119
rewarding work

1024
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,079
uh that that is some that is something

1025
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,679
you know i had to leave a meeting

1026
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,119
when when we got the stop work order i

1027
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,639
had to leave a meeting i was in

1028
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,400
with finance and my vp to go out

1029
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,680
and deal with the situation that was

1030
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,440
emerging on the road

1031
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,078
nearby me uh and so there's a lot of

1032
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,880
things

1033
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,000
that there's a lot of sacrifices that

1034
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,960
had to be made

1035
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,800
uh in order to make this possible but

1036
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,400
the big thing is when michigan school

1037
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,200
doesn't start until

1038
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,640
uh after labor day which uh you know if

1039
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,480
you're international it's you know right

1040
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,000
after the beginning of september

1041
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,720
and to get the service up

1042
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,480
and get this all ready such that all the

1043
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,520
schools around me were starting virtual

1044
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,359
to get that ready

1045
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,440
and to help the community out help the

1046
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,319
neighbors et cetera get them

1047
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,599
get them online uh and prioritizing

1048
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,560
homes with children

1049
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,240
is really i i think it's something where

1050
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,880
it takes a lot of skills to piece all

1051
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
this together

1052
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,320
i'm blessed that i was able to piece

1053
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,160
this together for a lot of these people

1054
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,160
and make it possible for them to

1055
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,680
to work from home including i have a

1056
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,480
principal who lives on my street and i

1057
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,919
have a teacher

1058
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,160
who lives on my street and so they've

1059
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,480
been able to to

1060
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,240
do things from home uh especially as

1061
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,160
school started rituals so

1062
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,680
so that for me is really i think the the

1063
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,520
big rewarding piece

1064
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,879
uh from doing this but it's it's a lot

1065
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
of work i was out

1066
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,599
you know we had unseasonably warm

1067
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
weather the past couple days and i've

1068
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,240
been out

1069
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,479
hooking people still hooking people up

1070
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,839
it's it's a lot of work

1071
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,119
i i probably would out i would contract

1072
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,520
out more of the stuff

1073
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,040
but uh because i made assurances to

1074
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,880
these people that they get connected at

1075
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,279
certain prices i can't really

1076
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,920
uh i can't fully afford to out to

1077
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,720
outsource

1078
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,280
that rate uh quite yet i'm gonna charge

1079
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,680
you more money next time

1080
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,119
okay and jeff has a question which he

1081
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,560
entered in the chat

1082
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,720
what's your budget for dealing with

1083
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,720
outages and fiber repairs from idiots

1084
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,480
eating your fiber

1085
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,200
so all um pretty much uh my budget is

1086
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,920
200

1087
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,200
a month uh you know i can go back to the

1088
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
slide that showed that

1089
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,680
so um so so the budget is you know 200

1090
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,200
bucks a month

1091
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,319
um but i haven't had any i've only had

1092
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,439
one person cut their fiber uh

1093
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,560
you know in all this time uh and it was

1094
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,040
one of my neighbors

1095
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,560
and ones it was really funny because i

1096
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,520
got a text from

1097
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,640
the wife at that house saying uh the

1098
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,759
landscapers

1099
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,960
cut their fiber uh and then i go over

1100
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,480
and investigate and i

1101
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,280
and i talk to the husband and he says

1102
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,160
yeah i cut the fiber

1103
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,839
you know on accident so so it's it's

1104
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,839
kind of funny but then they were like oh

1105
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,920
we're actually just gonna like take this

1106
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,440
as a blessing and uh

1107
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,520
you know and and go out and uh you know

1108
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,400
go out of town for a few days and so

1109
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,759
uh you know it's i i now have all the

1110
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,040
you know i have all the proper repair

1111
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,839
equipment so i can go out

1112
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,440
and uh you know and fix stuff and dig up

1113
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,240
and kind of add a section

1114
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,760
uh but you know it's uh

1115
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,160
for the most part once it's in the

1116
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,160
ground uh

1117
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,440
it it doesn't get dug up that's why a

1118
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,118
lot of the people

1119
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,800
uh put the stuff in you know in the

1120
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,720
ground and um

1121
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,240
at least around here like this is on a

1122
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,240
main road that i drive

1123
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,598
past every single day so if somebody's

1124
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,040
gonna be out digging on it

1125
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,960
i'm gonna see it uh you know and

1126
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,320
and all my stuff is protected in conduit

1127
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
so they really gotta be

1128
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,920
you know it's it's down the contractor

1129
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,079
put it down six feet deep

1130
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,160
in some places and it's deeper than that

1131
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,160
um you know obviously where it crosses

1132
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,200
where there's a 10 foot culvert

1133
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,920
so i am uh

1134
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,200
i'm not too worried about it but i you

1135
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,280
know i have money set aside

1136
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,279
in the budget for that okay okay

1137
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,720
um

1138
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,078
jen's in the queue oh she is

1139
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,079
sorry go ahead jen

1140
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
is that pretty cool i'm just curious so

1141
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,599
are you now

1142
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,839
like 24 by 7 on call for this thing

1143
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,839
what's your support model

1144
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,839
effectively yes oh my god

1145
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,680
so so uh it it's actually even worse

1146
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,078
than that in some ways

1147
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,440
so because i'm a member of the 8-1-1

1148
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,040
system

1149
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,359
i actually i have obligations under

1150
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,680
there to go out and mark my fiber

1151
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,119
um as a pro you know if somebody is

1152
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,240
going to go dig

1153
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,000
and the way you do that the way you do

1154
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,439
that if you upload a shape file or you

1155
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,480
upload a html

1156
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,320
that can now do kml's and

1157
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,240
you upload that same this is the area

1158
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,119
that i'm that i have some responsibility

1159
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,959
for

1160
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:46,560
and if somebody digs up like a gas

1161
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,040
line or if somebody's electrical service

1162
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,320
line

1163
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,359
underground fails or or something

1164
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,720
i can get i can be required

1165
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,240
to show up on two hours notice uh

1166
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,799
to go and mark my fiber uh

1167
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,560
if i want to protect that and so with

1168
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
that it's really

1169
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,960
it's you know it's interesting so you

1170
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,640
know the follow-up question i'm sure is

1171
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,640
so what happens if i'm on a plane to

1172
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,000
bangkok

1173
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,078
so i have uh i've helped out the

1174
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,160
existing wireless isp for

1175
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,760
the past 10 years off and on with his

1176
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,359
stuff and uh

1177
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,280
he's basically signed up to help do

1178
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,839
repairs and stuff when when i'm out of

1179
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,920
town

1180
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,960
i uh as i've done for him when he's been

1181
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,960
out of town uh

1182
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,680
traveling for uh you know on family

1183
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,760
vacations or otherwise

1184
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,000
but yeah it's uh it's a big obligation

1185
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
wow

1186
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,920
do you want to reply to jeff's

1187
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,920
chat question

1188
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,720
yeah so

1189
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,160
so i i yeah i can absolutely respond to

1190
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,040
this one so

1191
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
this is actually a profitable project

1192
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,960
like i

1193
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,720
am i am bringing in

1194
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,319
positive cash flow every month from

1195
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,078
doing this project so

1196
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,000
so so just question sorry jeff's

1197
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,280
question is you know why do i think it's

1198
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,280
viable for me to do this

1199
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,359
because i i can actually buy wholesale

1200
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,599
internet for a reasonable price

1201
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,400
uh you know up up at the corner you know

1202
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,640
you can't but i wasn't able to do it

1203
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,839
at my house because a lot of the

1204
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,920
commercial

1205
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,078
models that these carriers use is that

1206
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,359
they want roi to be 12 months

1207
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,680
and i i'm happy with you know

1208
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,560
a four-year roi because that's what i

1209
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,720
would

1210
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,680
you know i would burn through that money

1211
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,919
in trying to

1212
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,359
make my home ready to be sellable to

1213
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,800
deal with all of this

1214
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,720
the drama that you have to deal with

1215
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,599
when you move hiring movers

1216
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,359
uh you know getting all that stuff done

1217
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,960
and

1218
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,560
the the thing the things that are really

1219
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,560
broken here are that fact that

1220
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,920
there's that there is that fiber 1200

1221
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,759
feet from my house

1222
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,599
almost every single person i've hooked

1223
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,079
up there is fiber

1224
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,040
in you know in front of their house or

1225
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,640
within

1226
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,400
you know a quarter of a mile

1227
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,680
and that i think is the thing that's

1228
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,640
really amazing is

1229
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,359
you have att in the us who basically has

1230
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
said we're no

1231
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,680
we're discontinuing our traditional dsl

1232
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
service you have to be able to be on

1233
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,319
the high speed like the vdsl uh you know

1234
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,280
services are better

1235
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,880
uh to to do this and i i think the big

1236
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,400
thing is you have to have people who are

1237
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,720
willing to invest in it

1238
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,920
and just take a slightly longer roi

1239
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,399
model

1240
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:44,000
comcast they want a 12-month roi for

1241
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:47,119
their investment

1242
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,079
uh so

1243
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,440
just responding to jeff you know if it's

1244
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,160
viable for me why isn't it

1245
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,760
viable for them it's it's that you know

1246
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,720
like i said i'm willing to take a 42

1247
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,160
month roi

1248
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,759
on my initial investment um i also put a

1249
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,240
lot of sweat equity into there where if

1250
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,560
i

1251
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
had out some of it if i had outsourced

1252
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,520
it it would have actually cost me the

1253
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,720
same or less

1254
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,640
uh you know especially if i value my

1255
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,279
time it's something other than zero

1256
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,640
but a lot of this is you know it's like

1257
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
many things it's labor of love

1258
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,280
so for eric

1259
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,359
you know he's asking what sorts of

1260
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,560
environmental concerns affect the fibers

1261
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,400
no water table

1262
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,839
into pipes etc so many of these things

1263
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,160
the uh the fiber is actually protected

1264
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,119
uh quite heavily so it's not only in

1265
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,399
conduit

1266
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,119
uh in that corner where it's

1267
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,839
wet or or where there's that uh giant

1268
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,119
drain

1269
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,400
uh i actually when

1270
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,040
uh it gets wet nearby that corner and

1271
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,880
my hand hole on the north side actually

1272
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,480
has water that will flow through it from

1273
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,920
the north to the south side

1274
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,880
because that's the path of least

1275
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,000
resistance between the two locations

1276
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,880
um and it took some while it took uh

1277
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,359
so the fiber for the most part is is

1278
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,000
fine with that because it's not only has

1279
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,359
uh it's in the conduit even if the

1280
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,040
conduit has water in it

1281
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,640
it has an outer buffer you know it has

1282
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,440
outer protective jacket

1283
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,000
uh it's got two it's got uh strength

1284
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,839
members

1285
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,839
fiberglass strength members that can be

1286
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,119
compacted and then it has the inner

1287
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,480
buffer tube which also could be

1288
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,319
compacted on top of that

1289
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,040
so even if it goes through a freeze

1290
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,079
cycle uh it is relatively unlikely that

1291
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,400
it's going to be damaged

1292
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,760
and even if it even if that happens

1293
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,280
through the entire project i actually

1294
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,480
pulled two conduits

1295
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,760
uh because it was only uh the materials

1296
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,119
plus the labor

1297
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,960
were only 60 cents more a foot and so

1298
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,160
for uh you know a 14

1299
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,760
000 15 000 foot project you know it

1300
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,879
basically was

1301
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,400
not a significant expense to go and uh

1302
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,920
pull a second conduit so i have

1303
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,839
opportunities to correct all of the

1304
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,839
mistakes that i made along the way

1305
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,920
and then brian dixon i i kind of missed

1306
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,879
your question how many subscribers do i

1307
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,560
need to be able to

1308
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:20,480
retire um uh

1309
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,680
a lot more but what's interesting is i

1310
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,319
actually have

1311
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,440
so so our county did this broadband

1312
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,400
study

1313
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,960
and the people who run that are some of

1314
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,240
the or

1315
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,240
one of the people who got the contract

1316
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,680
for that is actually somebody who is

1317
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,040
part of that original broadband

1318
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,879
cooperative effort

1319
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,160
uh and actually built there's a there's

1320
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,880
a network in detroit

1321
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,839
called rocket fiber and he he did a lot

1322
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,960
of the design

1323
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,200
for that and he

1324
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,640
actually because he he got a contract to

1325
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,799
drive the entire county

1326
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,319
go down every road and everything so he

1327
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,520
figured out who has

1328
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:59,200
services services where and what and how

1329
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,480
and he's he's now identified and people

1330
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,759
talked to him while he was out doing

1331
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,200
that

1332
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,839
he has identified uh some pockets of

1333
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,879
areas where people are willing to pay

1334
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,119
uh to have service extended to them

1335
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,400
so what's funny is aside from the large

1336
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,000
incumbents like att

1337
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,520
and comcast in my area um i'm actually

1338
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,079
the largest i'm the largest independent

1339
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,960
fire to the home provider in my county

1340
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:30,079
at having you know 20 some subscribers

1341
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,319
um or yes yes and it's almost 30 now

1342
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,079
um you know having 20 some subscribers

1343
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,240
signed up and so

1344
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,440
um to to get enough customers to be

1345
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,959
financially independent i

1346
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,280
i have this problem of my day job

1347
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,960
probably pays me a little bit too much

1348
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,119
ah and so because of that you know

1349
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,000
uh i would need to get much bigger in

1350
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,480
order to offset that

1351
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,480
so warren is asking whether or not i've

1352
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:58,160
had any legal issues from the incumbents

1353
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,839
no i'm a telephone company just like

1354
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,560
they are they could permit this and do

1355
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,319
it just

1356
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,680
just the same way they can go read my

1357
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,680
tariff if they want to buy

1358
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:11,839
services from me under my tariff they

1359
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,839
absolutely can

1360
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,400
my tariff's funny everything's what's

1361
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,319
called

1362
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:25,839
everything's icb individual case basis

1363
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,839
so i can price it however i want

1364
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,319
let me look and make sure nobody else is

1365
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,319
in the queue

1366
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,118
nope so with that

1367
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:53,839
i am going to see what happens when i do

1368
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,839
that and stop screen sharing

1369
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:07,040
so let me pull up the other slides that

1370
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:09,079
i did up

1371
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,079
and this is going to be a little more

1372
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,079
show-and-tell-ish

1373
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,200
and warren or chris if you can press the

1374
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,839
magic button

1375
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,839
thank you

1376
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,610
[Music]

1377
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,040
so i just so th this i wanted to do a

1378
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,759
little bit more

1379
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,480
on this so please treat this like a

1380
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,480
lightning talk

1381
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,520
so i don't know how many people remember

1382
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,558
um

1383
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,119
august 30th we had

1384
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:51,440
uh as209 well the legacy quest asm

1385
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,200
now centurylink it's got parts you know

1386
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,040
level three global crossing all these

1387
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:58,240
people who've been all rolled together

1388
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,400
you know into uh into a big network

1389
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,799
and so i i wanted to you know one of the

1390
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,280
things i regularly do is i look at

1391
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,160
um you know the route views bgp update

1392
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,440
data

1393
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,118
uh and i look for ways to identify

1394
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,640
events

1395
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,319
and what i did is i ended up writing

1396
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,078
writing some code to process the bgp

1397
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,079
data now because what

1398
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,319
what happened during that event or

1399
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,720
apparently happened during that event is

1400
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:28,160
uh they sort of stopped processing bgp

1401
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,799
withdrawals they would still advertise

1402
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,558
routes

1403
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,079
for which they didn't have reachability

1404
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,079
you know and

1405
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,079
and and that that is a very interesting

1406
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:39,119
event in and of itself

1407
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,160
so so i went and i took some data and

1408
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,720
i kind of poked through that and

1409
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,160
came up with this metric of you know you

1410
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,240
measure the number of announced

1411
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,000
routes divided by the withdrawn routes

1412
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,520
over the time period

1413
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,200
so the route view state the routeview's

1414
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:00,240
um uh mrt data

1415
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,879
has information about what the pure dsn

1416
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,200
is

1417
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,720
uh and stuff and i and i took this that

1418
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,960
all this data and i bucketed

1419
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,558
it into six segment intervals so you

1420
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,880
know a tenth of a minute

1421
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,200
and i kept track of the global

1422
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,520
measurement so all of the data

1423
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,200
you know through all of the uh the peers

1424
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,079
for that uh that time window for that

1425
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,200
data file

1426
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:24,640
um as well as the per asn uh

1427
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,319
data and so when you go and you look at

1428
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,920
a day like uh

1429
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:34,000
like the the 30th of august

1430
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,520
you actually end up with something like

1431
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,480
this and you can actually see in this

1432
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,440
graph

1433
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,359
um and this you know my graphana is set

1434
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,640
up to it shows me data in my local time

1435
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,960
zone so if you

1436
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,359
kind of click through this link um

1437
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,880
because the slides should be online

1438
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,400
um you should be able to go and see this

1439
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,079
you can actually see the time period

1440
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,680
where the service provider said hey

1441
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,680
we're going to deep here

1442
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,440
um you know the the 209 network

1443
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,680
uh and you can see this view from behind

1444
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,960
ntt which is the classic network that i

1445
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,839
pick on for

1446
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,839
hopefully obvious reasons and so

1447
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,319
pretty please be very nice to this

1448
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,359
machine it is an intel

1449
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:21,200
nuke sitting downstairs in my basement

1450
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:24,078
and um please and i loaded all of the

1451
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,439
route views data that is available for

1452
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,359
the bgp updates

1453
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,040
uh you know all the way back to i think

1454
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,040
it was 2000 or something

1455
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,319
uh is is when it's there i have the data

1456
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,319
in influx if you

1457
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,240
if somebody wants to get a replicated

1458
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,800
feed of it i'm happy to

1459
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,558
to go and do that but i went back and i

1460
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,680
and it took a couple weeks to do this

1461
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,839
i went back and i you know

1462
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,000
post-processed all that data because

1463
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,880
i didn't use super fast computers to do

1464
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,800
it and all that

1465
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:55,920
and uh and fed all stuff through so

1466
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,920
with that let me show you

1467
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,118
hopefully this does the right thing yep

1468
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,559
it does

1469
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,839
and so this is actually the day

1470
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,160
of uh of that event and like i said this

1471
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,000
is

1472
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,200
you know in my local time zone and what

1473
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,200
you can actually see

1474
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,919
is the network impact for these

1475
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,759
different as's

1476
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,720
and so for some of them you know you can

1477
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,960
see you know here's the 2914 one

1478
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,240
uh which looks kind of interesting you

1479
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,040
know because obviously you have this

1480
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,439
period where

1481
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,160
there's an instability you can see it in

1482
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,359
the graph

1483
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,000
and then you have this quiet you know

1484
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,640
you have this kind of quiet threshold

1485
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,200
and a number that i use is kind of 50 if

1486
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,759
if this ratio gets above 50

1487
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,200
um you know that that really shows

1488
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,839
something interesting and so

1489
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,319
you know the the provider number you

1490
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,160
know

1491
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,359
or the number of announcements withdraws

1492
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,078
is on the left side

1493
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,839
and on the right hand side is this uh

1494
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,960
you know is this ratio

1495
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,640
and so you can go and actually use this

1496
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,640
to determine what networks were really

1497
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,879
adversely impacted

1498
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,680
uh based on the data that shows up in

1499
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,119
route views

1500
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,919
during this time period so you can see

1501
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,079
people who uh you know were maybe not

1502
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,040
too impacted and then picking on this as

1503
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,079
i'm not sure who this

1504
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,480
is but you can really see they were they

1505
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,440
were

1506
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,839
very uh this network here was very badly

1507
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,559
impacted and very spiky during this

1508
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:21,759
this time period for what that event

1509
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,960
actually did for them

1510
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,880
did to them and so i would like to go

1511
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,319
back and do a bit more of a study of

1512
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,800
this and say okay

1513
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,800
with this type of data can you you know

1514
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,680
to what extent can you detect these

1515
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,559
these levels of network instability um

1516
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,319
you know

1517
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,920
can you measure these and figure out

1518
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,520
okay which providers are either

1519
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,680
originating this instability

1520
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,839
or which ones are severely impacted by

1521
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,160
external instability and so this

1522
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,960
this provider you can actually look at

1523
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,000
what

1524
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,480
what was seen by their asm

1525
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,119
and you can actually see they were

1526
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,240
severely

1527
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,599
impacted during this entire time period

1528
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,680
uh by the instability uh

1529
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,880
that was globally visible you can see it

1530
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,960
during the event

1531
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,520
you can see the portions where either

1532
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:13,200
they disconnected or tried to disconnect

1533
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,040
when they reconnected you can see

1534
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,558
basically these very clear lines when

1535
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,960
you graph them with the before and after

1536
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,960
period

1537
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,640
and so i wanted to do this to go and

1538
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,040
find

1539
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,960
all sorts of other events uh that that

1540
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,920
may be interesting so hopefully you guys

1541
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,359
didn't

1542
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,880
i see it's not loading hopefully you

1543
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,279
guys didn't kill kill the machine but

1544
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,720
you're

1545
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,319
like i said you're kind of welcome to

1546
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,439
poke around in there

1547
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,880
um and if you want uh you know i figure

1548
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,040
some people like jeff are probably

1549
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,520
already in there uh poking around and

1550
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,200
you can

1551
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,799
you can go and look at specific time

1552
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,160
ranges and kind of pick out

1553
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,480
you know okay this this is when

1554
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,799
something happened so when we pick i

1555
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,119
think

1556
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,359
you know uh tata and talia have had

1557
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,640
different events in the past two years

1558
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,720
and they really stand out on these

1559
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,160
graphs but i didn't i didn't have enough

1560
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,680
time in between

1561
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:05,040
you know my day job and my night job

1562
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,240
uh and uh you know everything else to

1563
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,400
kind of put together any

1564
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:10,160
better slides on this or present some

1565
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,599
more of the the data of the events

1566
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,480
but i i found this to be a very accurate

1567
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,920
metric

1568
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:35,839
for detecting when something is going on

1569
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:35,839
so i'll skip to questions

1570
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,839
i suspect people are clicking around on

1571
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,000
all the pretty chats and graphs and

1572
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:51,040
stuff

1573
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,760
the moment um

1574
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,040
so we do actually have another surprise

1575
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,040
presentation

1576
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,920
um from randy and

1577
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,799
we will let him take that away thank you

1578
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,480
very much jerry

1579
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,960
i'm assuming you will still be around if

1580
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,559
people want to put questions in the chat

1581
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,559
um excellent

1582
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,720
thank you very much we will now try and

1583
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,839
do the screen sharing dance again

1584
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,839
thank you very much

1585
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:36,960
no audio or no screen share working yet

1586
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,959
um

1587
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,400
we can see you though that's always a

1588
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,399
plus

1589
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,720
still no audio

1590
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,280
says that you've got audio

1591
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,240
just going to the

1592
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:59,839
nope nope

1593
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,160
i keep my piece of paper

1594
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,920
i keep my piece of paper with the we

1595
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,079
cannot hear you

1596
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,400
and the more useful stupid technology

1597
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,400
one

1598
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,160
we will let you know when we hear you

1599
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,640
i i anxiously await comic sans slides

1600
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:35,839
and what's more comic sans in purple or

1601
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,839
magenta

1602
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,839
i suspect that it is

1603
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,720
some audio

1604
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:55,839
you can quiet it sounded like randy

1605
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,839
quietly though

1606
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,760
i'm assuming that randy is using a mac

1607
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,920
and will have to grant

1608
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,799
whatever browser he's using screen

1609
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,280
sharing permissions i would suspect

1610
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:14,240
because that's often the

1611
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:23,839
failure is that the browser does not

1612
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:23,839
have rights

1613
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,559
uh that i suspect that that's not the

1614
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,160
mic you're using because it's very quiet

1615
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,640
it sounds like it's not quite plugged in

1616
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,640
all the way

1617
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:55,440
yeah quietly

1618
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:55,440
sure the screen is gone

1619
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:10,160
well

1620
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,160
um where's the audio chooser button

1621
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,520
up on the top right there is the thing

1622
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,119
that lets you choose which

1623
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,799
audio device i'm assuming you have

1624
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,079
thrown with that the

1625
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:22,880
thing that looks like a monkey wrench

1626
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,880
and a screwdriver

1627
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,079
um and that might

1628
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,520
give you a hint as to which mic it

1629
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,200
thinks it's using because it doesn't

1630
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:47,839
seem to be the lapel

1631
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:47,839
slash headset mike

1632
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:01,520
okay so

1633
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:05,040
it's telling us

1634
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,119
so on a mac

1635
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,359
if you click on this system preferences

1636
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:14,640
thing

1637
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:17,520
and then security and privacy

1638
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,520
and the

1639
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,040
screen recording sorry security and

1640
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,720
privacy and then privacy and then screen

1641
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,359
recording

1642
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,319
um your browser should be a listed there

1643
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,319
and have a check mark

1644
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,118
and if that's not working then i can

1645
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,280
just try and present

1646
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:42,559
the slides that you gave me earlier but

1647
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,960
we still can't hear you very well

1648
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,480
and you have to restart the project oh

1649
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,799
yes you need to restart the browser

1650
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,480
after granting it permissions because

1651
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:55,680
it's the mac um

1652
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:58,799
privacy thing only gets

1653
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:11,839
capabilities only get granted at

1654
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:11,839
operating system application startup

1655
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:17,520
so while randy's redoing stuff

1656
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,558
so yeah for my carrying on for my

1657
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,359
earlier thing

1658
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,000
yeah i know that you count as a a telco

1659
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:24,078
just

1660
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,040
um when some friends and i had started

1661
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,480
looking

1662
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,400
um our local cable provider started

1663
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,720
making all sorts of you know we will

1664
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,760
create legal entertainment for you

1665
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,720
um excitement and you know

1666
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,559
make sure that you have lawyers ready so

1667
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,399
when we drag you in front of

1668
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,559
of various it was fairly clear it was

1669
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,000
just harassment type

1670
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:51,200
tech behavior but

1671
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,240
hopefully we will have a randy back soon

1672
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:56,960
so just to talk about that warren

1673
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,399
what uh that was actually one of the

1674
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,480
issues

1675
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,039
that i had with the permitting process

1676
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,079
is that i was delayed because the state

1677
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,240
didn't list me

1678
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,480
immediately on the list of

1679
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,359
telecommunications providers

1680
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,920
uh and that that delayed them so they're

1681
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,680
like oh well we're not gonna

1682
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,960
you know we're gonna wait on processing

1683
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,799
your permit application

1684
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,240
and they waited 30 days every single

1685
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:22,799
time we turned in

1686
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,399
new print so they would say go fix this

1687
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:26,960
oh we're going to wait 30

1688
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,880
30 days and then respond to you 28 days

1689
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,559
or 28 days later

1690
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:37,039
a good email from them being like oh

1691
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,039
change this so

1692
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,039
it was nice whenever when finally got

1693
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,759
the permit paperwork

1694
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,760
and everything else

1695
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,680
so wonder why randy's screen share is

1696
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,078
not working but if he's

1697
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,480
i can hopefully share the last set of

1698
01:02:52,079 --> 01:02:56,640
slides you gave me

1699
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,240
um or if you quickly email me the

1700
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,480
updated set of slides

1701
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,640
i could share those and you can just say

1702
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,680
next and i can

1703
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,680
can click the buttons

1704
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:13,520
especially if you happen to have them as

1705
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,760
pdf otherwise i can convert them

1706
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:21,200
either will work

1707
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,200
yay technology

1708
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:31,839
actually yay security and privacy

1709
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,400
so i have mailed it to you do you hear

1710
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,500
me yet

1711
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,280
yes we hear you much better now

1712
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:46,000
[Music]

1713
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,640
see me um i don't have screen share

1714
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,400
enter

1715
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,920
so cue there we go i have just clicked

1716
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,319
yes i clicked yesterday

1717
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,000
screenshot to share my screen error the

1718
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:01,920
request is not allowed by the

1719
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,920
user agent or the platform

1720
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,920
should i uh firefox and go for chrome or

1721
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,680
something

1722
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,079
yeah it will probably work in chrome but

1723
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:13,200
you would still need to grant you would

1724
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,119
need to start chrome

1725
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,480
and then go back into security and

1726
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,960
privacy then

1727
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,319
chrome will show up in your list of apps

1728
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,720
both of them have

1729
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:23,440
uh ah in that case yep chrome should do

1730
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,759
it for you

1731
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,240
it's something funny with both of them

1732
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,880
have full privileges i use these for

1733
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,598
joining

1734
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,319
uh what is it microsoft teams and all

1735
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,520
that credit

1736
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:37,119
okay well if you quickly reconnect with

1737
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,960
chrome why don't you do it are you in

1738
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:43,119
the process

1739
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:47,039
okay this website uses cookies

1740
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,039
auntie by a daily track

1741
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:55,839
oh great

1742
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,839
yes

1743
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:23,839
all right so listen

1744
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,720
this is silly

1745
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,839
why are we doing this

1746
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,839
i don't like doing

1747
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:23,839
yes i want to show this

1748
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:28,960
uh application window

1749
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:31,599
this one sure

1750
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,599
any better

1751
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:39,118
psychedelic and you can hear me

1752
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,920
and we can hear you and you sound like

1753
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:45,200
you

1754
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:48,480
is this a bugger feature unclear

1755
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:52,160
oh great and it's going to flip

1756
01:06:48,480 --> 01:07:01,839
little bits at a time i love that

1757
01:06:52,160 --> 01:07:01,839
let me just resize slightly

1758
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:10,079
see if this works so geolocation ip

1759
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,720
number

1760
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,760
everybody has to live and die with it

1761
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,759
you have to deal with country

1762
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,319
regulations localized content

1763
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,920
and all that stuff and even researchers

1764
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:22,480
like it

1765
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:25,039
who's actually providing those services

1766
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,359
here's a whole list of people

1767
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,240
providing geolocation services in other

1768
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,720
words

1769
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,399
i can take an ip address and ask them

1770
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,919
where it is

1771
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:38,960
and they will come up with a guess

1772
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,599
and if your data incorrect you have to

1773
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,400
contact

1774
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,200
every one of them and every three days

1775
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,680
on that

1776
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,439
we see somebody writing all my customers

1777
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,558
can't get to

1778
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:53,920
you know free porn or whatever and

1779
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:56,720
please help me get geo located

1780
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:58,720
the problem is there is no there there

1781
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,319
there's no central repository of this

1782
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,759
information

1783
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:07,200
no strategy even there are no

1784
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,119
authoritative data companies make up

1785
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:13,038
their own data and enrich them

1786
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,640
with data from geolocation providers etc

1787
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:18,640
so it's immense so how do they do it how

1788
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:20,799
do the geolocation providers do it they

1789
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:24,239
use who is data mostly

1790
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:28,479
but also dns is strange magic

1791
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:32,318
but warren and eric and a couple others

1792
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:34,559
wrote 8805 which has this thing called

1793
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:37,600
the geofeeds file

1794
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:40,719
and that lets you take an address and

1795
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:43,920
break it to an address range a prefix

1796
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,158
and break it down by country and state

1797
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,239
and city and that kind of stuff

1798
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:53,278
and that's in rfc 8805

1799
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:56,080
oops sorry so

1800
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,159
the format for self-published in other

1801
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:00,399
words i'm an isp i should publish where

1802
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:03,358
all my garbage is

1803
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:08,000
only if i want to publish it and i can

1804
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:10,480
geo locate single ips prefixes etc

1805
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,238
longest prefix matches the game as

1806
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:15,839
always

1807
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:18,080
and you can go down to the city level

1808
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:20,640
um i gather they decided not to go to

1809
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,920
finer because in some

1810
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,400
locations finer would actually

1811
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:29,279
break privacy because you know there's

1812
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,719
only one person on the block

1813
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,880
so many geolocation providers already

1814
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,960
use geofeed files in other words they

1815
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:40,159
accept them from you

1816
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,480
so like the itf meeting when we end up

1817
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:44,719
in bangkok like we are today

1818
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,479
we give google the geofeed file for the

1819
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:49,600
ips we're using

1820
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,759
and they'll locate us properly the

1821
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,239
discussion of the geofeed file formats

1822
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:56,159
in the geofeeds working group

1823
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:58,559
i don't want to discuss it today there

1824
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,519
is no geofence working group so

1825
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:05,440
have fun but how do you find the

1826
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:08,560
geofeeds file that's what we're after

1827
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:12,080
oops so

1828
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:16,000
we suggest you use the irr who is

1829
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:19,120
look up okay and we add a remarks field

1830
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,800
to it oh look up the init number

1831
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,719
because our number gives you a nice

1832
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,760
range you get

1833
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,960
a in a remark you get a geofeed file

1834
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,080
somebody with a mic is typing

1835
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,600
okay and it's in the remarks

1836
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:38,960
which we is ugly

1837
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:40,159
so i think job is already attacking this

1838
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,400
and trying to get

1839
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,199
and the document specifies that hey if

1840
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,400
you can get a

1841
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,559
change in the rpsl you do it with the

1842
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,759
geofeed attribute instead of remarks

1843
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,120
attribute

1844
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,239
and that's in the rpslwg

1845
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,239
except there isn't one

1846
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:01,920
so what's cool though there's a dirty

1847
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,440
trick going on here

1848
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:08,480
is the rir's who

1849
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:12,239
is lookups if given an

1850
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:16,320
address give you the closest

1851
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:19,360
surrounding eyelid covering ein hydna

1852
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:23,679
magically okay

1853
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:24,239
so um somebody suggested why not use dns

1854
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,159
for this

1855
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,320
because there's not that kind of

1856
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:33,360
resolution there's not that search

1857
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,360
and the rir's magically do this for you

1858
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,840
okay and so it finds the nearest

1859
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,640
covering eye nit numb for a particular

1860
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:43,920
query

1861
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,360
geofeed files have scope you'll notice

1862
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:51,520
this geoff file has at least

1863
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:54,559
four ranges in it okay

1864
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,280
four eye net numbers can point into it

1865
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:00,400
and when following that idit number you

1866
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,400
use the longest match

1867
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,440
and only what is covered by it so if

1868
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,719
you're coming in for the inet num for

1869
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:09,040
147.28 yada yada

1870
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:11,840
you don't look at the others because

1871
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:16,080
they're not authoritative

1872
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:18,960
okay so i get numbs

1873
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,679
i need six num of course multiple of

1874
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,760
them can reach

1875
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,199
as i just pointed out to refer to the

1876
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,199
same file

1877
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:28,799
if the file is not signed and we're

1878
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:28,799
going to learn about signing in a minute

1879
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:36,719
please serve the gfe data over https

1880
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:39,839
and if the geo feed data

1881
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:42,480
were pointed to by the owners i needed

1882
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,440
them and if you believe they're

1883
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:47,759
strengthening it once

1884
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:49,360
authentication then you have some

1885
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,600
confidence

1886
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:57,040
in the geofeed's authenticity

1887
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:00,400
um who is

1888
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:03,760
let's say varies in quality so

1889
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,000
there's an optional glork i'll lead you

1890
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,760
through

1891
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,960
in a second whereas you sign a digest of

1892
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,840
the file

1893
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,960
with the private key of the rpa ki

1894
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,400
certificate

1895
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:18,560
only recovery prefix

1896
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:20,480
and by the way aaron of course is

1897
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,120
doesn't choose iron incomes they use net

1898
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:24,480
ranges

1899
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,679
who cares the signature is a strong

1900
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,360
signature

1901
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,880
just glow up at the bottom of the file

1902
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:32,320
you can see it

1903
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:35,360
um so but

1904
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:38,400
when this happens that file cannot

1905
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,440
be pointed to by multiple eye net

1906
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:42,879
numbers for different

1907
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:46,239
ranges because the signature is only

1908
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:50,719
good for that range

1909
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:53,839
okay so

1910
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:56,400
this looks painful but it isn't

1911
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,159
you can parse bulk who is data it's

1912
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,000
publicly available

1913
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:02,639
so you don't have to do all these who is

1914
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,920
queries even aaron has it partially

1915
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,199
available

1916
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,199
you can beg but there's an

1917
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:14,159
app for massimo's written one

1918
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:15,120
called geofeedfinder you just run a

1919
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,320
binary

1920
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,199
and you get all the geo feeds and the

1921
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,280
internet

1922
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:25,678
blam and i believe that's the whole

1923
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,679
story

1924
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,239
questions

1925
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:45,040
in there

1926
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,159
jeff has a question in the chat which is

1927
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,199
what exactly

1928
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:51,920
is the signature signing over um

1929
01:14:49,199 --> 01:14:51,919
is it everything

1930
01:14:52,960 --> 01:15:00,239
everything above it

1931
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,400
so it's the textbook that's above it yes

1932
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:02,400
it's

1933
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:07,839
it's actually signing over a digest of

1934
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,840
the text of course

1935
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,759
and then jeff has the following question

1936
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,400
including comment lines

1937
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,880
it's disgustingly specified in the draft

1938
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:16,879
by the way

1939
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,120
further comment by jeff i've got to dig

1940
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,120
for it just to start

1941
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:45,440
remember i test asn 1 starting text

1942
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:46,000
read the draft including the comment

1943
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,799
lines

1944
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,800
read the draft

1945
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:55,519
yes you could change the signature just

1946
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,400
cover just the relevant lines but which

1947
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,400
relevant lines

1948
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:03,440
as uh now that's the wrong draft eric

1949
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:06,719
you'll have to change ymdk

1950
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:09,759
to ietf because it's actually working

1951
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,760
with document now

1952
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,239
but otherwise eric is correct

1953
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,600
and i can pop up the document of course

1954
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,600
and bore you with it

1955
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:34,400
but to jeff's point uh

1956
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:36,239
russ has done a solid job at the signups

1957
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,480
the problem with the signing isn't so

1958
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:40,639
much the

1959
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,199
uh what it signs over how you do the

1960
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,760
digest and all that noise

1961
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:47,519
the problem is how you get the key

1962
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,719
[Music]

1963
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,719
with which to sign

1964
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:58,560
okay and i believe that

1965
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:02,000
uh george michaelson

1966
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:05,199
and some others i forget who have

1967
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,400
had a proposal to spot now expire draft

1968
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:17,839
it's pointed to an hard drive

1969
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:17,839
which suggests how to do that

1970
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,719
let me see if i can figure out how to

1971
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,919
share

1972
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:30,640
a look at the draft itself

1973
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:33,739
since that seems to be of interest

1974
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,739
[Music]

1975
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,840
uh

1976
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:51,349
[Music]

1977
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,600
yep and i need to click the button

1978
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:04,080
granting you access

1979
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,080
i didn't change my mind or anything

1980
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:13,840
oh application

1981
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,840
like this one

1982
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:24,840
modern science so

1983
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,159
the first question is what you sign over

1984
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,200
jeff

1985
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:31,250
and

1986
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,250
[Music]

1987
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:37,199
it's we made up a trust anchor for this

1988
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:55,840
the end enemy shirt is displayed it's

1989
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:55,840
the usual gork you've seen it before

1990
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,159
and out the other end

1991
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:10,159
probably can will this survive me

1992
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,480
stretching the window

1993
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,480
yes

1994
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,678
so

1995
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,239
um

1996
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,919
but the key is the

1997
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,719
issue

1998
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,960
so i think that's what you really want

1999
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:43,199
jeff

2000
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:50,080
can't you give him the mic can't we all

2001
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:51,360
just talk

2002
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:54,400
people should be able to talk by

2003
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:54,400
clicking the mic icon

2004
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:08,159
yes it's the rta which we

2005
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:12,400
would like to be revived

2006
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:16,239
jeff he's in chat saying the rta

2007
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:20,320
we would love the rta to be revived

2008
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:22,480
because that solves getting the key

2009
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:25,920
you can't actually dig for the key but

2010
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:27,599
there are no common tools for it

2011
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,679
people by the way are actually using

2012
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:33,280
this

2013
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:35,679
it's actually destroying things in the

2014
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,679
wild

2015
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,400
so um those of us who are paranoid would

2016
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:45,440
like to see more authenticity

2017
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:47,440
but reality probably people compared to

2018
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,480
what they're doing for geofeed data

2019
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:52,879
today

2020
01:20:48,480 --> 01:21:01,839
on earth again unauthenticated who is

2021
01:20:52,880 --> 01:21:01,840
is probably a distinct improvement

2022
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,199
you know

2023
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,560
enough said

2024
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:19,280
yep i think so uh thank you for

2025
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:20,879
being willing to do this at short notice

2026
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:24,159
sorry for the sloppiness i

2027
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:26,400
would totally unprepared you rehearsed

2028
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:27,519
no worries sorry about the entertainment

2029
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,679
worth trying to make

2030
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,719
big sharing work i don't know if

2031
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:33,920
anybody's got

2032
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:37,600
any other questions but

2033
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:39,360
if not um we will

2034
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,360
call this done for now thank you

2035
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,320
everyone i think we're all looking

2036
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:44,400
forward

2037
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,159
yep i think we're all looking forward to

2038
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,280
being able to see everybody in person

2039
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:50,400
again

2040
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:51,840
um unfortunately not in prague but

2041
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,199
possibly

2042
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:58,719
in san francisco i think is

2043
01:21:55,199 --> 01:22:00,480
what the next one's scheduled for um

2044
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,639
i believe that there will be a recording

2045
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:06,799
of this later

2046
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:07,520
and if anybody's got any other last

2047
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,560
questions

2048
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:13,280
thank you very much and good night or

2049
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,400
good morning or good afternoon and thank

2050
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:17,040
you to miraco

2051
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,280
who i assume uh is here late at night or

2052
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,639
early in the morning

2053
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,480
actually they said they weren't going to

2054
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:25,040
make it and we were on our own

2055
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,559
but um largely because it is the middle

2056
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,639
of the night slash early in the morning

2057
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,400
slash something awful for them

2058
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:36,400
so thank you very much everybody

2059
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,839
and see you at the next reunion

2060
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:39,839

2061
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:25,520
