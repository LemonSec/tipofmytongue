1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,079
again good morning good afternoon

2
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,760
good evening um to everybody joining us

3
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,760
so this is the mark session

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,800
today from the chair screw where crew

5
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
2 with me and tim

6
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,000
let's get started

7
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,479
so i assume people have already

8
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,679
seen note well if you haven't seen it uh

9
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,679
please have a look and read relevant

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
documents

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,199
so uh we're using meteco um

12
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,839
if you're hearing this you're probably

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,159
in the right place

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
so this session is being recorded uh we

15
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,399
have a jab room

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,680
which is mirrored to uh the chat

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,640
in mit echo so if you appear in either

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,159
one it should

19
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,840
should appear there uh we have no

20
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
taking uh

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,039
tim volunteered to be a note taker yes

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,840
yes um but

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,840
if tim anything please go to godamd and

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,200
help him out

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,200
yes i'd appreciate that so

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:27,440
right so um this is our gender

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,160
we basically have uh just split the main

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
demark

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
this document into three parts um so

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,640
this is fairly new

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,200
uh we'll basically discuss

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,720
a set of topics for

33
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
relevant for each part

34
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,799
in case of gmark base there actually

35
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,040
three topics we'll talk about pct

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
possibly breaking out the main

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
organizational domain definition and

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,959
policy discovery

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:07,760
any agenda bashing at this point

40
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
i suspect we probably wouldn't use two

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
hours for this session

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,440
but uh we'll use as much of it as

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
productive

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:30,879
see yes did i hear

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,040
yeah hi hi this is jim fenton um

46
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
i was just looking at the issue tracker

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,599
and you know we've got an

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,119
awful lot of open issues and i guess one

49
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,280
of the things that i was

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
wondering was that you know is there a

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,840
plan to

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,319
do some sort of a an issue scrub at some

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,720
point

54
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,518
yes absolutely we sure um chair should

55
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
get on top of things and

56
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
if we have a resolution for any specific

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:01,040
issue we need to declare it

58
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:03,920
absolutely okay

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
so

60
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,640
um yeah just a very quick working group

61
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,359
status

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,159
i already said there are three documents

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
um

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
we have which are the main focus of the

65
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,679
working group at the moment

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
but because the documents were all

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,120
published so recently

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,400
um for this session there is really no

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,680
expectation that people

70
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
read them i mean it's nice if people did

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,199
but

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,320
i think it's probably too much to ask

73
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
such a short notice

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,198
so

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
let's get started with the first issue

76
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,479
on the list

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,360
um so

78
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,719
it relates to the base document and the

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,080
question is

80
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,280
um should we keep or should we deprecate

81
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
the pct

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,960
tag so

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,960
on the screen is the definition of it

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,440
it's a percentage of messages from

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,479
domains owner mail stream

86
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,080
um and

87
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,000
as pointed out on the next flight

88
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
what exactly is the problem this well

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,360
it's written implemented and understood

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,360
very differently

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,440
some so for implementations you can say

92
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,039
that there might be implementation bugs

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,639
but it's unclear enough and causes

94
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,639
enough

95
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,000
misinterpretation so we should figure

96
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
out what to do with this

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,680
so as written it's applied percentage of

98
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,680
all male

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
but when people implement they think

100
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,199
it's percentage of failing mail which

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,318
are two very different things

102
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
and on top of this there are

103
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,000
implementation issues um

104
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,680
and then of course there are interesting

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
border cases like pct

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
0 and

107
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,720
uh what's what's the meaning of things

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,520
like

109
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,440
p p equal quarantine visibility zero

110
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
does it mean p equal none

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,479
what exactly does it mean

112
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,758
and do actually people implement the

113
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,758
edge cases correctly

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,120
so the question for this group is

115
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,560
do we need it consider that there is p

116
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,560
equal quarantine

117
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:46,080
[Music]

118
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
should we make definition consistent

119
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
we'll discuss

120
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,440
todd you can go ahead yeah regarding the

121
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
um

122
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,360
the perverse incentive of p equal

123
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
quarantine percent equals zero

124
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,520
i don't know if it's true any longer but

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
there was a time

126
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
when if one get wanted to get correct

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
reports out of google especially mail

128
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
that was transiting any sort of google

129
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
groups

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,479
one had to have the p equal quarantine

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,198
percent equals zero

132
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,960
uh as a substitute for p equal none in

133
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
order to get those reports

134
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,758
again they may have fixed this this was

135
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,039
several years ago when this when this

136
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,319
was true but

137
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
that was the reason i think for the

138
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,000
perverse incentive in the first place

139
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,758
in general i'm in favor of getting rid

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
of the percent tag for the reason stated

141
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,319
that it's just probably not implemented

142
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,759
correctly but

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,000
we'll need to make sure that that won't

144
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,720
have any impact on on any reports coming

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
out of google first

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
autumn

147
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
i think i may be one of the stronger

148
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,840
advocate for

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,199
the percent tag particularly due to p

150
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,239
equals quarantine percent equals zero

151
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
as kurt just mentioned one of the

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,840
big perverse incentives is mailing lists

153
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,560
that will munch headers

154
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,359
only if they find an enforcing policy in

155
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,800
place

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,759
that is a big part of why we do this

157
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,919
i work for agari where i help large

158
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
organizations implement dmarc quarantine

159
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,440
and reject all the time

160
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,560
and particularly we see this a lot with

161
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,679
google groups

162
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,080
but also with a couple of mailing list

163
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,159
platforms like groups.io

164
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,479
and listserv by elsoft

165
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,838
will munch headers for domains using a

166
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
quarantine or reject tag

167
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,440
but not using a p equals none or i guess

168
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,079
presumably no

169
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
the market entry at all and the reason

170
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
this is a big deal

171
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
is that some of these large

172
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,279
organizations get to a point where

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,640
everything legitimately sending email

174
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,959
from their domain

175
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,720
has been properly set to be in

176
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,760
compliance with dmarc

177
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,680
and yet they see all of these messages

178
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
primarily through google servers but

179
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,160
also through some of these other mailing

180
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
lists

181
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,279
as failing and i can assure them all day

182
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,080
long that when they go to quarantine or

183
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,760
reject

184
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,839
those messages will no longer show as

185
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
failures but it makes their leadership

186
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
very nervous

187
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,760
and very hesitant to use a restrictive

188
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,719
policy

189
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,959
i've been able to break that resistance

190
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,399
by having them use p equals quarantine

191
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,920
percent equal zero

192
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,160
for a couple weeks and show them that

193
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,199
the things that had looked like failures

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,560
disappear

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,640
and the traffic is fine and in that

196
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,800
in that realm i'm able to get people to

197
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,360
adopt a stricter security setting

198
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,199
whereas without that they are very

199
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
risk-averse and very uncomfortable with

200
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
it

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
so do you think it's uh something that

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,360
we can

203
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
clarify by additional text one way or

204
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,320
the other

205
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,079
so like it's sort of like a special case

206
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,160
pct equals zero and

207
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,279
even if we take pct equal zero epct out

208
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,439
we can still add text explaining that

209
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,880
yes we could do something like allowing

210
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,560
this but not other

211
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,480
other pct equals or allowing some other

212
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,160
setting that accomplishes a similar goal

213
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,360
would be fine now i have had a couple of

214
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,040
organizations that do use uh percentage

215
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
tags in the way that it was intended to

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
be used

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to roll it out slowly but that's only

218
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,240
happened with a couple of my

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,920
customers and i think they were people i

220
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,399
could probably have talked into doing

221
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,640
this

222
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
without that one of the biggest

223
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,079
exceptions to that was

224
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
one of the largest email organizations

225
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,920
that i've worked with

226
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
and that was because they were worried

227
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
that they would get enough

228
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,160
reports back that their upper management

229
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,240
might notice and decide something was

230
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,319
wrong even though nothing was wrong

231
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,440
so they wanted to kind of slowly test

232
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,959
the waters

233
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,040
but i think that is a very

234
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,239
small set of people who are in that

235
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,319
situation

236
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,079
and i do think that most of them could

237
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,040
be convinced to either

238
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,279
go along or just make a a call that they

239
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
weren't going to do it anyways

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,640
so i don't know that the regular

241
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,719
intended use of percentage

242
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,720
is as much of a key requirement

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
thank you allman

244
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,800
hopefully it's connected correctly um

245
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,240
regarding the percentage tag anyway

246
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,839
autumn will also

247
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
mention it from an implementation

248
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,760
perspective

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
from a practical perspective i've only

250
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,000
seen very useful cases when moving from

251
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,519
quarantine to reject in the more a more

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,959
restrictive policy

253
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,079
component in a way to test well or at

254
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,279
least have confidence in

255
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,120
enforcing the policies even more i do

256
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
recognize that in the earlier stages

257
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,200
it's confusing

258
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
from impulsing none or perhaps the

259
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
policy quarantine

260
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,720
quarantine but dropping it to actually

261
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
have a gradual

262
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,760
control of moving from quarantine to

263
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,319
reject

264
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,880
um i might see some some difficult

265
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
issues

266
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,160
when running implementations or at least

267
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,160
helping people implement dmarc

268
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,160
all right thank you

269
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
jim

270
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,800
uh we couldn't hear you i can see you i

271
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
couldn't hear you

272
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
i clicked and it didn't make it through

273
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,639
um

274
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,319
two things i was under the impression

275
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,920
that if you said p equals none and

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,560
specified reports

277
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,920
you would still get reports about the

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
failures that were happening

279
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
and i kind of thought that was the the

280
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,399
same thing as

281
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,160
as saying pct equals zero

282
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,560
if i'm wrong about that please let me

283
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,120
know um the other thing is i'm wondering

284
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,880
if deprecate is the right term here

285
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,480
we're writing a new standards track

286
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,120
specification

287
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,120
uh to replace an informational thing do

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
we need to deprecate anything

289
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,279
um shouldn't we we're not going to do it

290
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,680
don't we just leave pct

291
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
out because this is the first

292
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,160
specification really

293
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,120
yeah i mean you're right it can be it

294
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,600
doesn't have to be

295
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,680
as strong as actually saying not use it

296
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,279
but can just leave it out but

297
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,120
it's still the question is you know if

298
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,240
we live without

299
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
what do we have some wording around

300
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,680
why we did it you know explaining the

301
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
reasoning

302
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
or so yeah

303
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
all right okay and and and i see that

304
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,240
autumn has kind of answered me on the

305
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,839
chat

306
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,079
p equals none with reports you get

307
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,800
reports but not head or munching so

308
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,800
thank you all right

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
okay anybody else

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,160
oh yeah i just uh i'm very sorry i

311
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
wasn't

312
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,680
uh very clear on this

313
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,519
uh obviously all of these discussions

314
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,239
will feed to the main english discussion

315
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,399
so

316
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,160
we cannot really make a decision uh and

317
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,560
declare consensus here

318
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,160
uh both because we don't have enough

319
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,319
people and

320
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
um because this is not how it does

321
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,600
things so

322
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,600
uh

323
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:45,839
yeah so thank you for the comments uh

324
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,839
we'll bring them to the mailing list

325
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,480
right let's move on to the next

326
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
topic then

327
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,240
in regards to aggregate reporting

328
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,439
yes in regards to aggregate reporting um

329
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:18,719
a couple of um general question

330
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,480
one is uh about extensible reporting

331
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,800
what kind of extensibility we should

332
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,839
allow the grammar is quite

333
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,839
restrictive at the moment

334
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:41,839
uh yeah please discuss suggestions uh

335
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,839
thoughts you have on the topic

336
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,639
your head down for them

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,160
but all of the extensible options you

338
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,480
had in mind but

339
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,839
one thing that comes to mind is that

340
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,600
gmail is including

341
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
dchem selectors and their aggregate

342
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,399
reports

343
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,040
but that's not common elsewhere and

344
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,360
i really like it so i'd love to see more

345
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
of that

346
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
sounds good can you propose a change if

347
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,480
it's not

348
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,480
um

349
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,839
sure to be honest i'm not familiar

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,040
enough to say

351
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,440
how i we would do that dave asks why i

352
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,959
like the having the selectors included

353
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,759
well a big part of what i am doing

354
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,680
with dmarc data is helping large

355
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,639
organizations with multiple email

356
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,479
streams

357
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
try to track down those different email

358
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,399
streams so

359
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,839
even if something is fully passing

360
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
authentication

361
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
they don't always the people i'm talking

362
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,720
to are usually a security or i t

363
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,120
team for a large organization maybe a

364
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,600
business maybe a government agency

365
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,039
and a lot of times they have no idea who

366
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,839
the people on the ground are

367
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,400
who are actually sending these emails

368
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,639
and

369
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
maybe they've got that somewhere in

370
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,360
various ticketing

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,799
systems somehow but they don't always

372
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,760
know what to query

373
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,480
so when we have selectors included that

374
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,079
is very helpful for them to be able to

375
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,640
search their records and maybe figure

376
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,799
out who put something in dns

377
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,640
because they're much more likely to have

378
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
a dns record tracked

379
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
to say oh we put in a c name or a text

380
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,799
record

381
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,080
so it facilitates tracking and

382
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,200
similarly it's also helpful to figure

383
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,799
out if

384
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,720
dqm keys have been rotated because

385
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,799
a number of the organizations that use

386
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,600
cnames for dkim

387
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,160
will do automated key rotation where

388
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,799
they might

389
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,320
have you implement three cname records

390
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,679
and they'll switch between them every

391
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,840
few months

392
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,679
but as an outsider if you're not looking

393
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,559
at the mail traffic you've got no idea

394
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,960
which one is live at any given moment

395
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,200
and so that can be nice for people who

396
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,559
have any sort of security requirement to

397
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,679
monitor for

398
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,200
dqm key changes knowing what selector is

399
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,200
currently sending is very helpful

400
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,159
so i would be happy to see that in dmarc

401
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
reports and in terms of how we would

402
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,440
make that extensible

403
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
i would have to go look at exactly what

404
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,960
the aggregate reports look like from

405
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,280
gmail i don't have one handy but

406
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
i believe it just has s equals and then

407
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,960
the selector

408
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,440
in the same list of format like you

409
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
would get

410
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,840
in other people's aggregate reports

411
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,879
right i think

412
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,479
one suggestion was to have more

413
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,039
structured

414
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,640
data in aggregate reports to make them

415
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,320
easier to parse so

416
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,919
if there is something that of use then

417
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,918
you should think about that as well

418
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,840
all right marie

419
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,840
murray would you like to be next

420
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
sorry it wasn't yes now you're hearing

421
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,080
me um yes

422
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,600
um we did rfc 8601 recently to revise

423
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,520
authentication results and part of that

424
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
was to add header.s

425
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,799
in support of doing exactly what we're

426
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
talking about here

427
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
so i think that's one that makes sense

428
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,360
to do i thought it was tracked as a

429
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,799
as an issue um to do that in particular

430
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,479
but so that's the

431
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
that's the most common use case i've

432
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
heard in terms of extending this

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
all right thank you todd

434
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
chad but it is tracked as an issue

435
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,480
murray it's issue 57

436
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
uh make decamp selectors required in

437
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,360
dmarc reports so there is already an

438
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,360
issue for this

439
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,840
all right john

440
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,120
can you hear me my microphone hasn't

441
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,280
been working very well okay

442
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,639
um it's not clear to me what the

443
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,639
question is that we are

444
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,720
trying to address here um is it

445
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,919
what other things do we want people to

446
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
what are they what yeah what other

447
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,159
things

448
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
might we like to have in reports or is

449
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,600
the question is how do we

450
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,240
put um how do we allow people to put

451
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,520
stuff into reports in a way that won't

452
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,880
won't break existing parsers and 7489

453
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,039
has an xml

454
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
grammar which is fine and i suppose we

455
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,039
could put some stuff into the grammar

456
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,639
that says add your add your hacks here

457
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,919
um and i guess you have a right

458
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,600
i think we want both really okay uh

459
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,360
if there are any specific things that

460
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,080
are commonly used add them

461
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,719
right away as well as some text about

462
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,080
where to

463
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,640
stuff your your extensions okay yeah

464
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,240
i mean because i mean i've you know i

465
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
have an xml parsing script

466
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,159
which i i believe does not attempt to

467
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
enforce the grammar so it might be

468
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
yeah i guess just some comments saying

469
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,600
like that might be extra stuff just

470
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,600
ignore it would be a good place to start

471
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,039
right as opposed to just aborting and

472
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,158
yeah throwing everything out

473
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:45,840
yeah okay

474
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:45,840
all right anybody else

475
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,799
okay let's talk

476
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,840
more about aggregate reporting

477
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,840
the two other obvious things that needs

478
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,000
to be done in

479
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,959
in this area is full text from arc

480
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,039
reporting

481
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,360
um if that's uh becomes the way

482
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,360
for dealing with indirect mail flows

483
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,559
um and as well as uh

484
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,559
no such domain reporting

485
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:41,840
if you have comments on these topics

486
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:41,840
please come to the mic

487
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:09,120
sounds like there are no takers on these

488
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:12,240
but uh

489
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,600
okay okay john

490
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,080
go ahead i guess what i said in the chat

491
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,399
is

492
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,840
these both seem reasonable and i would i

493
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,840
guess i would encourage

494
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,320
whoever suggested that they want these

495
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,360
reports to send some snippets of xml so

496
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,799
we can see

497
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,840
because we can try and nail down what it

498
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
is they're reporting because i could

499
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,158
imagine particularly for arc

500
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,320
um a range from yeah they used arc so

501
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,720
here's the entire details of

502
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,960
of all 473 bits of stuff in the arc

503
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
chain

504
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
right

505
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,959
okay let's move on to the next

506
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,440
democratic reporting so

507
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,879
this is at this point is more

508
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,880
experimental um

509
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,480
questions are for this which fields

510
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,559
should and should not be included

511
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
uh one strongman is just a good from

512
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,360
from and two

513
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,600
um is it useful what else people want or

514
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,840
don't want to see there

515
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,840
please come to the mic

516
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
go ahead marie

517
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,600
is the question uh about the straw man

518
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,600
is what

519
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
must be included what may be included i

520
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,158
haven't i'm i haven't read the new

521
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,760
document yet but

522
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
does anybody know what that whether

523
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,960
we're talking about

524
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,880
a minimal set of things that have to be

525
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,720
included or a full list of things that

526
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,400
might be included or some mix of those

527
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,679
both i mean what's the recommended

528
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,080
minimum as well as

529
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,679
a reason to include or not to include

530
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
more

531
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,200
and especially you know obviously

532
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,880
privacy considerations are going to be

533
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
right right quite important for this

534
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
document this is right for our privacy

535
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,080
considerations section yeah

536
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,360
yeah okay thanks

537
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,720
todd yeah i

538
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,080
i don't see him uh on the call but i

539
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
know jesse thompson

540
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
from the university of wisconsin has

541
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,200
spoken in the past about his

542
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,719
sort of straw man failure reporting and

543
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,400
how it would be uh

544
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,520
super helpful for him who's at a large

545
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,679
distributed uh

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,279
system to figure out just just where the

547
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,640
failures are coming from

548
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,520
uh to have that from in the two i

549
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,200
i don't like the idea of the failure

550
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,158
report sentence failures occur that just

551
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,520
seems like a vector

552
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,360
to to be abused um

553
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,679
simply from somebody forging mail and

554
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,240
causing intentional dmarc failures

555
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
but um something stripped down with just

556
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
from and two sent at a regular interval

557
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,039
like an aggregate report sounds

558
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:25,679
reasonable um assuming people would

559
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:29,760
actually consume the reports

560
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,760
all right thank you thought bottom

561
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:38,240
last ietf i sent out a message to

562
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
other folks on my team who also help

563
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,120
people implement dmarc

564
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
and of course everybody loves the full

565
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,158
uh

566
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,120
forensic reports but there are some

567
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
pieces that

568
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,678
we are less in need of so

569
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,678
for example there's

570
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,120
there are some providers that provide

571
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,120
the full message

572
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,039
obviously most of the time we're working

573
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,039
without that that's fine

574
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,360
we also don't usually find ourselves in

575
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,200
need of a full dchem header

576
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,039
which is often in the results

577
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,720
we don't usually need a full date and

578
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,559
time stamp so

579
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,679
a date is good time stamp not

580
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,678
necessarily required

581
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,000
i think my my team most often

582
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,760
that we do use the from address and

583
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,279
also the subject line is really

584
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,080
important to us

585
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,399
now the subject line i think is one that

586
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,399
is

587
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,239
up in the air because of concerns over

588
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,080
private data

589
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,159
but that is extraordinarily helpful

590
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,960
again the use case i'm seeing is a

591
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,000
domain with many distinct email

592
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,080
uses many distinct vendors and

593
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
not a lot of visibility otherwise into

594
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
what's being sent

595
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,719
so if you are a domain that only has a

596
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,240
couple of uses of email

597
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,240
that's usually a little easier to figure

598
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,799
out but i've worked with domains that

599
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,279
had

600
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,879
200 separate accounts and service

601
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
providers sending email

602
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,919
and trying to track down who is

603
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,439
responsible for that can be quite

604
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,480
challenging

605
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,279
so that's why we use those my team

606
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,399
members also

607
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,399
find the message id helpful sometimes

608
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,719
because sometimes it provides insight

609
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,600
into the back end technology

610
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,360
now that's another question i guess what

611
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,080
would be helpful for this is if we could

612
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,279
find

613
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,960
what specific fields people are really

614
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,880
objecting to

615
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,640
because some of them are going to be a

616
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,200
bigger deal than others and i think

617
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,200
there's potential trade-offs to be made

618
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,880
is the concern really over possibly

619
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,799
exposing infrastructure

620
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,720
if that's the case then a message id is

621
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,879
something that should be up in the air

622
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,159
if that's less the case then that's

623
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,159
something that's very helpful

624
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,480
particularly for identifying abusive

625
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
traffic as opposed to legitimate traffic

626
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,200
so i hope that's kind of a helpful set

627
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,480
of pieces

628
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
uh also we do like the dqm selector and

629
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,720
that's

630
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,279
of course something we're suggesting in

631
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,880
aggregate the links of course are also

632
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,240
very helpful but again i know that's

633
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,679
something that people might be

634
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,679
a little bit less comfortable sharing

635
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,399
all right thank you

636
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,480
all then

637
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,959
yeah so partially comment regarding uh

638
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,360
the destruction around the the

639
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
reporting so i think because the subject

640
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,520
is so

641
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,760
pii uh heavily written um a lot of

642
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
implementers actually didn't directly

643
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,559
said well we're not going to touch the

644
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
subject until the privacy issues have

645
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,200
been resolved

646
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,320
um i definitely see real life use cases

647
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,520
for

648
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,520
having in a way abstracted report uh

649
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,720
with uh limited api information

650
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,320
um but then the the the the

651
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,240
headers regarding where the message

652
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,559
originated from

653
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,000
mta wise would be very interesting to

654
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
have in there

655
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,159
do not need the subject to be honest

656
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,439
from a personal perspective but

657
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,679
having at least from the the

658
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
the domain part and then the two-domain

659
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,320
part

660
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,679
without the local parties would be fine

661
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,678
from a specification perspective

662
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:23,840
all right thank you michael

663
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,120
uh yeah so um

664
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
in the past i found the full failure

665
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,199
reports

666
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,320
um which we received as a

667
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,320
contracted party a lot of folks don't

668
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,200
send them publicly

669
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,200
and just to give an example of how

670
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,480
useful they can be

671
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,480
in total

672
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,880
because we had control of our mail flows

673
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,158
um

674
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,039
essentially if we

675
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,159
re if we looked at all of the urals that

676
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,799
we were sending from our own mail

677
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,919
subtracted those from the failure

678
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,039
reports

679
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,600
all that was left was badness and we

680
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,640
actually use those links

681
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,840
uh from the badness for

682
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,159
shutting down the sites that are hosting

683
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,360
uh

684
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,039
malicious activity um

685
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,399
abusive our name

686
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,840
etc etc so it is very useful

687
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,760
in getting rid of the badness it's not

688
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,439
just

689
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,440
arbitrary failures that's all i got

690
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,840
thank you john

691
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,320
i have to say i don't entirely

692
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,760
understand what problem we're trying to

693
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,918
solve here

694
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,879
i mean i'm looking at my folder full of

695
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,519
failure reports

696
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,480
the vast majority of them come from two

697
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
places

698
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,080
probably the same two places everybody

699
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,000
else gets them and what i see

700
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
is that most of the failure reports have

701
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
the have what appears to be the full

702
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
header

703
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,360
and uh one microsoft subsidiary since

704
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,440
the whole thing which is very generous

705
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,039
of them and kind of startling

706
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,200
um and but it seems to me that you know

707
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,879
it's it's a local policy decision of

708
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,240
what privacy issues you have

709
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,399
you know and i think we can come up with

710
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,240
a complicated spec of some sort

711
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,840
but the reality is that most people

712
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,159
won't send failure reports

713
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,678
and the ones that do will redact it to

714
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,360
make their lawyers happy

715
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,279
you know so i don't see a whole lot of

716
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,199
value in

717
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,240
in saying anything any more detail well

718
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,240
you know send you know

719
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,960
send whatever you feel you're able to

720
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,480
send then it would be nice if you said

721
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,600
along you know the from line of the

722
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,799
message header but

723
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,199
you know we'll take we'll take what we

724
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,200
can get

725
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,880
yeah i think um if we want to encourage

726
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,840
more failure reporting then having some

727
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,559
text about

728
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,918
what should be included and what you

729
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,399
should consider at minimum

730
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,840
you know and why you you should or

731
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,000
should not include various things would

732
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,918
be useful probably in the document

733
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,519
yeah well i'm just i'm not sure we are

734
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,720
able we are in a position to say

735
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,480
basically you know we're talking to

736
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,840
lawyers here and i'm not sure there's

737
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,600
anything we can say in the standard that

738
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,360
says oh it's okay to send x

739
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,799
because they'll say you know they have

740
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,439
their own they have their own opinions

741
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,519
about it so

742
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,360
like i'm not opposed to doing this i

743
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,399
just think i don't think we should put a

744
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,840
whole lot of effort into it because i

745
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,918
think in reality

746
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,840
um people are going to report what

747
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,840
they're going to report

748
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,120
so

749
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,200
so kurt in um in the chat was saying

750
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,239
your suggestion sounds like a usage doc

751
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,399
not a spec

752
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:08,480
well um the boundaries sometimes

753
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,480
sort of a bit gray between these two so

754
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,159
right any other question any other

755
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,839
comments on this

756
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,839
if not let's move on

757
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,200
right this might be

758
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,839
an interesting and long discussion or

759
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,839
not we'll see

760
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,639
so we had a discussion starting on the

761
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,760
main that started on the mailing list

762
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,919
about

763
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,040
splitting out or domain to different

764
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:52,078
documents so that

765
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,279
if we revise how the where it is

766
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,760
you know is it psl uh or is it something

767
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,440
else

768
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,440
if we change the mechanism how this is

769
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,440
retrieved um

770
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,880
then we don't wouldn't have to revise

771
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,880
the demark base itself

772
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,320
comments in favor comments against this

773
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,839
let's discuss

774
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,839
yes dave

775
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,839
if you're talking i'm not hearing

776
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,839
anything

777
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
i can see you now i don't hear you this

778
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,240
this probably works better now doesn't

779
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,839
it

780
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:00,959
yes it does yeah you have to click twice

781
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,040
um so since i made a proposal for a

782
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,839
really firm split i'm feeling obligated

783
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,040
to uh

784
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,160
at least repeat that um this is a

785
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,800
messy uh unpleasant topic with a bad

786
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,399
history

787
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,560
um it's a case of making do with

788
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,440
what is generally viewed as a not very

789
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,880
good or

790
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,400
terrible uh solution but it's the best

791
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
that's available now

792
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,280
there are different approaches to making

793
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,400
it a lot better one of these days one of

794
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,960
them might actually

795
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,520
prove successful and and get adopted and

796
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
work better

797
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,680
baking anything into the core uh dmarc

798
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,640
spec

799
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,960
that relies on anything in particular

800
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,040
happening

801
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:50,640
it is is just inherently risky

802
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,520
having the spec state what it wants

803
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,160
as a result what's the nature of the

804
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,800
information

805
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,680
it wants that makes sense because

806
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,960
because

807
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,960
dmarc needs to use that information

808
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,240
making any statements about how it gets

809
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,280
the information

810
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,479
is the problem and i

811
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
i now don't remember who made the

812
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,079
suggestion for

813
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,119
some compromised text i can't remember

814
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,520
whether it was uh

815
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,400
murray or barry or or kurt or whoever

816
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,960
but it was it was very clean it was very

817
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,800
simple

818
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,800
and it seemed to be plenty sufficient

819
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,720
um

820
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,599
if people want to volunteer themselves

821
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,118
on other people

822
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:45,520
for to be editors for this please also

823
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,400
let shares now you don't have to do it

824
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
in a meeting if you

825
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,920
if you're not comfortable but uh

826
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,560
well my my point was some text was

827
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,440
offered it was i think two sentences

828
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,400
and it seemed to me uh complete plenty

829
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,400
sufficient

830
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,320
uh the first sentence said we're not

831
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
specifying it and the second sentence

832
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,640
said

833
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,480
um by the way there's some existing

834
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,000
practice i i don't remember the exact

835
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,119
language now but it was

836
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,800
it was along those lines and the

837
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,640
important part was

838
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,599
it wasn't normative and it wasn't

839
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,480
technical detail

840
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,480
all right thank you

841
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,399
john

842
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,240
i'm going to shock you all and almost

843
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
agree with dave i mean on the mainland

844
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,240
first i was saying no we shouldn't do

845
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,799
this

846
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,520
and now i think we should i just want to

847
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,079
make sure

848
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,920
that we agree that when we split this

849
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,599
out into another document

850
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,119
it is possible that what we end up

851
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
specifying as

852
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,119
as the org domain will not necessarily

853
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,000
be the same domain that the current

854
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,440
process finds

855
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,040
and in particular if we do a t if we do

856
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,720
a tree walk it won't be

857
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,240
i mean i'm fine with that i just want to

858
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,200
if we're going to do this i just want

859
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,399
i think we need to make sure that

860
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,040
everybody understands that that's what

861
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,040
that's where this could lead

862
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,800
right and this nicely leads to the

863
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,240
next set of discussions we're going to

864
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,240
have murray

865
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,040
um john's right of course my thought

866
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
would

867
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,079
would be that we produce um an org

868
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,400
domain

869
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,079
document that just is basically a

870
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,960
transplant of the

871
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,680
current psl text from 7489 into

872
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,000
something and that's the thing that

873
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,359
uh my proposed text referred to as this

874
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
is the legacy thing everybody's been

875
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,240
using for a while but you can use other

876
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,839
things as they appear

877
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,359
and then we might immediately generate

878
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,880
another one that says here's how you do

879
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,720
it with the tree walk

880
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,320
you could put those two in a common

881
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,078
document how you organize that is really

882
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,599
not important i don't think but i think

883
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,160
it's going to be important to preserve

884
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,520
what was there but very clearly label it

885
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,879
as this is what we came up with

886
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,000
originally we don't love it it served a

887
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
purpose for a while

888
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,599
um watch for better things and then the

889
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,040
tree walk might be

890
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:10,000
might follow on right immediately and

891
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:12,240
that might be the preferred thing

892
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,240
right

893
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,440
yeah is it coming through yes um i think

894
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,880
what experience to talk about the policy

895
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,839
discovery

896
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,680
first uh before we worry about whether

897
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,640
or not an organizational demand is even

898
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,919
relevant

899
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,200
because talking about splitting out a

900
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,280
subspec

901
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,799
of how to find an organizational domain

902
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
when we potentially don't even care

903
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,599
about an

904
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,799
organizational domain because it's now

905
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,160
obsolete

906
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,480
seems like getting the cart before the

907
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,480
horse

908
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,280
there is that but i think uh

909
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,319
it sort of goes back to murray or

910
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,480
somebody's point that once we split it

911
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,839
off it might mutate into something else

912
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,839
so yes these two issues are completely

913
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,839
interlinked

914
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,400
all right well and i also don't think

915
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,680
that it makes sense to have

916
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,560
a separate document that says

917
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,399
essentially thanks for looking here

918
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,440
about finding an org domain but we don't

919
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,599
care anymore because

920
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,599
do a tree walk instead and that so i

921
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,280
think we'd be better served as just an

922
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,040
appendix and a new document that says

923
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,040
historically here's how it's done

924
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,839
this is the way going forward and not

925
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,839
have a separate document

926
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,040
potentially so i'm i'm on the fence

927
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,040
about a separate document per se

928
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,000
right

929
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,000
any other comments

930
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,480
well if not lan then let's talk about

931
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,839
tree walk

932
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,879
so yeah there um as already pointed out

933
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,240
on the mending this this solve

934
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,760
some um existing use cases

935
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,759
um like nested organizations

936
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,280
governments universities as well as

937
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,400
top-level domains which are

938
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,400
currently explicitly prohibited so

939
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,440
please come to the mic and let's discuss

940
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,440
autumn

941
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
the nested organizations piece that you

942
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,160
mentioned

943
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,200
so i've seen this a lot in

944
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,440
higher education and sadly jessie's not

945
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,078
here to join us but

946
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,880
this is a big issue that i see in almost

947
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,280
every university i've worked with

948
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,000
for a while i was working on a dmarc

949
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,640
policy

950
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,640
with an organization that was a

951
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,040
particular grad school

952
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,680
and the grad school was part of a much

953
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,800
larger

954
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,680
university and so their

955
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,839
primary domain was effectively

956
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,359
grad.university.edu and then they had

957
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,640
multiple sub-sub-domains of

958
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:33,119
you know english.grad.university.edu

959
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:36,879
and tech.grad.university.edu

960
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,560
and for all of those they really had

961
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,480
wanted to be able to have

962
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,520
a policy at grad.university.edu

963
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,800
that could handle reporting for example

964
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,960
for every possible sub sub domain out of

965
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,240
what was their organization's primary

966
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,440
domain it just

967
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,359
happened to be a sub-domain of

968
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:00,319
you know university.edu and

969
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:03,440
university.edu itself

970
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,400
was not interested in implementing dmarc

971
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,079
so i don't know how often this use case

972
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,119
occurs but i do see it a lot

973
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,000
with higher education and government as

974
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,079
well

975
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,240
and that's where i think folks would be

976
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,560
really happy to have something like this

977
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,479
now i can see where there could be a lot

978
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,560
of downsides to performing

979
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,800
effectively an infinite tree walk i mean

980
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,839
how many levels out are we going to go

981
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,640
before it

982
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,279
causes serious load issues or what have

983
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,680
you

984
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,200
but even allowing for one or two

985
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,680
additional levels would be

986
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,078
very helpful even just one i think would

987
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,319
make a big difference

988
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
yeah i think that some of the proposals

989
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,079
were to limit

990
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,200
how many you will do and uh we'll

991
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,560
obviously need to

992
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,560
figure out what the number is

993
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,760
right thank you uh john

994
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,839
yeah i went over and asked our friends

995
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,839
in dns land

996
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,839
how much do they hate tree walks because

997
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:08,319
they mean it used to be a total

998
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,839
a total killer and the response i got

999
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,240
was like oh yeah whatever

1000
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,078
would you rather surprise me and they

1001
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
pointed out that the caa

1002
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,800
dns record that's used for for

1003
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,799
controlling um

1004
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,200
um tls certificate issuance has

1005
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,280
specified a tree walk for seven years it

1006
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,799
was published in 2013

1007
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,640
and i can tell you from experience

1008
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,359
arguing with with certificate

1009
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,319
authorities that they actually do that

1010
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,520
so i think if we you know and and people

1011
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,040
said you know and they said yeah you can

1012
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,640
do 100 level thing you know and i said

1013
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,720
well you know who has ever had

1014
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,480
an actual useful domain more than maybe

1015
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,759
five levels down you know or maybe 10

1016
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,000
levels down

1017
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,520
so you know and everybody seemed to say

1018
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,720
yeah you know it's like okay do a tree

1019
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,319
walk and if you're worried about it

1020
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,680
limited to five levels and then they had

1021
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,440
a couple of other little

1022
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,598
implement implementation tricks you

1023
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,839
might do to take advantage of the fact

1024
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,960
that if your dns cache sees an nx domain

1025
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,720
at a certain level

1026
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,160
then it can automatically tell you

1027
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,919
without going back to the authoritative

1028
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,680
one there's nothing below it

1029
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,440
so i mean from an implementation point

1030
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,480
of view you know and if you um

1031
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,480
you know i i say do a tree walk for do a

1032
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,839
tree walk for five levels until

1033
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,359
and tell people if you want to have more

1034
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,400
than if you want to have stuff more than

1035
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,240
five levels deep

1036
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,839
and get dmarc reports then you better

1037
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,598
put you know

1038
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,839
a dmarc record at least every at least

1039
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,240
35 levels and i think we're done

1040
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:29,119
i mean and the only the only issue here

1041
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,240
is

1042
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,400
sort of mean you know i take autumn's

1043
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,399
point of view of the universities that i

1044
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,680
refer to as the holy roman empire model

1045
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,400
of governance

1046
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,759
and that they have there's you know and

1047
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,119
you basically you cannot tell from the

1048
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,240
structure of their dns tree who's in

1049
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,640
charge of what

1050
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,598
and the flip side is their organizations

1051
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,520
where by golly

1052
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,800
you know the regis their second level

1053
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,079
domain that they registered is their

1054
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
domain and that's where all the reports

1055
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,319
should go

1056
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,000
i mean i don't know if they're people

1057
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:56,319
who feel really strongly about this you

1058
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,400
know

1059
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,839
and that would be an argument for

1060
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,119
keeping something like the current

1061
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,200
organizational domain although the

1062
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,880
counter counter argument is like well

1063
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,799
then woke up and what you know if if

1064
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,000
that is a problem for you then

1065
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,920
write a little script that walks up and

1066
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,280
down your dns tree looking for rogue

1067
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,280
dmarc records and fix them

1068
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,680
jim

1069
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:26,480
hi um so i have to say that i'm i'm

1070
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,680
rather amused by the

1071
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,559
uh idea of doing a tree walk here

1072
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,919
because

1073
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,280
we discussed it extensively

1074
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,520
when we were doing adsp and the

1075
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,680
uh you know it was just like well no you

1076
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,599
can't possibly do a tree walk it was

1077
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,118
it was considered it was it was really

1078
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,400
toxic at the time

1079
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,800
and i have to say i mean my recollection

1080
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,480
is that the objections to it didn't come

1081
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,240
from the dns folks it came from the

1082
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,520
people that are in this meeting

1083
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,439
anyhow um i you know i

1084
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,200
i still think the tree walk is a

1085
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,720
reasonable solution if it's limited i

1086
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,439
don't think it needs to be very many

1087
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,480
levels

1088
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,119
i don't think it's going to create a

1089
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,160
i don't think it's going to create a a

1090
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,599
heavy load

1091
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,000
but one thing that you do want to make

1092
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,400
sure that you have is that the the

1093
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,359
the record that you get to with the tree

1094
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,440
walk

1095
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,880
needs to have a flag in it to indicate

1096
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,720
whether it's intended to

1097
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,920
apply to lower layers because otherwise

1098
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,359
you know you might you might want to

1099
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,480
have a lower layer that doesn't have a

1100
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,720
policy

1101
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,160
or doesn't have a dmarc record and a

1102
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,879
higher layer that does

1103
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,680
and you don't want to essentially have

1104
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,000
including the tree walk

1105
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,000
make that happen unintentionally

1106
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:49,839
thank you jim west

1107
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,440
so not a dmarc expert do know a little

1108
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,079
bit about dns on the other hand so

1109
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,599
um a couple of things and i i don't i'm

1110
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,160
not even sure i have an opinion on

1111
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,760
walking

1112
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,598
myself or not i think if you asked a lot

1113
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,400
of people you'd get you know a bunch of

1114
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,480
different answers

1115
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000
in fact if you ask 10 people you get 11

1116
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,000
answers i'm sure but

1117
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,119
uh as to whether it's actually you know

1118
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,359
good or bad

1119
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,800
i will point out a couple of things one

1120
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,440
the caa example

1121
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,640
is is one where they where it's done but

1122
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,280
there's a huge amount of difference

1123
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,598
between

1124
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,599
the queries that will be generated by

1125
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,839
caa searches which are rare

1126
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,440
versus those you know by mail servers

1127
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,880
actually doing dmarc there's

1128
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,200
there's a significant difference in

1129
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,800
traffic so um

1130
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,558
you know q name minimization is actually

1131
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,920
another way we're actually increasing

1132
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,160
the load on the dns by

1133
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,319
uh by making more requests and that's

1134
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,440
sort of a tree walk going downward

1135
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,558
um ideally the right thing to do

1136
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,160
is provide guidance at that point and so

1137
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,800
if you have a lot of different

1138
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,960
um you know subdivisions within a

1139
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,640
university for example i'm i'm at one so

1140
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,240
i'm just as equally as guilty right we

1141
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,200
have a sub department that that you know

1142
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,200
is inside of the

1143
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,960
major one it'd be better if you could

1144
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,640
add a reference right

1145
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,800
to to be able to say and that reference

1146
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,558
could be you know uh even possibly just

1147
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,119
a cname would work of

1148
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,640
i need my sub department to actually i

1149
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,319
want you to go follow this policy

1150
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,160
somewhere else um

1151
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,160
and that way you know you don't have to

1152
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,399
do a walk if you can point directly at

1153
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,000
it

1154
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,960
right you take out that's a much more

1155
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,200
optimized solution in terms of both

1156
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,480
um you know the number of dns requests

1157
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,680
required as well as just

1158
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:31,200
simplicity of an algorithm so

1159
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:41,839
i think that's all of my points thanks

1160
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:41,839
thank you wes

1161
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:51,118
any other comments um

1162
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:55,839
anybody who wants to maybe have a strong

1163
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,839
feelings against dns work

1164
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:22,480
right it doesn't look like we have any

1165
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:27,680
takers

1166
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,680
and this was the last slide so um

1167
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:37,839
are there any other topics that people

1168
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,839
would like to discuss in this meeting

1169
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,400
sorry the interfaces are is a bit you

1170
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:59,839
know it's hard to

1171
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,839
for me to switch between uh

1172
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:05,839
chat and uh

1173
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,680
seeing who wants to talk

1174
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,440
so it doesn't look like anybody wants to

1175
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,839
come to the mic

1176
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,839
and bring up any other topics

1177
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:36,078
so in this case let's wrap it up

1178
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,240
i hope this was useful i certainly

1179
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:42,079
learned a few things

1180
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,078
we should have good notes and

1181
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,319
we'll take discussions to the mailing

1182
00:52:44,839 --> 00:53:01,839
list

1183
00:52:46,319 --> 00:53:01,839
thank you all for coming

1184
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,880
you
