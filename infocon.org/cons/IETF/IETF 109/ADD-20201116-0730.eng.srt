1
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,000
hello all

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,119
it is the official start time of the

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
meeting however

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,720
glenn our our lead chair for

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
uh shepherding this is currently having

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,840
audio issues so he's trying to sort that

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
out and we'll get going in a little bit

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
in the meantime while he's working on

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,199
this if anybody is eager to

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:13,840
jump up and take the role of note taker

11
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:13,840
we'd love to hear from you

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
this is barbara i can help with notes

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,840
thank you so much barbara uh though

14
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,840
you can use the kodi uh of course

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
but of course

16
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,839
oh oh

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,719
we hear glenn now awesome

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
that's progress i can now hear you and

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,878
you can hear me

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,000
excellent one second with the slides end

21
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,000
i had to do a reboot

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
i had suggested to glenn in chat have

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,000
you tried turning it off and back on

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,840
again

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
so the it still works

26
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,120
all right one more second here

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,640
are you ready sorry about that

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:51,840
i logged in i couldn't hear audio i

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:51,839
couldn't send audio

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,560
i'll mention also that while glenn is

31
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,239
still doing this if anybody is not

32
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
microphone enabled and would like to

33
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,000
bring something to the mic

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
um it's easy enough for me to just jab

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
rescribe without having to

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,399
find another um volunteer to do it so

37
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,000
i'll keep an eye on chat and if you

38
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
preface your line with mike

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
i will know that this is something you

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,239
want said

41
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,840
uh to the group all right

42
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,000
can everyone see the slides at this

43
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,840
point

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
yes all right then shall we get started

45
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,720
sir

46
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,640
please do okay welcome everybody to

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,760
80d at session number one at itf 109.

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,760
uh as you're aware all like if sessions

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,560
are covered by notewell so

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,560
we are as well

51
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
uh we have a pretty simple agenda today

52
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,480
but i think it's gonna fill

53
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,120
the hour very nicely

54
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,040
we have the blue sheets which i guess

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
are now automatic

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,840
we have scribe selection which sounds

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
like it's been taken care of we've

58
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
displayed note well

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,358
the agenda bash i'll do in a second

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,759
but we essentially have a presentation

61
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:24,320
to start off with by tommy pauley

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,680
who has a a 0-0 draft to go over

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,280
there's a bunch of material in this

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
zero-zero draft which will talk about

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
the concept of equivalent resolvers

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,159
which is something that

67
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,198
was introduced by draft box add

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
requirements

69
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
uh so what we'll do is we'll do the

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,840
presentation by tommy

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,680
and then we're do some basic questions

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
but the meat of it this concept of

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
equivalent

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,159
resolvers will have as a separate

75
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
discussion after that draft is presented

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
uh and that will probably take most of

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
the hour

78
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
uh and then we'll have a very quick at

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
the very end five minutes probably not

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,599
even that uh quick discussion about

81
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,120
session number two

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
which is a two hour session scheduled

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,320
for this coming friday

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
so i'll open up any any additions or

85
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,320
changes to this

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,320
uh or removals changes to this draft

87
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
agenda

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
okay moving on

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,919
so uh i'm glendeen when your co-chairs

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,080
and david lawrence is my

91
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,719
other co-chair of add and our area

92
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,359
director is barry liba

93
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
tommy are you on the line

94
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,520
you're immunity tommy all right i think

95
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
the audio just takes a while to connect

96
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,198
can you hear me now

97
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,759
oh we can let me switch over to your

98
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,759
slides

99
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,800
give me one second here i had this all

100
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,880
nicely set up before i did the reboot

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
and of course the reboot threw it all

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
away

103
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,758
all right there's your slides let me

104
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,919
know when you want me to go to the next

105
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,560
slide and i'll just hit sit back and

106
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,318
you're in the driver's seat tommy sounds

107
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,720
good thank you

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,720
all right so what i'll be sharing today

109
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,759
is a

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,080
a simplified proposal that

111
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,360
um some of us the authors listed here on

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,039
the slide

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
have worked on since our previous

114
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
interim meeting and

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,400
we've called this uh

116
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
proposal dear the discovery of

117
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,719
equivalent

118
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,840
encrypted resolvers and this is largely

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
um

120
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,679
reflecting the scope that the working

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,319
group seemed to want to take

122
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
based on our interim meeting discussions

123
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
of

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,440
saying let's just have a very simple use

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,479
case in which we want to

126
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,759
discover the actually equivalent

127
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:12,639
encrypted resolver for a network um

128
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,639
given that i already know an address um

129
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,840
as the chair is mentioned we'll need to

130
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
go into more

131
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,359
details on what equivalent really means

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,239
and what are the guarantees we get from

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,639
that

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
does it actually give you any security

135
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,960
properties or any

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,919
trust properties or not but this

137
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,479
proposal

138
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,599
hopefully can give some concrete details

139
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,919
that help us think about

140
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,360
one way that this discovery mechanism

141
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,359
can work next slide please

142
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,479
all right so what are equivalent

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,160
resolvers and

144
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,318
that's again something that needs to be

145
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,000
discussed the way that we

146
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:58,240
initially defined it here um

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,560
we essentially had two options

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
and we talk about how to address both

149
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
one is when

150
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
there's a very simple case in which i

151
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,039
have another dns

152
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,359
protocol that's available on the same

153
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,120
ip address on the same server so this is

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
saying i

155
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
got provisioned a particular ip address

156
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,160
and i

157
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,800
can speak dns over tls to it but i can

158
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,680
also speak dns over https

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
there's some degree to which this may be

160
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
viewed

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,879
as equivalent a stronger

162
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
version of this that's authenticated is

163
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,719
when we can have some certificate

164
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,279
that claims ownership over both of these

165
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,880
such that i could actually have two

166
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,919
different ip addresses

167
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,760
for my resolvers but have some level

168
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,640
of proof that these are related or

169
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,839
managed by the same entity

170
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
next slide

171
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,560
all right so in this draft we define

172
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
two different use cases that we're

173
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,359
trying to enable discovery of

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,399
encrypted resolvers for the first case

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
is when

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,279
you already have an ip address

177
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,480
of a resolver generally a unencrypted

178
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:24,240
dns overport 53 resolver

179
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,279
and you want to discover what

180
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,959
is the one or multiple

181
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,279
equivalent encrypted resolvers i can

182
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,959
access for this um

183
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
and this address could come from

184
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,239
a network provisioning protocol or be

185
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,079
typed in manually it could just be

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,000
essentially saying

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,440
i am aware of 8.8.8.8

188
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,240
but i don't know if it supports

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
dot or do or how to get to those tell me

190
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,760
about those

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,760
pieces of information the other use case

192
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,000
is one in which you already know the

193
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,560
name of an encrypted resolver but you

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,040
want to

195
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,719
discover the properties of that resolver

196
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
like what are the

197
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,800
port or the url path for dough that you

198
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,199
need to access

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,560
and essentially what are the lists of

200
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,560
the different protocols that it does

201
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,000
support

202
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,920
one thing that we specifically do not

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,800
cover is any type of

204
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,000
discovery of non-equivalent encrypted

205
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,120
resolvers

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,640
such as some upstream resolver that may

207
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
not be able to be

208
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
covered by a common certificate or share

209
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,079
an ip address

210
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,079
next slide please

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,560
so the mechanism that we just we

212
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,680
discussed using for discovery

213
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,079
is based on a draft that ben schwartz

214
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,839
wrote

215
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,120
up for describing

216
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,399
the properties of a dns resolver

217
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,320
in a dns record itself so

218
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,440
he wrote up how to use a service binding

219
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,320
record an svcb record

220
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,720
to list out essentially alternative

221
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,120
services that a resolver offers

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,000
so in this case we can have a dns

223
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
server for example.net and we can get

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,360
different records

225
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,319
one that indicates that it supports do

226
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,160
using

227
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,920
http 2 and has a specific

228
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,519
uri template and then i can also have

229
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
an indication in another record that

230
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
says it also supports dot

231
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,720
and maybe it has an alternative hostname

232
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,480
that it's using.example.net

233
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,880
and it has a specific port it's running

234
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,839
on and this can be expanded to support

235
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,320
dns over quick or any other future

236
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,800
protocol

237
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
we're kind of relying that on that as a

238
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,920
separate

239
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,680
document and really just talking about

240
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,800
how to apply it

241
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,800
for a discovery use case next slide

242
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
please

243
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
so for the first use case when we have

244
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
an ip address and we essentially just

245
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,040
want to

246
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,040
upgrade from unencrypted dns to

247
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,040
encrypted dns

248
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,480
the ip address as i mentioned before can

249
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
be provisioned a number of different

250
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,959
ways

251
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,439
it can come from the network such as

252
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,319
over dhcp or ras

253
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,720
it can come from a vpn protocol it can

254
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,760
be entered manually by the user

255
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,680
each of these different use cases of

256
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,120
these different provisioning mechanisms

257
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,399
has different trust properties

258
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,600
um maybe maybe you trust

259
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,079
dhcp and ra um maybe you have

260
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
ra guard on your network but there's not

261
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,719
a lot of

262
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
user trust in who really is this that's

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,920
provisioning that information

264
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,399
oftentimes a vpn or a

265
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,000
user entered value may be different and

266
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,480
that may be something that we have more

267
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
trust in and so some of the guarantees

268
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,680
that we get from

269
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,160
upgrading discovery could be stronger

270
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,880
for this approach the draft defines

271
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,719
sending

272
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,880
a query for a special use domain name

273
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,279
it proposes result reserving something

274
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,079
like resolver.arpa so that you do a

275
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,760
query for

276
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:19,199
dnsresolver.arpa

277
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,240
and you can get from

278
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
so you send that query to the address of

279
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
your

280
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,040
normal dns over 53 server

281
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,360
so i can send a query to quad 8 let's

282
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,639
say for this special use domain name

283
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,079
and it could send me in the response

284
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,000
one or more answers for equivalent

285
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,479
resolvers which will present

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,079
the different protocols that this

287
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,839
resolver supports

288
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,839
next slide please

289
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,199
for this case we discussed two different

290
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,800
modes in which you can do it

291
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,560
there is um what i think would be the

292
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,599
preferred mode which is to have it

293
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,119
be an authenticated upgrade

294
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,279
and you know what are we trying to

295
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
authenticate here in this case

296
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,800
we are saying that the certificate of

297
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,040
the encrypted resolver

298
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
that we end up connecting to must

299
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,959
include

300
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,000
the original ip address that we knew

301
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,439
about

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,480
quad 8 or whatever else it is in its

303
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,279
um subject alternative name list along

304
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,040
with

305
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,040
the name of the resolver itself

306
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,279
and this mode should absolutely be

307
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,239
required

308
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,439
if the ipaddress is different because

309
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,079
otherwise we have

310
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,160
no way to prevent a number of attacks

311
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,120
that would allow an attacker to divert

312
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,120
encrypted dns tracker to the traffic to

313
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,760
themselves

314
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,720
it also came up on the list um in the

315
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
discussion with

316
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,959
ecker that you could also require the

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,439
san to

318
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,040
cover the ip address of the encryptive

319
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,720
resolver itself

320
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
that's something that we had discussed

321
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,000
and thought about before

322
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,599
but we're not sure about the threat

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,399
model and if that's something that we

324
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
needed to cover

325
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
but that's something i think we should

326
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
discuss

327
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
the other mode is an opportunistic mode

328
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,439
in which

329
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,880
um you aren't able to cover

330
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
anything or validate anything in the

331
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
certificate itself

332
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,560
the draft recommends that this mode only

333
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,639
be used when the ip address

334
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,719
of the encrypted resolver is identical

335
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,759
to the one of the unencrypted resolver

336
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,959
um so that essentially it is as far as

337
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,399
you know the same entity that you're

338
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,758
talking to

339
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,560
um this is a you know

340
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,320
i want to use encrypted dns because i

341
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
think it's better than nothing

342
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
but it's not proving anything about how

343
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,479
much you should trust

344
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,759
that entity other than saying it looks

345
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
like the same person you would have been

346
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
talking to anyway

347
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,839
next slide please

348
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,720
so the other use case is discovery using

349
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,279
a known name

350
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,519
you may already know a resolver name in

351
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,199
for a couple different reasons

352
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,480
one we may be defining new mechanisms

353
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,399
to provision a resolver name

354
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
you could add the name of the resolver

355
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,480
to dhcp

356
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,199
ras it could be in a pvd it could be in

357
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,639
a vpn

358
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,279
configuration item if we go down this

359
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
road

360
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,880
this allows us to not put all of the

361
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,720
details

362
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,480
about do and dot or dns over

363
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,759
quick into dhcp options directly but

364
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,079
only have them

365
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,199
define the name of the resolver and then

366
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,920
use

367
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,680
further dns queries to enumerate all the

368
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,479
dns details

369
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,880
afterwards the name could also be

370
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,519
something that's entered manually

371
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,240
being able to enter a resolver name may

372
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,839
be simpler than having a user type in

373
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,560
a uh full doe uri template

374
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,399
um it's also an interesting use case if

375
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,920
you have

376
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
an encrypted resolver that you know

377
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,599
about but you can't access it so maybe

378
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,640
the ports

379
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,198
for dot are blocked but you want to

380
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,720
discover

381
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,240
if there's an equivalent do resolver um

382
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,039
when you only had dot configured before

383
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,039
next slide please

384
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,160
so in this case we don't use the special

385
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,039
use domain name

386
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
but instead we can simply do a query for

387
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,640
the resolver name

388
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
that we already knew about so this is

389
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,000
really just using

390
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,520
uh benchworth's document kind of as is

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but explaining kind of how it's used in

392
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,240
this deployment

393
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
and in this case the certificate must

394
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
cover the originally known name

395
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,440
um in general that's going to be the

396
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,000
same thing but it's possible that

397
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
let's say a dot server has a slightly

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,440
different name

399
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,480
than the dos server any certificate

400
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,120
would need to cover

401
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,240
both to prove that it's really the same

402
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
equivalent resolver that you're

403
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,640
accessing

404
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,639
next slide please

405
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,918
so that's the proposal

406
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,679
at hand if there are any questions about

407
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,679
the mechanism i'd like to hear that and

408
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
other than that i think

409
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,000
this can be a good starting place for

410
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,000
our discussion about equivalency

411
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,600
yeah so the one thing i'd ask is for

412
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
people to keep their

413
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,480
questions focused on everything except

414
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,678
for the concept of basic equivalency

415
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,679
that we're going to have an extended

416
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
discussion after this

417
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,600
so

418
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
please

419
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,840
uh hang on

420
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,320
uh yes i am managing the queue

421
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,200
but i don't have the buttons at the

422
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,039
moment that are oh i just

423
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
you just have to tell them to unmute

424
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,679
themselves you just call them up and

425
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,840
they'll unmute themselves

426
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,280
okay well that that was it then eric

427
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,760
please

428
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,760
ekr

429
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,280
yeah um so thinking about this

430
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,080
uh name version as opposed to ip version

431
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,520
uh it seems like it has the same problem

432
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,399
that i mentioned with best of the ip

433
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,879
version

434
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
but it's not fixed by the same fix which

435
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,000
is to say

436
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,439
that if you don't trust the resolution

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
of that name

438
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
then the attacker can redirect

439
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,000
themselves through you who can read

440
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
after you through themselves

441
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,320
um thus controlling your source ip

442
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,320
address is that correct

443
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:56,080
okay so let's say i know

444
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,360
well okay so i i know like a dns.google

445
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,520
for dot i learn about it's dope

446
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,039
properties i connect to

447
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,960
dns.google with dough now i

448
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,879
in that case it sounds like that's an

449
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,559
attack that could happen

450
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
regardless of the discovery mechanism

451
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,120
that just

452
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,720
trying to reach out to

453
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,918
the dns server by name the encrypted dns

454
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,360
server by name has that problem

455
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,880
regardless of

456
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,879
any extra discovery if it wasn't already

457
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
with a hard-coded ip address yeah i

458
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,360
think that's correct

459
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,760
um yeah

460
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,080
yeah so i think that's just kind of a

461
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,600
more general property of

462
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,158
not kind of having a hard-coded

463
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,840
address along with your encrypted

464
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
resolver name

465
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,039
okay thank you martin thompson please

466
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,880
it takes a little while isn't it uh so

467
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,840
i'm

468
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,000
i'm really not very clear on why you

469
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,918
have multiple reference identities

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
when you or when you seem to have a

471
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,280
clear reference identity so if you've

472
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,879
discovered something

473
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,720
through for instance dhcp and

474
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,240
the um dhcp is giving you an ip address

475
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,799
then you look for an ip address and

476
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,400
right and that's all you need if you've

477
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,400
got dns.google

478
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,559
then you look for dns.google in the

479
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,919
certificate and that's all you need

480
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,280
the draft seemed to say something about

481
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,919
multiple reference identities and that

482
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,320
was very

483
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,320
confusing um

484
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,799
you can talk about having extra names or

485
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,240
something and there was an extra name

486
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,360
that you would get through

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,559
the service b record for instance and

488
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,760
then you would validate that

489
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,760
as well as the ip address

490
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,720
oh i see so right in this case

491
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,720
you would be

492
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,360
let's say yeah you the dcp gives you

493
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,039
quad 8

494
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,039
um you look up quad 8 and it says

495
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:17,840
i have a do resolver which is dns.google

496
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,919
dns query uh i think it's just

497
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,639
kind of by default your sound should

498
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,360
cover the name that's in the uri

499
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,960
like if if the uri you're accessing has

500
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,399
a name in it

501
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,840
you're validating that anyway and in

502
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,280
addition you should validate the ip

503
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,158
address i think

504
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,799
maybe we should kind of clarify the

505
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
language

506
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,559
please yeah that's all i was trying to

507
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,840
say

508
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,840
okay yep

509
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:58,240
thank you martin rob labor please

510
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,240
ralph is sharing his screen

511
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
here it's the wrong button

512
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,280
still need audio

513
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,640
yeah we see you

514
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,559
you need to click on the audio button

515
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,360
people hear me now all right now we can

516
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,399
yes yep

517
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,479
okay great sorry let me check it so

518
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
um the first question is i mean we are

519
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,400
you're talking about the discovery of a

520
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,840
resolver but it is often the case in

521
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,600
today's world that

522
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
people have configured more than one

523
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
resolver and

524
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,720
one might be upgradable and the other

525
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,639
not

526
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
is there any uh i mean how do you want

527
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,679
to handle that that case

528
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,440
and the second question is the uh

529
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:46,480
i mean private ip addresses we we can't

530
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,400
kind of have certificates about um but

531
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,440
it is a very common use case

532
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,480
now if i read the draft correct it is

533
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,919
kind of okay for it to just do kind of

534
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,360
for instance dot 853 without checking

535
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,840
the ip address

536
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,918
is that correct on my how i understand

537
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,918
it

538
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
to your first question um about multiple

539
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,760
i

540
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,120
i think that goes more into

541
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,760
how the client would end up using this

542
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,918
information

543
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,200
in presence of having something

544
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,640
upgradable so i'm not

545
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,840
we don't get into that here i'm not sure

546
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
if we should get into that we're just

547
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,520
talking about the mechanism

548
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,799
and for the private ipa address space

549
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,600
the kind of one thing we allow for

550
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,879
in that is the opportunistic mode which

551
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,480
says

552
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,360
if you can if you manage to host

553
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,600
the same resolver on the the encrypted

554
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,840
resolver on the same ip address

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,279
that's okay but beyond that um

556
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,080
we'll need a new um

557
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,159
a new mechanism and i think and there

558
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,918
there is no checking i mean

559
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,520
because don't i'm not sure what you

560
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,159
could actually check there because

561
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,600
it's a private ip address supposedly

562
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,840
exactly

563
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,879
yeah there's not much to check and i

564
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,240
think there are two

565
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,159
ways forward for networks that have um

566
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,840
like a resolver forwarder that's on a

567
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,320
private iphone either

568
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,600
they figure out how to host some

569
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,200
encrypted dns on that

570
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,039
or we add in something like a name

571
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,960
into dhcp or ra that will

572
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,039
say here's the name of the alternate

573
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,760
encrypted dns server that you can go out

574
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,760
and reach to

575
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
okay

576
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,799
thank you very much ben schwartz

577
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,959
hi uh so i wanted to talk about

578
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,320
ecker interesting observation that

579
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,480
uh an attacker in the network could

580
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,678
redirect your encrypted stream in order

581
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,159
to

582
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
uh in order to make your apparent client

583
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,840
ip

584
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,840
different from the vantage point of

585
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,120
the server that you're talking to even

586
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,678
if you have an authenticated

587
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,399
connection to the server so i think

588
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,760
that's

589
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
that's an interesting and novel

590
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,960
observation

591
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,000
but i think that we should declare it

592
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,600
out of scope and my reasoning is that

593
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,960
client ips are not validated in tls

594
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,480
so that's a security property of the

595
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,960
secure transport that https inherits for

596
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,640
example

597
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,520
the whole web has the same problem

598
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,720
and dns over tls inherits because it

599
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,279
uses tls and dns for htdps inherits

600
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,880
so uh i think we should just say that

601
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,400
that's out of scope and if we

602
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,400
do want to come up with security

603
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,799
protocols that can

604
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
prove the client ip from the vantage

605
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,960
point of the server

606
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
or something like that then um we should

607
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,760
come back to that

608
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:05,919
later uh i wanted to

609
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,679
um agree with martin thompson

610
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,480
let's not turn the service b target name

611
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,360
into a reference identity if we can

612
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,360
possibly avoid it

613
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,320
[Music]

614
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,439
and uh more generally the the same ip

615
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,120
restriction i think is really

616
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,120
interesting uh and i've said this i

617
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,360
think on the list but

618
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,918
i think that the same ip restriction is

619
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,520
is based on a threat model that i

620
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,039
haven't quite heard stated

621
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,480
precisely and that i'd like to get

622
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,440
stated precisely somewhere i think this

623
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
goes to our

624
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,360
um next segment discussion about what

625
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,199
equivalence really means

626
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,439
so uh i'd like to think some about that

627
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,399
my suspicion right now is that this

628
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,919
comes down to

629
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:58,399
a transient to persistent attack

630
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,399
upgrade concern yes yes

631
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,039
okay thanks

632
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,039
thank you ben david

633
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,399
hi david scanasi can you hear me yes we

634
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,840
can

635
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,639
ah it works cool so i

636
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,000
was wondering and it's kind of a 10 000

637
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,279
foot question

638
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,640
but uh one uh when our team on chrome

639
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,919
uh was you know is working on dough

640
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
one of the uh what the techniques we use

641
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,399
is kind of like auto upgrading to the

642
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,240
same ip

643
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,199
and one of the main feelings of that

644
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,320
technique is that the majority of users

645
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,440
have uh conf or are configured with a

646
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,158
dns resolver

647
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,520
that's you know in 1918 space uh pretty

648
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,440
much you know it's your little

649
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,200
whatever wi-fi router you bought is your

650
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,240
dns resolver

651
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,320
does this do anything to help us

652
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,520
with those devices or are those

653
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,639
considered out of scope

654
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,639
for for this proposal

655
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,840
the the private address on the local

656
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,120
network case right

657
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,120
yes yeah

658
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,559
so i think the question is

659
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,399
in those networks how are they adding

660
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,760
support for encrypted dns right because

661
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,918
presumably you're trying to find out

662
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,879
what is that network's encrypted dns

663
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,320
server

664
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,640
so i wanna

665
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,960
my point is that they're not um the

666
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
great majority of users on this planet

667
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,320
have a router that

668
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,880
they don't update the firmware for and

669
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,799
so that's not going to get encrypted dns

670
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
and so is that a problem that you're not

671
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,440
trying to tackle and if that's not a

672
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,600
scope that's totally fine i'm just

673
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,679
trying to make sure what the bounds are

674
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,158
right it it is not something that we

675
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,679
think

676
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,240
has a clear solution that doesn't open

677
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,559
up

678
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,600
another attack there are certainly ways

679
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,639
that you know

680
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,760
we can update those networks but

681
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
it is possible that there are going to

682
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,240
be certain

683
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
um routers that if they don't update and

684
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
they

685
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,879
you know don't let certain options be

686
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,840
passed through that you will not be able

687
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,679
to

688
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,918
just upgrade them to the equivalent one

689
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,360
without having some other provisioning

690
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,399
of like the name that you should be

691
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,678
using

692
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,918
for that network customer

693
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,720
yeah no just leave them because i i

694
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
think this

695
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
is and will remain the majority of users

696
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,000
and it's

697
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,840
like i would love to have a solution for

698
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,600
them but if this isn't it that's fine

699
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,959
it just means we need to have another

700
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,959
solution so let's try to find

701
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,559
you know not just that case in that case

702
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,559
seems to have a lot of mind fields in it

703
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,158
okay i mean and that's reasonable we can

704
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,320
start somewhere that's

705
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,559
easier and then build up from there cool

706
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
thank you

707
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,158
thank you david becker

708
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,879
yeah so i i actually think um this

709
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,678
mechanism is fighting with that a little

710
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,799
bit

711
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,159
um so i mean the the semantics of your

712
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,918
opportunistic right

713
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,000
are you say please go to ip blah

714
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,120
and if i people happens to match the ip

715
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,640
you have the resolver the mission

716
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
accomplished you upgrade right

717
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,600
but the solution that david's talking

718
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,000
about which is quite a common situation

719
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,918
is

720
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,760
where the uh um the client knows one ip

721
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,960
and the server is unaware of that ip

722
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
it's actually the case that if you just

723
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,440
connected

724
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,279
to that ip it might not work right um

725
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,840
and um so i think you know

726
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,120
i i i mean i actually asked you a

727
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,480
question what happened what happens with

728
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,879
these devices if you just

729
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,919
connect to like the ip the the ap and

730
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,720
try to do tls

731
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,720
i don't know do you

732
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,919
oh so like like

733
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,760
yeah is it chandra yeah yeah

734
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,120
we'll have to find out um i mean this is

735
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,799
actually i guess for

736
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,918
a dns curve right because he has

737
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,720
theoretically worked through these

738
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,320
devices

739
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,360
um yeah and to be clear like our

740
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,158
opportunistic

741
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,158
proposal here was defining what it means

742
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,960
to do it opportunistically based on

743
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,360
the hint from the special use domain

744
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,799
name

745
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:19,039
answer right

746
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,440
um so that that is something that

747
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,519
could still be you know theoretically

748
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,240
filtered out by a network

749
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,600
um right well i'm assuming i'm assuming

750
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,760
these devices are trying to stop you

751
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,279
they just don't care right

752
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,879
right um yeah they're trying to stop you

753
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,399
like game over right but um

754
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,159
yeah i mean i think the interesting

755
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,000
question to ask is

756
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,279
is there some mechanism i think as david

757
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,799
says is there a mechanism

758
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,080
where is there some set of cases where

759
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,840
in the what you have is basically a

760
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:53,279
um a pretty dumb forwarding resolver to

761
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,080
one of the large you know uh to one of

762
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,600
the large

763
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,120
uh you know resolve farms in the world

764
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,719
that would take dot or dough if you had

765
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,559
it and

766
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,679
like and you could talk to it because

767
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,639
because the foreign resolver doesn't try

768
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,240
to filter the traffic

769
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,559
is there some way to upgrade dough in

770
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,720
those cases um yeah and it feels like

771
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,918
as it's not quite clear how to do that

772
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,799
but that seems like a problem which is

773
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,039
worth

774
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,320
worth working on if i mean we've sort of

775
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,600
chosen in this case to pick some various

776
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,039
types of threat models but there was a

777
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,039
very restrictive like

778
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,120
um you know use case model like that

779
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,399
like it's really only like one of 10

780
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,518
resolvers these are some way to fix the

781
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:29,120
problem

782
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:33,919
yeah there's you know one other point

783
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,360
with these forwarders

784
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,840
when we talk about the definition of

785
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,320
equivalency

786
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,279
i'm wondering like is it true that they

787
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,519
would be equivalent

788
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,720
to whatever it is because if they are a

789
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,159
forwarder that is technically

790
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,200
intercepting the messages

791
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,080
they often do some level of filtering or

792
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,080
they have some

793
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,199
extra override for showing you the page

794
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,399
of your router when you

795
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,360
load on the page and skipping it would

796
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,799
change it

797
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,799
so it kind of out by definition of

798
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,000
this really is the same resolver and if

799
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,200
you want something that is equivalent

800
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,799
you need to change your original

801
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,600
resolver yeah and do you i mean do you

802
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,759
have any data

803
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,440
on i mean additionally for digital for

804
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,800
david too do you have any data on

805
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,599
a fraction of like um you know apparent

806
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,240
result

807
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,280
of resolvers actually uh you know have

808
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,279
some 1988 address

809
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,320
uh we don't currently have that but

810
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,119
that's something that we don't either

811
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,119
get

812
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,480
yeah it sounds like a worthwhile thing

813
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,399
to collect metrics and i think

814
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,918
i think the case the relevant cases i

815
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,359
think like people who don't have

816
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,759
some obviously hand-configured address

817
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,239
like one one one one and also don't have

818
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,520
like um and also not 19 address

819
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:45,598
also um right okay there are also

820
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,239
a lot of networks that do give out um

821
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,599
you know other resolver ip addresses

822
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,078
like i think a lot of comcast networks

823
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,280
you know

824
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,440
their cps and stuff will give

825
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,399
addresses that are not private addresses

826
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,000
no right

827
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,279
right well that's the case that's that's

828
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
thing we should be that's what i want to

829
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
measure

830
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,880
so yeah

831
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,880
thank you ecker tyru please

832
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:21,759
your mic is not transmitting

833
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,760
tyro are you here

834
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,720
oh okay is mike coming online i think

835
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:32,240
there's some problem

836
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,240
can you hear me yes now we can hello

837
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:42,160
hello hello hello we hear you hello

838
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,960
oh everybody else besides me here is him

839
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
right yeah

840
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,839
um yeah

841
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,800
but thiru has turned off his mic so

842
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,800
let's uh while he sports that out martin

843
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,079
oh hiro might be back though so

844
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:13,839
hello okay we can you hear us here

845
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,839
we hear you

846
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,480
okay uh i'll send them a side channel

847
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,480
message

848
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
yes

849
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,839
continue

850
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,119
i was going to continue this

851
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,240
conversation that ecker and tommy were

852
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,440
having here and

853
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,640
uh suggest that perhaps the the case

854
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,040
that they're talking about where someone

855
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,759
has

856
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,640
the 1918 address and the the dom

857
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,800
forwarder

858
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,839
kind of works in this case because you

859
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,440
make the query to the

860
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:04,000
special use domain name and you get back

861
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,839
an ip address and you just connect to it

862
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,520
and use door

863
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,279
dot or whatever it is that it tells you

864
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,520
to do and we're

865
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,119
done here because what we're looking at

866
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,200
here is a case where you don't have a

867
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,320
reference identity necessarily

868
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,160
uh it does mean that

869
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
you don't get any of the properties that

870
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,000
we might be interested in terms of um

871
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,400
being able to rely on the dhcp

872
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,359
or ra providing something that we might

873
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,839
trust

874
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,560
um with scare quotes but i think it gets

875
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,359
it

876
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,160
gets a lot of what we're kind of looking

877
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,200
for in the end

878
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,240
so for those cases that i'm interested

879
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,160
in particularly

880
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,000
the case where we're looking to say go

881
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,040
to the uh

882
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
dear dog server that's being provided by

883
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,359
an isp

884
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,079
outside of the home network then i think

885
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,640
what we have is this is probably enough

886
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,359
for that

887
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,078
use case so essentially you're saying

888
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,119
relax any checks and just say the

889
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,839
addresses don't

890
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,200
match but just use it anyway

891
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,200
you don't have a reference identity in

892
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,240
that case right um

893
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,879
and then the question is what what name

894
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,040
do you go

895
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,079
go looking for and and that's a little

896
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,640
bit challenging but

897
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,240
um you've already started out in in

898
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,118
completely insecure context

899
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,560
with no um nobody or trust in anything

900
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
so

901
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,440
i don't know it's even weaker than that

902
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,480
than the other model where you accept

903
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,680
that the dhcp

904
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,040
is is secure but it could work

905
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,040
yeah yeah i think

906
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,480
i mean we need to consider the fact that

907
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,598
it creates

908
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,240
a potentially an encrypted channel to

909
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,839
someone who

910
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,839
may be an attacker

911
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,680
it allows them to allow them to do that

912
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,960
if they can essentially

913
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,078
successfully inject one packet to you

914
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,560
and trick you

915
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,920
whereas before in order to intercept all

916
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
of your dnf traffic they had to do it

917
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,119
continually so it's

918
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,320
the kind of temporary versus persistent

919
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,560
attack

920
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,839
yeah it's not not a great position to be

921
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,119
in but um

922
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,119
it's it's just an option to take

923
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,760
yeah it's certainly an option and

924
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,240
some people may want to do it some

925
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,520
people may not and and so one one reason

926
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,799
i pointed that out is that we

927
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,400
potentially have a context

928
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,320
particularly with our trusted recursive

929
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,680
resolver program where there are certain

930
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,000
identities that we might be willing to

931
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,040
connect

932
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,359
to anyway and others

933
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,720
and so right gives us potentially a path

934
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,279
to doing that sort of thing

935
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,000
right right right so is there an

936
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,400
alternative way of

937
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,200
blessing the results say yeah even if

938
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,720
you

939
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,040
are lying to me you're sending me to a

940
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,200
legitimate place so i'll take it

941
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,800
yeah exactly that's good yeah

942
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,399
thank you martin uh one of the things

943
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,720
i'll note is that we are

944
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
40 minutes into our 60 minute session

945
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,598
and this has been a really good

946
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,520
conversation and there's still a couple

947
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,200
people in the queue and

948
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,359
uh could well be another couple while we

949
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,439
did have another item on the agenda

950
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,119
uh about talking about resolver

951
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,640
equivalence um

952
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,520
that will also probably um take a fair

953
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,240
bit of time

954
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
and so we will just plan on rolling that

955
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,759
discussion

956
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,560
into the next session um so we're not

957
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,160
cutting off

958
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,078
as long as this conversation is still

959
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,839
being productive we're gonna keep this

960
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,640
one going as long as it takes right now

961
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
so

962
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,440
uh david please

963
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,279
hey david snazzy again chrome um

964
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,240
so first off i want to answer um edgar's

965
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,119
question

966
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,839
about uh numbers so these are numbers

967
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
collected by

968
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,000
eric horth uh on chrome um

969
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,160
apparently what chrome sees worldwide

970
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,880
is um only 15

971
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,560
of users have non-private addresses

972
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,680
configured for their dns

973
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,880
so 85 of users the vast majority of the

974
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,759
internet

975
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,079
is configured with a 1918 dns resolver

976
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,079
so

977
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,960
whatever wi-fi router you bought 10

978
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,560
years ago that's your dns resolver

979
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,040
another stat that could be interesting

980
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,400
to focus is of those 15

981
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,680
half of them map to known

982
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,079
dos servers like quantitate and so forth

983
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,399
um so all this to say like we

984
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,240
it sounds like we're building a solution

985
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,280
for an incredibly small

986
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,879
minority of users and that sounds like

987
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,000
not necessarily the first priority to me

988
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,599
um i i want to also second like what mt

989
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,920
was saying you could make

990
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,480
this you know parts of this work uh by

991
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,440
using queries that go through your

992
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,040
um cheap old router to some to something

993
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
that might understand them in the isp

994
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,599
network if the isp is

995
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,040
willing to stand up dough um

996
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,440
my personal two sense is uh that's

997
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,480
even if that's not properly vetted and

998
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,839
trusted it's still

999
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,000
better than what we have today where

1000
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,920
everything is in the clear so

1001
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,640
uh maybe kind of weakening the security

1002
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,400
model here might improve user security

1003
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,799
yeah that's good and thanks for the

1004
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,280
stats on that that's very useful to have

1005
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,480
um you know one option that also comes

1006
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,760
to mind

1007
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,760
is we can have

1008
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,599
potentially different recommendations

1009
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,440
for what to do when we have 1918

1010
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,720
addresses essentially allow more

1011
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,400
goosey opportunistic um upgrade

1012
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,759
when you have a private address that you

1013
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
know can't

1014
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,760
be authenticated versus if someone has

1015
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,319
configured

1016
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,760
quad one or quad eight and making sure

1017
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,240
that that cannot be

1018
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,240
attacked

1019
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,200
okay thank you david and tommy on to ben

1020
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,400
hey so ben schwartz

1021
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,919
so i've heard a few different

1022
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,920
suggestions of ways that you could

1023
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,839
potentially

1024
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,760
key loosening of the

1025
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,160
matching requirements in opportunistic

1026
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,800
mode so i heard something about

1027
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,759
um match keying that on the basis of

1028
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,880
whether the

1029
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,920
ip is rxe 1918 i heard

1030
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,119
um keying it on the basis of whether the

1031
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
uh encrypted resolver ip is on a list of

1032
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,280
known

1033
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,960
nicely behaved resolvers another

1034
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,560
condition that i think could be

1035
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,040
interesting is if the client

1036
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
knows more about the network that it's

1037
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,040
on

1038
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,240
so for example if the

1039
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,440
if the configuration came to the client

1040
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,720
in in an ipv6ra

1041
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,240
and the client has some way to assess

1042
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,799
the network and say this network

1043
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,680
probably does not have ra guard

1044
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,680
functionality

1045
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,280
then that would be maybe another case

1046
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,359
where we can say there's essentially

1047
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,599
nothing to protect here

1048
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,920
and so we can be we can be more open to

1049
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,359
redirection

1050
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,680
yeah that's good thank you ben we're

1051
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,000
going to try kiru again

1052
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,799
hello guys can you hear me wrong yes we

1053
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,160
can

1054
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,000
hey can you hear me hey

1055
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,598
i mean this draft is a great start uh so

1056
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,200
what we are doing to solve the private

1057
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,480
ip addresses problem at least on the

1058
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,640
routers where

1059
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,119
uh we have our security services what we

1060
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,359
are trying to do is uh we are using acme

1061
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,720
where uh either the isp or the security

1062
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,920
provider would

1063
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,480
give an unique io domain name

1064
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,680
and then we are using acme to assign and

1065
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,760
certificate to that so

1066
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,359
that what would happen is that the

1067
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,920
endpoint would be still

1068
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,078
able to use tls with the doh or dot

1069
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,000
forwarder hosted on the router

1070
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,640
and then if the router still continues

1071
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,520
to use private app addresses for

1072
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,200
serving uh the encrypted dna service but

1073
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
that will be only visible

1074
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,879
to the endpoint devices connected to the

1075
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,400
home and not to

1076
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,400
anybody else outside the home network

1077
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,760
but where we are currently struck at

1078
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,680
with regard to uh our draft is referring

1079
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,119
for draft is referring to using dhcp ra

1080
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,960
to solve that problem and

1081
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,720
we have a dependency on the router to

1082
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,680
support that but

1083
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,598
it's not clear if we move to a linux

1084
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
based mechanism for discovery how would

1085
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:33,839
that work and

1086
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:33,839
how would that problem be solved

1087
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,240
uh tommy do you wanna

1088
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,240
i don't think i have any particular

1089
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,240
comments for that one

1090
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,479
okay great uh so tyro anything else

1091
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,118
i don't know thanks okay thank you uh

1092
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,119
ecker please

1093
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,520
so like i i have to admit i expected the

1094
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,560
numbers to be

1095
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,640
not as bad as david indicated um those

1096
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,319
are pretty terrible um

1097
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,319
uh and i think we really um

1098
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,680
like i think in light of that we need to

1099
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,720
really go back and ask what we're trying

1100
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,919
to do here

1101
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:13,919
um because if we're trying i mean

1102
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,119
if you go back and you say like you know

1103
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,400
and you if

1104
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,000
you i mean i mean it's if it sounds to

1105
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,920
me like if we're not solving the problem

1106
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,359
of people who have like 1983

1107
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,800
as a resolver then we're like not doing

1108
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,799
very much useful so

1109
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,480
um like like

1110
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,919
maybe go back and ask how to solve that

1111
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,440
problem and then see that this that prob

1112
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,400
that problem extends to other things

1113
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,599
but i mean like i know i know

1114
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,720
strategists all probably think you can

1115
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:38,079
solve but i think like

1116
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,279
i mean if we know that 85 percent of

1117
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,599
people like have the problem some other

1118
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,720
problem we need for that problem

1119
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,800
um and i think you know this has been

1120
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
useful to flush that out but um and this

1121
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,040
is for the chairs

1122
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,799
like we really need if i think we really

1123
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,240
need to like you know

1124
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,640
we can fare the problem definition at

1125
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,640
this point

1126
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,319
uh definitely agree on that we're

1127
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:01,440
working toward that

1128
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:02,800
um i will note that uh with eric's last

1129
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,400
comments that was actually the end of

1130
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,240
the queue but there's also been quite a

1131
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,520
lot of active discussion in jabber if

1132
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,598
anybody there

1133
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,440
uh would this is your kind of your last

1134
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,040
call you

1135
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,560
think that you've made a salient comment

1136
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,359
there that should actually make it into

1137
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,440
the notes and

1138
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,319
and come to the rest of the group then

1139
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,319
please step forward

1140
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,240
come another couple of seconds or i'll

1141
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,240
hand it back to glenn

1142
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,040
okay glenn off to you again

1143
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,240
awesome i'm just going to show my screen

1144
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,680
here

1145
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,839
let's see how much time do we have left

1146
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,839
oh

1147
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,000
all right um so uh the next topic we're

1148
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,400
going to talk about is equivalent

1149
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,680
resolvers and i was really happy to be

1150
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,480
able to finally use this

1151
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,480
um clip art of apples and oranges

1152
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,598
so um this is a

1153
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,800
slide that chris box has made pulling uh

1154
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,160
out the definition that is currently in

1155
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,839
uh draft box add requirements which

1156
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:20,480
uh is uh what the deer draft

1157
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,359
my understanding was based upon and so

1158
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,800
we thought that

1159
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,960
given there's some discussion about this

1160
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,760
on the list and

1161
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,280
this is kind of a an important sort of

1162
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,520
discussion point that

1163
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,720
the deer draft is based upon we thought

1164
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,280
that it'd be really good

1165
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,480
uh topic of conversation for us to

1166
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,119
explore

1167
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,000
what this group really wants to tease

1168
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,359
this out

1169
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,400
to mean uh so i'll read you know for

1170
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,880
for everybody here what is equivalence

1171
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,839
given two resolvers a and b equivalence

1172
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:53,200
is the claim that

1173
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,799
a and b can provide the same upper layer

1174
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,200
dns function ie

1175
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,359
response messages towards the client

1176
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,240
this does not include the dns transport

1177
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,119
protocol

1178
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,078
such as a regular doe 53 or dns over

1179
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,119
https or

1180
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,559
or dot um which can

1181
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,440
differ between equivalent resolvers

1182
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,359
so far there's been two modes of how you

1183
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,760
assert this claim of equivalence

1184
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,279
one would be network identified where

1185
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,319
somewhere at the network level

1186
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,760
either through the dhcp or ra there is

1187
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,880
this

1188
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,240
information given out that says hey b is

1189
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,000
equivalent to a

1190
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,000
and you can go with that and then

1191
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,880
there's a resolver identified where

1192
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,960
uh resolver a uh says that b is

1193
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,319
equivalent to it

1194
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,000
so with that um i i

1195
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,079
i'm gonna just open the floor and let

1196
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,760
people discuss

1197
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,400
what is your interpretation of

1198
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
equivalence do you see this

1199
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,680
definition as we have it now as being

1200
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,759
sufficient and complete

1201
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,118
do we need to further tease out some

1202
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,000
cases around it

1203
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,559
uh sort of let's explore this topic have

1204
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,200
at it

1205
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,240
we'll run this until about five minutes

1206
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,000
before the end of the

1207
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,359
session which will then cut off the

1208
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
queue and we'll

1209
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,680
pick up this conversation uh on the

1210
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,240
friday session when we

1211
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,040
when we uh have it in the end of the

1212
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,799
week

1213
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,440
okay david i'll turn it back over to you

1214
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,440
to manage the queue

1215
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,839
martin please

1216
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,040
so many permissions dialogues i had a

1217
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,558
slightly different thing but i think

1218
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,839
this one's mostly okay

1219
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:41,760
so my um my kind of understanding was

1220
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:44,960
um i said what did i say

1221
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:48,000
i said um whatever resolver you

1222
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,079
currently have assume that you got that

1223
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,599
through means that is absolutely secure

1224
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,680
and you can communicate it

1225
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,559
with it through means that are also

1226
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,839
absolutely secure

1227
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:03,440
then using that information um

1228
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,160
find an equivalent dot doh or dot

1229
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,119
resolver that you can use on a

1230
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,399
completely

1231
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,040
insecure network um and that's a

1232
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,760
different way of

1233
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,160
formulating that um and it still has the

1234
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,760
same

1235
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,279
sort of constraints on it in terms of

1236
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,559
network identification and resolver

1237
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,599
identification but

1238
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,119
um i'm moderately happy with this with

1239
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,400
this formulation i can't see anything

1240
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,400
wrong with it aside from that

1241
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,720
great thank you martin ecker

1242
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,399
as i indicated on the list i'm not

1243
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,240
having this regulation and i'm actually

1244
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,119
surprised martin is because martin said

1245
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,759
is incredibly different from the

1246
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,079
simulation

1247
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,440
like this formulation could absolutely

1248
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,240
include a resolver which gave you the

1249
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,800
same answers

1250
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,399
but posted your like responses posted

1251
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,200
your queries to twitter which surely is

1252
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,880
not okay

1253
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,000
um so um uh

1254
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,680
including one was operated by the

1255
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,160
attacker so i think um you know

1256
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,078
tradition

1257
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,118
i i sent some text to the list um i

1258
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,000
don't think it's perfect but i think

1259
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:05,839
it's

1260
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,839
more bright lines than this

1261
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,680
is that attacker oh yes i just yeah

1262
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,680
okay thank you uh ben please

1263
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:22,880
hey so to reiterate something i've said

1264
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,040
many times now i think the

1265
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
we need to talk about a temporal

1266
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,920
component here

1267
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:33,280
about whether two resolvers

1268
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:36,559
um not only are equivalent but

1269
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,680
are going to stay equivalent

1270
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:43,119
because if there's an attacker who

1271
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:46,399
in our model can can uh can be present

1272
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,480
only briefly then i think that

1273
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,359
that changes our conception of what it

1274
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,359
means to be equivalent

1275
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:58,559
uh yep ted please

1276
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,200
so the point i wanted to make was

1277
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:06,400
actually about the response messages

1278
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,240
and i think that the concern i have is

1279
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,240
if somebody tries to test is this in

1280
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,799
fact equivalent by continuing to ask

1281
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,558
both for some period of time that the

1282
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,839
response messages could be different

1283
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,280
from the two different ones

1284
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,440
even though their behavior toward the

1285
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,480
rest of the domain name system is in

1286
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,160
fact the same

1287
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,040
just because unless they're actually

1288
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,359
serving out of the same cache

1289
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:29,040
and you know using the same mechanics

1290
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,480
upstream to query the

1291
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,200
um either to forward the upstream uh

1292
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,920
resolver or the authoritatives they can

1293
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,240
get different

1294
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,839
answers just because of the behavior of

1295
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:43,439
the rest of the system

1296
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,200
changing over time in ways that

1297
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,880
is not related to the function of the

1298
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,520
resolver

1299
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,280
um so i think we want to be careful

1300
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,520
about giving a simple test like

1301
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,079
the response messages you would get from

1302
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,400
a and b would be the same

1303
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,960
i think that the claim that they provide

1304
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,240
the same upper layer functionality

1305
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,599
is closer but much less well-defined and

1306
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,640
i think you'd actually have to write

1307
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,280
down what

1308
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,839
what pieces of that dns functionality

1309
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,200
are in fact the same in order to get it

1310
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,920
um something that the the client could

1311
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,399
be sure of

1312
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,119
and i i do worry that most of that is

1313
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:23,200
completely untestable by the

1314
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,880
uh the client so they're they're to get

1315
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,558
an assertion but there's no way for them

1316
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,480
to confirm it

1317
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,000
except the response messages which might

1318
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,000
give you false data

1319
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,839
thank you dad mike bishop please

1320
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,759
um i just wanted to note that the

1321
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,640
definition

1322
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,680
of equivalence that was used earlier was

1323
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,598
that it is

1324
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,000
managed by the same entity or at the

1325
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,200
same ip address i think this is at least

1326
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,559
a step in a better direction

1327
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:01,839
that even two dns

1328
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,599
servers managed by the same entity might

1329
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,200
deliberately have different policies and

1330
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,960
behave in different ways so

1331
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,558
you know the filtering and the

1332
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,000
non-filtering dns

1333
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,839
endpoints for example can't be

1334
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,520
equivalent

1335
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:18,240
but yeah and there's more complexity

1336
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:20,799
than just

1337
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,319
it gives you the same response right now

1338
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,920
because it might not

1339
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:27,680
but it provides the same service

1340
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,920
i don't know how better to quantify that

1341
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,919
though

1342
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,040
okay thank you mike um i'll mention now

1343
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,160
that we are closing the queue

1344
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,960
um well uh ralph dropped when eric

1345
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,759
joined so

1346
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,720
eric you'll you'll be mq um and dkg

1347
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,040
please

1348
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,558
jim you're gonna have to save her for

1349
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:49,920
next session

1350
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,599
uh daniel kahn gilmore aclu um so

1351
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,200
i want to echo what other folks have

1352
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,559
said here uh that

1353
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,520
that looking at the response messages is

1354
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,880
uh extremely weak for the questions that

1355
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,880
i think we care about here

1356
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,240
the reason that we're doing you know dns

1357
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,200
privacy and these other transports of

1358
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,959
change is that there are a lot of

1359
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,078
factors beyond just what answers do you

1360
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,280
get

1361
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:14,799
um ecker pointed out you know

1362
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,640
what about a dns server that

1363
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,319
that sends to twitter that republishes

1364
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,680
to twitter

1365
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,359
uh but there are several others i wanted

1366
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,640
to point out that the latency may be

1367
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:26,000
another factor

1368
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,598
in terms of the cache um linkability

1369
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,640
whether the peer can even

1370
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:31,200
link your queries across time whether

1371
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:45,839
the peer

1372
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:45,839
requires client authentication

1373
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,960
hey everyone

1374
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:37,839
looks like we had to do a reboot

1375
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,599
do we have dkg back yet that was really

1376
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,799
interesting what he was saying

1377
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,520
i'm back um i

1378
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:21,200
don't know exactly where where the split

1379
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,880
happened

1380
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,480
but i just wanted to echo i think what

1381
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,920
ecker and ted were saying

1382
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,640
um which is that the

1383
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,920
the reason that we're doing dns privacy

1384
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,078
the reason that we're running into these

1385
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,599
problems here now anyway is that

1386
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,440
there's far more than uh did i get the

1387
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,880
same records

1388
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,200
that we care about when we're talking to

1389
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,559
a dns resolver eckers

1390
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,399
description of you know something that

1391
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,000
goes to twitter that republishes all the

1392
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,599
queries to twitter is just one factor

1393
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,680
right there's other questions about

1394
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,839
latency about the ability of the

1395
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,480
resolver to do link up to link

1396
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,400
the clients queries across time whether

1397
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,280
that's with cookies or tls sessions or

1398
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,200
whatever

1399
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,200
whether the uh resolver does client

1400
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,200
authentication that kind of thing

1401
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,399
so so i just think that this definition

1402
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,558
is way too weak

1403
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,680
to to decide in the context that we're

1404
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,480
talking right now

1405
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,520
and dan i'm i'm gonna jump in and pause

1406
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,079
you're right there because that's a

1407
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,359
great

1408
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,119
final statement um uh

1409
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,720
i don't know if we got it into the notes

1410
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,000
because i think some of the oh

1411
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,000
some of those are getting captured now

1412
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,359
but thank you barbara um

1413
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,359
because i think everyone's just sort of

1414
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:30,558
coming back from uh

1415
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:34,160
the mido medeco incident so

1416
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,720
uh we're at time uh and so i i would

1417
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,879
hope

1418
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,240
to end this a little bit more gracefully

1419
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,119
than than this

1420
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,160
uh let me say this so we're gonna carry

1421
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,440
over this conversation

1422
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,160
because it's a good conversation that

1423
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,960
we're having we can have it on the list

1424
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,000
between now and friday but we're going

1425

going to be i expect will be discussed

1430

on the list because now you're all

1431
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,839

1432
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,920
