virtual

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,880
video conferencing technology everything

21
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,040
is fine

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,158
uh bangkok 2020

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
ietf meeting

24
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,400
as you are very well aware by now i am

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
sure

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,280
we operate under the note well that

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,839
knows it well all that

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
it tells you how to behave and how not

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,360
to behave

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,119
and so do that and don't do that as

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,600
appropriate

32
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
if you have any questions please do ask

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,439
i know i'm being very flippant about it

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,159
but it is really important that we

35
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,520
we have guide rails around how we behave

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
and that we all behave

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,119
i just told people that discussion is

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,479
very respectful in this working group

39
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
and they should come here rather than

40
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,079
some of the others so

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,240
you're in the right place well done

42
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,679
with that said this is the agenda that i

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,038
put together

44
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,760
based on what it looks like our work is

45
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
from the queue of documents we have if

46
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,160
anyone has

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,640
any changes amendments to make to this

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,319

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,440
switch to them when we get them

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
oh yeah they were there a moment ago and

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
they've gone away

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,560
yep oh i see oh okay i thought yeah yeah

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,400
so i'll switch to them when we're ready

63
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,200
to go

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,959
great okay so your yours are at the end

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,839
according to this list so i'm happy to

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,720
shuffle things around if people would

67
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
like

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,680
oh oh okay we're not going to spend that

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,599
long on the submitted documents just

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,519
wanted to quickly talk about

71
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,799
where we're at with them um no i didn't

72
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,920
actually bring that up which i probably

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,159
should have

74
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,159
but that's okay i can easily just go

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:28,560
sorry to the documents here that's right

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,120
yep um so if we glance here

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
at these documents we can see event pub

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,760
is the first one it's

79
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,040
it's uh been waiting a while

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,440
and barry what have we got here yeah i

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
just

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,920
um the changes in the security

83
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,119
considerations look

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,679
pretty good i just sent a response uh

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
about an hour ago or two hours ago or i

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,200
don't know something like that it's the

87
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,480
times are weird right now

88
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,439
uh to michael so uh

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,959
my discuss is almost ready to clear uh

90
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,120
and i've pinged uh

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,560
ben cadek asking him to have a look at

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,000
uh

93
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,159
at the version 16. so cool

94
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,159
um

95
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
a more general topic i'd like to avoid

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,600
winding up in this kind of situation

97
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
again is there anything

98
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,759
we could be doing as chairs to to

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
progress things faster through this

100
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,960
stage

101
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,758
well yeah uh the delays have mostly been

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,280
getting responses back and forth um you

103
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,280
know it's taken michael a while to

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,520
respond and then it takes the ads a

105
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,039
while to respond and

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,719
you know and then when you go back and

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
forth so i guess the what i would

108
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
suggest is that the document

109
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,880
shepard needs to to be a shepherd and uh

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,559
start running around in circles and

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,960
barking when things don't happen

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,400
quickly enough all right i'm looking

113
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,039
forward to seeing that daniel since this

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,039
one's your one

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
i i believe that um um one of the issue

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,639
the issue we have

117
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,120
is that when i mean when the ad is

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,479
providing comments

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,680
i mean we should try to respond um

120
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,400
let's say in the two three days

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
otherwise the id is switching context

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,599
and then it takes a lot of time to

123
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,080
bring it back so i guess in the case of

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
ben

125
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,639
now it's a little bit uh we're a little

126
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,639
bit in that situation is

127
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,759
it has to and in to switch context then

128
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
that's um

129
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
that takes a lot of time so yeah well

130
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,280
and the more reactive we

131
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
are the better it is

132
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
correct and he he's been particularly

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,720
busy in recent months as well

134
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,880
so some of some of us other ads have

135
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,440
picked up some of his documents to move

136
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,000
forward

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,840
so that his working groups wouldn't

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,080
languish while he tried to

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,599
through everything so it's you know

140
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,400
there's no one person

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,560
is causing the delays it's just yeah as

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
different people get involved the delays

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
mushroom

144
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,719
and having somebody actively chasing

145
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,719
that down

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,479
and saying hey it's been a couple of

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
weeks and there's been no response to

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,960
this can you go check again

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
can you give a response yeah i'm as

150
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
guilty of this as anybody

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,880
else i've noticed

152
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,479
is that the document that um

153
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:37,039
went out of the documents list or

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
that was the uh relations draft i think

155
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,120
oh the relationship

156
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,560
okay yeah

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:48,880
um yeah and i think um

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,000
i'm as responsive as anybody else i um

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,560
i guess a little bit of oddly enough you

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,479
know

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
i've had a few standards go through the

162
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,159
process

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
um i wasn't it wasn't actually clear in

164
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,639
my own mind i should i should look at

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,639
this the

166
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,479
outstanding stuff in the data tracker i

167
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,360
was so relying on the mailing list more

168
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,960
than the

169
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
data tracker and perhaps a pointer back

170
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
into that

171
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,960
to say to remind people to check it and

172
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,960
see what's outstanding

173
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,919
um right uh it's

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,120
that that might be useful is to have

175
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,919
some automatic

176
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,440
um thing from the data tracker that says

177
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,359
hey this stuff is still hanging around

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
we've we've actually talked about that

179
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,440
with the tools team

180
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,759
and um it's questionable how

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
some of us would love to have the data

182
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,280
tracker send us reminders

183
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,719
that hey this has been hanging out and

184
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,638
nothing's happened

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,240
uh other people get very irritated when

186
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,800
the data tracker starts

187
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
automatically reminding them of things

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
um

189
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,719
so yeah but we are working with the

190
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
tools team on

191
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
coming up with a good answer for this

192
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,239
and um having

193
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,599
some flag in the data tracker for who

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,520
has the action

195
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,919
whether the action is on the author or

196
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,159
the ad or the yeah

197
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
or whatever but the alternative between

198
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,440
the data tracker

199
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
irritating you is having some individual

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,879
irritating other people

201
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,840
yes no nobody loves chasing up their

202
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,039
debtors

203
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,159
whether it's for work or for money yeah

204
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:26,878
well anyway yeah in any case uh

205
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
i i think we're we're nearing the end of

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
the

207
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,879
event pub extensions i hope something

208
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,879
like this

209
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880

awesome thank you uh next is the alarm

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,399
extensions i believe we're still waiting

228
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,399
for ipr confirmation from apple yeah

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,720
so for the gs calendar it means we need

230
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,720
to wait

231
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,720
um for an isg till a chat

232
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,920
yep so but i mean it's

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
it's in progress we don't need to wait

234
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
for it

235
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,599
it will get scheduled now that barry's

236
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
clicked the button yeah yeah

237
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,320
cool whereas for vlm extensions we just

238
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,319
have to wait

239
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,680
apple just so j i just clicked the

240
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,399
button for js calendar so you should see

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,439
it going into the rfc editor queue

242
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,640
by tomorrow okay so

243
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,519
okay so he passed the ifg telechat

244
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,880
and he's in the rfc editor okay good

245
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,040
that's where it goes next

246
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,880
yeah the the secretariat has to do their

247
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,839
magic and then it goes to the arps

248
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,839
theater

249
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
okay

250
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,079
cool with vlm extensions are we

251
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,199
basically

252
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,839
at the mercy of apple at this point i

253
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
mean

254
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,680
short of rewriting it from scratch

255
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,760
there's not much we can do is there

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,279
um the question i had is um

257
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,560
in a i mean what if for example

258
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,600
um we don't have any ipr

259
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,119
disclosure is is there any way we can

260
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
move that document forward

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
can we just strip the author's name and

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,479
basically

263
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,480
uh

264
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,360
no i i was wondering what that would be

265
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
i mean cyrus is going to provide them i

266
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
guess at some point

267
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,279
so um and and it's not him so

268
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
but i was wondering um because it's a

269
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,040
common situation

270
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,040
that i mean for example author is not

271
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,640
responsive

272
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,839
um and so i mean we don't know what to

273
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,680
do with this ipr

274
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,680
so so that was mostly a question for

275
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
barry

276
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,719
find the tab that has the mute button so

277
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,320
there we go um

278
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,399
all right so i what is the uh okay

279
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,399
i didn't i don't understand the issue

280
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:11,839
there are no ipr disclosures

281
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,839
for that for the alarm extensions

282
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,000
we asked cyrus whether there were ipr

283
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,839
disclosures and cyrus said i'll have to

284
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,839
check with apple legal and apple legal

285
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,959
have not responded yet

286
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:27,200
okay uh cyrus should not be

287
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,560
checking with apple legal on that so

288
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,639
maybe you can ping him again and the the

289
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,760
bcp 79 rules say that

290
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,399
it's your personal knowledge

291
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,639
you do you don't need to go research it

292
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
if you don't have personal knowledge you

293
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,959
do not have a

294
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,079
a requirement under bcp 79

295
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,119
so i suspect it's an apple

296
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,439
rule right apparently different and if

297
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,760
that's the case then

298
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
i i don't know what to do but you also

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
if if cyrus was

300
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
an integral part of putting this

301
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,000
document together you can't just take

302
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,160
his name off

303
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,160
of it either so uh yeah no no

304
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
yeah what's strange is what's strange to

305
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,599
me is that is cyrus has

306
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,120
authored several other high calendar

307
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
related drafts

308
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
and we never seem to have this issue

309
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,279
with legal unless he had started the

310
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
process way

311
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,360
way earlier and we were just never aware

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,959
of the fact that it was going through

313
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,959
apple legal

314
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,560
right i think i think the situation is

315
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,560
perhaps there is something that he's

316
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,518
aware of that he's just checking on

317
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,560
whether it meets the criteria for

318
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,240
uh for disclosure so i you know i don't

319
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,359
know what the situation is but

320
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,160
um i i guess the thing is to just hound

321
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,839
cyrus

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,839
mercilessly until he responds

323
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,000
i think the situation has changed over

324
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
time

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,760
since he wrote yes apple legal have

326
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,359
probably

327
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,959
become more world averse or something

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,800
who knows who knows no i think i think

329
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,439
in wilfredo's time they never bothered

330
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,439
telling apple

331
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,519
that's the other way to do it isn't it

332
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,519
peter squared ahead

333
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
all right so i guess there's an action

334
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,839
on you

335
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,760
then daniel to follow up

336
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,199
sorry he appears to be shepherd for this

337
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,360
yeah i mean a week ago he didn't have it

338
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,359
so

339
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,480
all right cool um our next slide

340
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,160
is ical relations um

341
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,839
this isn't working group last call i'm

342
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,600
the shepherd for this one

343
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,040
the last calls expired and i just didn't

344
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,440
get around to dealing with it this is

345
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,240
the

346
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,160
it's my fault bit can anyone see any

347
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,040
reason not for me not to push the button

348
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
straight after this

349
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,920
and submit it

350
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,079
what is today now what is the end of the

351
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,079
day

352
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,480
well the 19th of november but the the

353
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,360
last call was

354
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,600
well over a month ago and no one said

355
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,760
anything

356
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,360
so i've still got four hours

357
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,839
three and three quarter hours left in my

358
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,839
day which is more than enough time

359
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,360
i'm hearing zero objections and given

360
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
that there were no objections on the

361
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440
mental state

362
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,439
i will just do the thing

363
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,040
great that sounds quite delightful and i

364
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
will uh

365
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,719
have something to read tomorrow i guess

366
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
awesome

367
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
uh j calendar i can't i don't have any

368
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,759
slides for this one

369
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
um but it was mostly mike working with

370
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,079
robert

371
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,279
on making sure that it was complete and

372
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
accurate

373
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,519
what's left there um

374
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,040
well i i it's like i guess a lot is down

375
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,120
to me at the moment

376
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,279
um there was the issue over

377
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:14,240
handling the um the recurrence id

378
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,240
in in um

379
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,399
you know standalone uh

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,320
recurrence instances and

381
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,320
neil came up with suggestion which i

382
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,920
guess i don't think i responded to

383
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,600
actually

384
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:36,959
um but i think it'll work

385
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:40,399
um unfortunately i got i got a bit um

386
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,399
bogged down on um

387
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,279
a sort of a side issue nothing to do

388
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,759
with js calendar and i can't i got

389
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,519
bogged down in trying to upgrade my

390
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,639
ical4j

391
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,279
library so i i just i got bogged down

392
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
with that

393
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,079
that particular issue and i'm about to

394
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,199
pick up on this stuff again i don't

395
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,199
think there's anything

396
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,678
huge outstanding i'm hoping

397
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,280
that um it'll be relatively plain

398
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,720
sailing to work through

399
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,720
um i've done all the

400
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,280
um js calendar eye calendar

401
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,000
conversion i was working on the uh i

402
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,760
called it a js calendar conversion

403
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,839
and just steadily working my way through

404
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
the uh the draft

405
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,119
as i as i was actually implementing as i

406
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,679
went along so

407
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,199
hopefully in a few weeks it'll be

408
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,320
wrapped up

409
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,640
hopefully less than a few weeks

410
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,639
let's see how it goes um

411
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:46,160
okay so when you i guess the plan is

412
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,360
when you review the document

413
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,000
and you agree um we should start working

414
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
with lascal

415
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,360
there are some changes and then

416
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,039
okay is

417
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,000
that was me um sorry to interrupt daniel

418
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,960
um

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,880
yeah there's some some changes still

420
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,880
pending also from my side

421
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,679
um uh first of all um the spec still

422
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,080
includes the old definition of the

423
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,039
fractional i calendar parameter that we

424
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
want to introduce

425
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,280
i need to change that to the to the new

426
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,159
format that we discussed on the mailing

427
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,200
list

428
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,600
um also i think

429
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,960
we should we should wait until also we

430
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,080
have verified the

431
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,400
js calendar to i calendar translation

432
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,439
um for example i'm not sure we are

433
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,360
covering the

434
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,200
preservation of um of ids

435
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,280
yet probably but that's something we

436
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,799
might need to add for

437
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,520
cheaper calendars spec then um

438
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,200
so yeah i also need to cross check this

439
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,600
back with what we are currently doing at

440
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,000
fast me so

441
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,719
a couple of weeks might be a bit too

442
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,760
eager

443
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,240
uh probably by the end of the year

444
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,679
or january um i think it's more

445
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
realistic

446
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,240
yeah it's likely you know in the in the

447
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,360
end much as i'd like to see it go faster

448
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
um given that it you know the

449
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,479
the very practical nature of it it's

450
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,559
worth having at least a couple of

451
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,080
implementations that can

452
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,120
um successfully um

453
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,399
transfer in both directions even if with

454
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,120
only themselves

455
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
it'd be great to test across more than

456
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,479
one

457
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:39,280
um service if only between say

458
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,520
uh beadwork and and and fast mail

459
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,879
yeah so it's sounding to me like we we

460
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,160
might be doing the working group last

461
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,400
call for this one

462
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,280
um in the lead up to or at next iatf

463
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,840
in march next year that seem reasonable

464
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
yeah

465
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,320
or what we can do also is um

466
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,440
have a long working group last call

467
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,399
um so when the doc is when the specs are

468
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,120
ready uh and then we focus on the

469
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
implementations

470
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,918
yeah there's probably not much point

471
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
doing it while we're still expecting

472
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,559
churn

473
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,960
um because we don't want too many people

474
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,080
to

475
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,120
to review it before it's tested

476
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,960
okay good so yeah i don't think this

477
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,120
this any advantage during a working

478
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,240
group last call

479
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,239
early and having it long

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,600
yeah i've at least got it working with

481
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,039
my own

482
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,199
implementation in one direction and

483
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,320
you know i ran into this issue going the

484
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,919
other direction

485
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,678
and just doing it that way at least gets

486
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,520
one thing working and then we can try

487
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,559
cross server

488
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,320
and and at that point there shouldn't be

489
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,520
an enormous amount of churn it'll be

490
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,520
details that we're dealing with

491
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,360
okay all right um anything else to

492
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,400
discuss on this or should we move on to

493
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,719
all the rest of mike's drafts with these

494
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,520
slides

495
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
yeah well some of this covers some of

496
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,440
what we've already

497
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,440
um gone but if you can yeah we'll start

498
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:35,039
with series

499
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:38,000
um and another

500
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,559
not uh i mean i i went back through some

501
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,760
of the

502
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,200
the comments there weren't as many

503
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,080
comments as i thought there were but it

504
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
was mostly

505
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:49,199
between neil and martin um

506
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,840
but i think um i'm gonna have to make a

507
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,559
few

508
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,600
significant changes to the draft uh as a

509
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,158
result

510
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,678
and adding some sort of mastic component

511
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,039
rather than there

512
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,720
which actually makes a lot of sense

513
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,000
because then

514
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,679
the generated uh instances will stand

515
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,360
alone and be and

516
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
things that don't understand any of this

517
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,479
will just completely ignore the um

518
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,719
the the master component

519
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,679
and all they'll see is a bunch of um

520
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,600
generated

521
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,720
instances which look like real events

522
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,600
anyway so that they should be fine

523
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,720
um so i quite like the idea it makes

524
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,719
makes a lot of sense um

525
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,720
the next slide i think with the

526
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,080
the other part of the argument was about

527
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,559
um

528
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,120
whether we should reuse r rule or s rule

529
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,360
and

530
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,439
um i'm still i'm leaning on these

531
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,719
on having an s rule for a couple of

532
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,240
reasons

533
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
um while

534
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,799
that it does it does it does allow for

535
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,440
some possibilities that

536
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,440
that while they're more they're they're

537
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,799
sort of complex in a way that you don't

538
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
have to do that

539
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:05,760
and there's also the issue of um

540
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,679
having some extra parameters and things

541
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,158
added to the s rule which um

542
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,799
i think just it just makes sense to have

543
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
it i think

544
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,559
as a separate property it's not

545
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,240
that more much more complex if at all

546
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,840
more complex it's a different property

547
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,919
with a different name but

548
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,199
almost exactly the same semantics as our

549
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,159
rule so

550
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,360
um if you can process our rule you can

551
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,760
process s rule

552
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,840
uh it's just there's an extra few

553
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,520
parameters that are legal

554
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,520
so i i think i'll keep it as it stands

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
i'm inclined to agree with that uh for

556
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,279
the reason that it is always

557
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,960
easier to combine two different things

558
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,720
that behave the same than it is to

559
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,320
disambiguate between

560
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,400
two things that look the same but are

561
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,760
different yes exactly

562
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,240
and and i i quite like uh martin's

563
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,760
i hadn't thought of the of the um issue

564
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,880
of mixing recurrences

565
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,240
and uh and and this series that having a

566
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,799
series of recurrences

567
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,799
actually why not if you want to have it

568
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,480
then and you understand the complexity

569
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,039
then go ahead and do it

570
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
um and and for things that don't even

571
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,320
understand this

572
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,640
it's just another set of recurrences

573
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,639
that happen to pop up regularly

574
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
um so uh i think i think i'm sticking

575
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,559
with

576
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,919
with that and so mostly it's it's a

577
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,158
matter of adding in the

578
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,320
issues with um the com the new

579
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,240
components so i need to add that

580
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,279
i'll hopefully get a new draft out

581
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,279
fairly soon without him

582
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,039
next slide excellent

583
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,639
unless there's any comments i mean yeah

584
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,840
new draft zoom

585
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,039
and and now i got my libraries updated

586
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,158
i'm hoping i can

587
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,158
actually get it implemented

588
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,000
cool um i guess we'll probably want

589
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,240
another implementation as well

590
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,720
oh yes i don't want but at least if i

591
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,600
can get

592
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,200
uh icarl4j updated anybody who's doing

593
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,559
java can

594
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,559
use that and um

595
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,279
yeah have you have you talked anyone

596
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,799
else into

597
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,600
having a go at it yet not yet

598
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,080
i guess that's uh something to to stop

599
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,080
pushing on

600
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
ken

601
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,918
apparently add whatever pieces are

602
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,679
needed to levikal

603
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,760
i don't know if we actually have any use

604
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,960
case for it at fast melt

605
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,960
yet yeah it'd be nice to

606
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,240
um for many people is

607
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
is it's it's not easy to slip in my

608
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,000
situation with the public event system

609
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,559
uh i can simply switch to using it and

610
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,600
know we'll know the difference

611
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,120
it'll just make things probably run a

612
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,520
little faster

613
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
and

614
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,639
so i i can certainly put into into into

615
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,880
use

616
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,880
without it being uh an issue

617
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,000
yeah i guess i mean the challenge always

618
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,520
is

619
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,200
when when does the series

620
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,600
apply when does when does it generate

621
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
the new events if the server is doing it

622
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
then

623
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,279
it needs to have some rule to know when

624
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,879
to when to trigger off

625
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,640
a generation event and create that's not

626
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,919
that's that's an optional part of it as

627
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,520
well i mean you can you could

628
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,279
do the same as you do with recurrences

629
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,480
and generate the entire lot if it

630
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:50,080
if it makes sense to do so um

631
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
uh the the um that that was to cover

632
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,000
some

633
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,520
thoughts that cyrus has had over the

634
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,440
years and certainly if you're booking

635
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,320
resources as well

636
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,360
uh through this then not generating any

637
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,918
further than there is

638
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,479
then you can book in the resources makes

639
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,799
sense

640
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,919
but yeah there's a lot of business logic

641
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,918
probably wrapped around yeah

642
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,199
yeah the business logic is going to be

643
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,200
the tricky bit the deciding when the

644
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,559
generation runs and how frequently to

645
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
check for it and all that kind of stuff

646
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,240
but

647
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,520
that's fine cool okay um

648
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,960
should we move on yep um well we've

649
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,320
we've

650
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,760
um something did come up in on the list

651
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,240
in event pub and um and and

652
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,320
most of the issues i think were is

653
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,679
julian who

654
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,600
sent a fairly long message about various

655
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:47,279
aspects of event pub which um

656
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,879
mostly typographical errors of one kind

657
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,440
or another

658
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,880
um can you move on to the next slide

659
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,919
there i think i can't

660
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,919
have myself where we were so

661
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,279
yeah we've already dealt with this yeah

662
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,600
we're waiting for response from the

663
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,720
thing and then that message from dillian

664
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,760
and the question was he had on the next

665
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,279
slide as the

666
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,720
relevant one and

667
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,960
he had some comment which i didn't

668
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,559
think his comment was termed this

669
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,279
structured data thing into a component

670
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,158
which didn't

671
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,960
make a great deal of sense to me but it

672
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
did make me

673
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,960
think that um

674
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,480
recasting the structured location as a v

675
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,440
location component

676
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,919
actually made a lot of sense in that it

677
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,880
dealt with some of the issues

678
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,840
of the concerns about how you deal with

679
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,720
things like the

680
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,959
um the v card reference

681
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,559
if it had a structured data compo

682
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,799
property inside it

683
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,399
which referenced the v card um

684
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,158
there's a lot of history with this what

685
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,320
it was trying to avoid doing was

686
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,080
essentially transporting all of the v

687
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,158
card properties into i calendar

688
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,279
it just didn't make a lot of sense to do

689
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
that so

690
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
one way to do that was to reference a v

691
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,679
card

692
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,200
um because way back when this all

693
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,320
started to start off as v

694
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,720
venue uh it was

695
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
just a reflection of v card inside i

696
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
calendar

697
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,080
and that didn't make any any real sense

698
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,000
when you already have that

699
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,879
object at that time we didn't have

700
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,919
structured data as a um

701
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,880
as a as a an idea it was cyrus to keep

702
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,720
with that

703
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
much later in the life of this whole

704
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,240
draft

705
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,279
i inherited structured data from cyrus

706
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:45,039
and um it

707
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,360
does make a lot of sense to to turn

708
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,200
location into a component put structured

709
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,678
data inside that

710
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,240
which could then which could have the v

711
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,159
card

712
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,039
ref as a as a data uri

713
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,919
to avoid having to download it at that

714
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,919
point in time

715
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,360
i hate to be turning the thing at this

716
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,960
late stage but um

717
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,439
[Music]

718
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,080
i i think it it's it's what what's

719
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
happened is

720
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,199
getting over this psychological blockage

721
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
is it

722
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,640
we always avoided creating new

723
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:28,240
components

724
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:32,240
yeah having done so for participants

725
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,919
it makes it's um it requires a bunch of

726
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
changes to libraries which couldn't cope

727
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,559
with

728
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,520
with multiple depths of components but

729
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,200
uh

730
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,440
having got over that um it matches

731
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,679
better to what we're doing with say js

732
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,559
calendar for com for locations

733
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,840
where they are essentially a component

734
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
rather than a property

735
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,799
so what do we want to do

736
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
like this has already been submitted for

737
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,559
publication do we

738
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,799
pull it back and edit it and resubmit it

739
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,799
again

740
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,518
well i i think that's

741
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,399
sorry i i don't see that as a big big

742
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,919
problem

743
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:30,840
um to change that i mean if we think

744
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,279
it's a better approach

745
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:39,279
um i think i can do this fairly quickly

746
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,360
it's it's um and and

747
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
probably probably within what day is it

748
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,320
today

749
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,320
within a few days i think i can get

750
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,039
another draft out with this with this in

751
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,000
it

752
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,000
it it's um

753
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,120
you know if if i'd had structured data

754
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,880
from the start

755
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,799
i think this is what i would at the

756
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,159
point where i i decided to go with

757
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,879
participant i think i would have done

758
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
this from the

759
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,399
from that point it makes such an it's

760
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,519
such an obvious uh thing to do in the

761
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,080
end

762
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,240
um i think um and it's not just location

763
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,199
it's the other it's the other structured

764
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,919
resources like

765
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,200
the the resource one sorry is is the

766
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,159
same

767
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,360
is the same kind of thing a resource is

768
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,960
often referenced as a v

769
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,199
card or whatever um

770
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,320
what this allows you to do is to put the

771
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,240
is to put

772
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,840
multiple structured data if you want in

773
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,559
there which which reference the thing in

774
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,039
different

775
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,519
ways you know here's a here's an html

776
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,279
rendering of the thing or whatever

777
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,080
so so there's there's a lot of

778
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,480
advantages to to doing this

779
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,480
um and i don't think i should pass it up

780
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,360
barry what do you

781
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
we're think about the event pub document

782
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,880
here

783
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,679
yes yep the one that's been sitting for

784
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,679
400 days

785
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,240
you think that the changes you're

786
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,279
talking about here

787
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,279
are are not going to require

788
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:24,960
further review and consensus

789
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:28,080
beyond what we already have

790
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,120
i i don't think they would um yeah yeah

791
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,840
it's one impression then

792
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,399
i mean it's you're gonna need another

793
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,678
another

794
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,879
uh update to the docket to the um

795
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,519
draft anyway yes so

796
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,399
if you if you want to include these

797
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
changes in that

798
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,240
i think yeah yeah most the other changes

799
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,399
are

800
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,760
i mean virtually all of our as

801
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,080
addressing dillian's comments

802
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,120
as i say a lot of them were just

803
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,240
typographical

804
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:07,840
issues and consistency so um

805
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,840
this was the only standout yeah

806
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,319
yeah i mean i would say when you let's

807
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,480
wait for

808
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,200
get this queued up but wait for um

809
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
respond to my response and make whatever

810
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,000
change

811
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,599
that you want to make for that wait for

812
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,918
ben's response

813
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,960
and then put out another revision of the

814
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,598
id

815
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,599
and let's see where that takes us okay

816
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,520
i think i would ask that you send a

817
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,719
description of

818
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,560
of what you're going to do to the

819
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,158
mailing list today just so that people

820
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,199
have a chance to see it

821
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,760
um but i think otherwise it's fine

822
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,799
yeah okay i can i can do that ahead of

823
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,760
time and say um

824
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,200
it'll be essentially a response to uh i

825
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,000
already sent a response to

826
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,839
julian on his comments but uh i left

827
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,119
this sort of hanging so i'll send

828
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,839
another response saying

829
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,680
what i'm thinking of doing with this

830
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:08,320
this particular point

831
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,319
okay moving on then i guess

832
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:17,359
cool um

833
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:20,480
oh yes subscription upgrade

834
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,240
this this i think is uh is actually um

835
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
yeah just just move to the next slide

836
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,479
there

837
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,880
um there's no not much change it was

838
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,599
it's it really i think having we went

839
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,119
we've been

840
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,119
through the thing and i don't think any

841
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,359
major um

842
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,359
issues have been raised other than um

843
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,200
what's what's the big advantage of this

844
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,000
and i think um

845
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,078
the big advantage we we um we were sort

846
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,599
of highlighting the wrong advantage

847
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,440
and um i never actually incorporated

848
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,480
into the text the big advantage seems to

849
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,800
be for mobile

850
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,800
and that if you can reduce the amount of

851
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,240
traffic going on

852
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,760
uh network traffic then that that

853
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,319
always improves battery life um

854
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,160
and that's that i think is the big thing

855
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,920
with with this i mean if you've got

856
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,279
two biggest devices touring each other

857
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,320
over a huge network what's the

858
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,720
difference

859
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,599
but over when it's a mobile device not

860
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,560
downloading an

861
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,359
entire multi-megabyte ics thing so you

862
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,560
can get about one percent of it

863
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,000
seems to be a good deal

864
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,960
so um i think that i i just need to

865
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,880
change the

866
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,240
finish off the text and resubmit

867
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,920
and then we can go from there and again

868
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,839
i'll try and get that done this

869
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,839
coming week

870
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,960
cool um i think realistically i should

871
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,640
just call a working group last call on

872
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,480
the new draft when it's uploaded

873
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,759
i don't think i think we're basically

874
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,839
done

875
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,960
i think so i don't think there's any

876
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,279
major issues with it

877
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,280
um

878
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,240
okay cool

879
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,598
any any further to that anyone want to

880
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,479
want to object to the

881
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:15,680
the plan suggest a different plan

882
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,000
not all right

883
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,000
vpol is the final slide we have here

884
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,960
and the

885
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,160
i think um there's there's still

886
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,760
issues with this draft um

887
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,960
as regards the itip interactions

888
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,480
um i made some

889
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,720
fairly heavy changes to it to replace

890
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,880
the um we had a v-voter component

891
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,480
in there which has been replaced with

892
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,119
the the participant

893
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,160
component that's in the um event pub

894
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,560
draft

895
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,680
an extension to that so this relies on

896
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,720
the event pub

897
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,319
thing going through um

898
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,560
this is a much better approach because

899
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
it's more compatible with where we

900
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,078
we're going with js calendar and and

901
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,520
things so so i think it'll make

902
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,440
that easier in the future um

903
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,800
and and so we just need to look it over

904
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,040
and and

905
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,119
fix up our implementations and make sure

906
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,960
that things are

907
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,359
work as well as we we think they will um

908
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,200
i've got an implementation ken's gonna

909
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,040
try and get his going i think

910
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,720
at some point we want to try and test it

911
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,480
all again but

912
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,319
um i think it's much better and and

913
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,839
we've had the eye tip issues outstanding

914
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,880
for a while they need tidying up

915
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,240
is um make sure that that

916
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,040
that's uh that's done

917
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,479
cool it's a big document so it's quite a

918
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
lot of work

919
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,640
yeah this one doesn't sound like it's

920
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,880
going to be done before mid next year

921
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,078
i wouldn't think so there's no um

922
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,480
there's no

923
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,400
there's no uh no no it's not gonna and

924
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,960
then i think we want to try and do a js

925
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,640
calendar

926
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,640
version of the ambulance as well so

927
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,400
i think that's it on my part

928
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,320
cool that's all that we have

929
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,359
other than reviewing um

930
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,200
now milestones so

931
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,200
if we glance across at those

932
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,560
we were supposed to submit the alarm

933
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,160
which is still

934
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,440
waiting um i'm just going to note this

935
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,440
down as we go through them so

936
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:47,440
v alarm hopefully to december uh

937
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,440
js calendar has been submitted so

938
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,320
nice done uh scheduling controls is

939
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
waiting on me and i haven't done

940
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,280
anything on it

941
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,520
at all i guess since we've got a few few

942
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,240
minutes to talk about that

943
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
the deal with this document is that it

944
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,759
just

945
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,839
adds a new header

946
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,839
yeah there you go i've let it expire too

947
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,319
but the main thing was there's an

948
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,599
options extension to say that we can

949
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,000
do scheduling controls

950
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,359
and then given that you can then say

951
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,920
whether scheduling is

952
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,640
all non-internal external only etc all

953
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,319
this

954
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,560
it's probably a little bit more complex

955
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,720
than we need the main use case for this

956
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,119
is to say scheduling none and that's

957
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,520
when you're importing data into a caldav

958
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,119
server that's come from somewhere else

959
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,680
and you don't want scheduling messages

960
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,520
to be sent out for it even if it would

961
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,040
normally schedule we discussed this

962
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,440
at cal connect at google

963
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,040
a year and a half ago or so they do

964
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,200
something vaguely similar

965
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,040
internal oh great my phone heard me say

966
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,919
the magic g word

967
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,079
um they did something similarly with

968
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,040
their server internally

969
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,839
yeah it was it was recording my text

970
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,839
it's your hotline is it google

971
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,040
it's always great when i'm on a call

972
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,880
with alexei and uh my echo thinks that i

973
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,759
said it

974
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,800
yeah yeah look at at this stage he

975
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,160
basically needs to change his name

976
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,160
it's like if your name's isis

977
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,560
just to be honest if your name's karen

978
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,119
it's probably time to change it anyway

979
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,920
these days

980
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:43,040
it's it's rough um

981
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,960
i'm happy to to refresh this again

982
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,680
i think there is some value in it i just

983
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,359
keep not getting around to it

984
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,040
i don't know whether i should radically

985
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,799
simplify it i don't know whether we need

986
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,920
to have

987
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,280
the options response or whether we just

988
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:03,040
say try it and see um

989
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,400
another option sorry yes

990
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,839
i can't remember discussing this but

991
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,520
apple has some unpublished uh draft for

992
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,160
bulk upload

993
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,800
does this have any relevance yeah bulk

994
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,160
upload

995
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,920
is a post to the collection i think

996
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,520
um and you can do that you can do

997
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,960
scheduling yeah ken probably knows more

998
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,720
than i do

999
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,720
yeah i was going to say that there

1000
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,119
they would be compatible with one

1001
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,319
another so yes you could use apple's

1002
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,400
bulk import and use this header

1003
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,520
so that as you're importing all the

1004
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,640
various events you're not

1005
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,720
uh blasting out invitations that the

1006
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,720
user priority has sent previously

1007
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,839
now there is an even simpler way to do

1008
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,400
this which is the schedule reply header

1009
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:55,359
we could just say that the schedule

1010
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
reply header

1011
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,759
applies to all scheduling not just

1012
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,480
schedule reply so if you set it to false

1013
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,280
then the server should ignore it for all

1014
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,079
things not just for replies

1015
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,000
and that would that would mean that it

1016
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,880
works in the fallback case for a server

1017
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,880
that

1018
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,480
doesn't support any of this at least for

1019
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,680
that case so you wouldn't have to send

1020
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,079
two headers

1021
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,200
um but it would for a server that does

1022
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,119
support

1023
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,480
suppressing scheduling it would it would

1024
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,440
allow you to suppress it with that

1025
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,839
header

1026
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,960
even for things where you're the

1027
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,119
organizer but it doesn't give as much

1028
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,680
control as this document does

1029
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:33,680
with its internal only external only all

1030
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,000
that magic that allows you to

1031
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,440
to give more controls over scheduling so

1032
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,839
i don't know

1033
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,839
any opinions one way or the other

1034
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,279
i don't have any opinions off the top of

1035
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,680
my head i might have to think about it a

1036
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,839
little bit

1037
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
cool

1038
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,200
yeah i'm happy with either or nothing

1039
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,119
but it is we certainly we are using this

1040
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,960
internally within our caldav sync stuff

1041
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,359
at fast now and it's not

1042
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,520
it's not as it's written here it's some

1043
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,319
other stuff that i wrote earlier

1044
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,839
and this was to try and make it a bit

1045
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,880
more regularized

1046
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,400
but obviously we would use this if we if

1047
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,839
we standardized it

1048
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,240
you know who might be worth um engaging

1049
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:36,160
this

1050
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,040
is is hence yoga who does

1051
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,598
um given that there's this this um big

1052
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,480
push in

1053
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,680
in the eu to do um allow people to

1054
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,440
import and export their data

1055
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,160
um i think standardizing that process

1056
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,480
makes a lot of sense and it may not just

1057
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,240
be

1058
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,079
um a uh i mean

1059
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,919
having something that makes sense with

1060
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,400
multiple protocols or you know

1061
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,920
that at least the semantics are the same

1062
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,599
makes sense you you want to pull it out

1063
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,200
of a cal diver where things shove it

1064
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,079
into a js calendar

1065
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,279
thing uh jay's map thing it's gonna be

1066
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,079
um

1067
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,640
so it might be worth engaging hence yoga

1068
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,160
that's

1069
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,640
cool all right

1070
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,160
um and it's partly his business as well

1071
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,078
as moving data around in

1072
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,078
large amounts yeah

1073
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,839
i will do that

1074
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:47,280
uh next on our actions list sorry just

1075
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:51,279
to

1076
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,880
pop back out of here ico relations we

1077
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,400
