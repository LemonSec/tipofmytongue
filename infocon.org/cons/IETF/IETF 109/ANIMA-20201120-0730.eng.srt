powerpoint slideshow

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,799

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,040

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,360
enema working group meeting

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,719
um standard disclaimer right

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
please mute your cell phones and

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
all the other things about the itf

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,320
notewell

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,879
i think we don't need to go through this

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,879
in detail

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,039
so yep

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,640
uh i'm not sure if we have an explicit

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,840
jabber scribe anybody who

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,799
who's following would would would be

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,439
lovely to help and basically reflect any

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,840
possible

24
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,600
questions from people who cannot get on

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,000
the microphone line itself

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,679
i think shang will primarily take care

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,720
of the microphone line as i'm sharing

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
the slides

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,000
joanna is going to take the minutes and

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,880
the other thing should be well known all

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
right let's

32
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,439
get directly into it um so we have um

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,439
cluster c 325

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,439
with all the documents in it um

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,960
not being blocked on anything but rfc

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,199
editor

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,759
so that it means the uh anima grasp

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
uh the prefix management reference model

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,399
bootstrapping and autonomic control

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,479
plane we're still

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,600
getting updates on these two uh

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
documents as

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,839
they still had worked since the last itf

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,640
um the cluster also has

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,280
other documents in it which uh you know

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,640
because

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,240
by virtue of being linked to grasp but

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,479
they're not really from our working

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,478
group

50
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:16,399
so that's the main you know round one of

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,920
anima charter finishing up so

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,959
there's also the grasp api

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
and that's going to be on the telechat

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
in

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,559
december so it has enough positions to

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
pass so that would also go into the

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
cluster

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
um there was a

59
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,760
an update from the authors i'm going to

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
quickly show on the next slide but

61
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,679
otherwise no presentation here

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
then we have the working group documents

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,920
in their way into the working group

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
so there are the asa guidelines from the

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,079
individual

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,120
draft 09 so that was adopted

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
by the working group on mid this month

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
um so i've assigned myself as the

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,680
shepard um

70
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,959
and um i haven't actually checked in the

71
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
last few days if i

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
i think brian had put put put in a

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,400
version zero zero

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,959
i'm sorry i didn't update that in the

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,959
slide um

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,000
so then we have uh the draft vendor

77
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,239
stock um

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
so shang was doing the adoption call for

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,480
that uh please provide more feedback i'm

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,480
not sure

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,720
what's the latest status of that of that

82
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,720
chain

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,599
we should um already pass the

84
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,599
adoption code because we don't have any

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,040
you know any objections

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,080
on that but i have to

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,159
uh give a reminder for the

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,040
other and other participants as well

89
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,760
because there are little uh discussion

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
for

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,079
this document for a while i can fully

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
understand that because

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,200
you know uh this document already be

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,720
around

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,319
for a while uh but as cheer we actually

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,840
would like to see

97
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,839
more discussing in the mailing list

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,280
could please the others support

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,959
the new working group document

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,918
with their zero version but try to

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
invoke more discussing in the mainlines

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,758
we need to see

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,840
progress from now on thank you yeah

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,400
and also i guess that this stuff came

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,479
from a particular iot area so

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,520
one of the ways on how to get more

107
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
feedback for these

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
type of working group documents is also

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
when we work with the authors and

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,000
suggest

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,599
presenting this bringing this up on the

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,919
actual you know mailing list of the

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,240
working groups that would use this stuff

114
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,560
you know could even be ops area you know

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,880
i guess once we have the iot

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,400
ops working group uh those things might

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,479
be brought in there as well for

118
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
for further review and feedback from

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,919
outside the

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,198
the core enema protocol specification

121
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,400
group

122
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,199
okay then

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,758
we have brewski as essence and roll

124
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
we'll get an

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
update in this meeting that was adopted

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
after 107

127
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
and then we have the constraint voucher

128
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,280
uh for which there is a design team

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,880
formed after 108 also an update

130
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,239
uh we've got grass distribution um

131
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,800
and uh since uh 108

132
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
there was some essential content merged

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
from

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,800
um the grass bulk documents so the

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,600
authors have been doing work but

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,560
we've been also running out of time so

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
there is no

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
no update given in this meeting but

139
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,919
check out the the latest version

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,719
okay draft anima grasp api given how

141
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,479
that's uh

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,680
going to be on its way out

143
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,599
uh so the uh the list of changes here

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
um so pretty significant good

145
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,759
improvements from

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,638
from from the review i'm not going to

147
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,280
read that out

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,600
in more detail if anybody has questions

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,679
or so please come to the mic and

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:10,639
we can answer them here in this slot

151
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,000
i hope otherwise let's move on

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,919
so non-working group documents we've got

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,039
the anima voucher delegation

154
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,080
that was updated after 108 so that's

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,240
pending for adoption

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,758
calls so well we'll do that adoption

157
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,160
call after

158
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,639
um uh this uh ietf meeting

159
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,639
uh we've got the uh only non-working

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,400
group item that made it onto the agenda

161
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
for this time that's the brewski cloud

162
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,479
that's going to be discussed

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,359
um and then there are three uh further

164
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,159
documents

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
uh that we discussed in 108 for which we

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
haven't heard

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
update i guess it might be something

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,599
like work overflow

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
on behalf of the authors so i'm assuming

170
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,560
that unless you know one of the authors

171
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,880
may want to step forward and say

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
something about them

173
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,639
yeah and any other interest or so please

174
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,240
come to the mic

175
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,759
during this slot and uh note anything

176
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,599
we've we've forgotten on the work

177
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:10,400
side so um other business

178
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
um so i mentioned the iot ops working

179
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,080
group that actually was discussed the

180
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
first uh you know direction toward the

181
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,639
charter just in before in

182
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,080
the ops area uh meeting i'm not sure if

183
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,000
you attended that so hopefully that's

184
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,080
going to come down and it's going to be

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,599
hopefully good adjacency for for use

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,840
cases scenarios

187
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:33,280
and so on no standards were planned

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,359
with enema and

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,559
i was making my concern that you know

190
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
iot is is

191
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,240
is kind of is a strange term but

192
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
um i think routers and switches uh you

193
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,960
know

194
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,919
also have very much the same life cycle

195
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,239
issues so

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
we should be you know inclusive of of

197
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,039
those devices as well even if

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,159
iot people often don't think about them

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,878
um i was giving in a presentation about

200
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
uh you know

201
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,800
how grasp should be great to do fairly

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,359
pragmatic automation

203
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,759
um with asas in routing working group

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,800
which came up because there was this

205
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,479
pep protocol proposed and so hopefully

206
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,199
the pep

207
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,919
authors are going to consider focusing

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,319
on the

209
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,919
actual um you know applications that

210
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,319
they were suggesting like

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,159
automation of operational aspects of

212
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
routing protocols because those would be

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
great

214
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,280
asas to bring into enema um that was the

215
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,159
gist of it otherwise

216
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,399
please check out the slides about you

217
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
know how to use grasp for asa

218
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,559
i think that was very well received in

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,479
the working group

220
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,559
um tooling reminder if if you're getting

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,159
into enema at this point in time and

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,880
don't know how to operate

223
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,640
um if you if you want to bring documents

224
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,760
in and want to have them edited

225
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:52,399
more easily by other members of the team

226
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,160
use the the github that we have for a

227
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,200
long time

228
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
and then um

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
we're done with the chair slides and

230
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,719
given how you know

231
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,839
the time 10 minutes okay i'm still good

232
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,839
in the time

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,839
um any uh further question on this slot

234
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,800
okay fine let me check to that

235
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,839
okay all right so let me swap over to

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,479
the next slot

237
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,399
which is the acp update so let me see

238
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,600
that i'm

239
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,920
publishing the screen yes

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,200
and then let me just share the entire

241
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,479
screen i think that's easier

242
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,920
so hopefully

243
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,519
let's check again do you folks see my

244
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,519
acp update full screen

245
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
hello

246
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:01,120
excellent thank you all right so

247
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,920
we were at 28 after itf-108

248
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
so the majority of the time was actually

249
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,839
spent

250
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,839
with the isg final reviews uh for

251
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:14,240
uh that 29 i converted to xml v3 which

252
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,279
is i think recommended for every

253
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,320
document now

254
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,360
to speed up rfc editor pass because they

255
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,360
they need uh xmlv3 i also did it because

256
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,279
i put

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,800
pascal michael and brian into

258
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,279
contributors and

259
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,959
that only has formal xml tags in version

260
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,519
three

261
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,800
so 29 closed all the remaining discusses

262
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,880
from the isg

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,359
roman ben and barry um

264
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,079
it also closed all the comments from the

265
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,839
isg

266
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,439
so um maybe some quick highlights that i

267
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,040
felt might be you know technically

268
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,640
interesting so there was

269
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,040
a uh good two more pages of

270
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,319
uh security considerations from the

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,439
questions raised from

272
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,440
the security reviewers um so

273
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
core things that we you know as the

274
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
authors all have been taking for granted

275
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,200
but then couldn't find

276
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,480
good references to point to either such

277
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,120
as you know that

278
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
idfid and ldfid need to be protected

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
from private key extraction through

280
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
mechanisms like tpm

281
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
or others and that attacks against the

282
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,480
software

283
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
of course can impact the security of the

284
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
acp so you want to have

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,920
hardware with secure boot and software

286
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,040
upgrade

287
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,160
the registrars and the est protocol of

288
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,279
course are you know

289
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,160
one of the core attack vectors um so

290
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,760
it's quite important to make sure that

291
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
only the registrars have the

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
this tag in the certificate that gives

293
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,160
them the

294
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,760
authorization to be registrar so that

295
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,600
not every device could be

296
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,079
hacked to become a registrar um

297
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,160
and then i think uh you know the the

298
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,800
remainder of the security considerations

299
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
are really

300
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
the ones also applicable to est nothing

301
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,199
new otherwise

302
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,359
the men in the middle attacks the acp is

303
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,000
fairly well protected against that

304
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,040
uh discussed how the grass discovery of

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,680
est

306
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,560
could be a problem but i think concluded

307
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
it cannot be

308
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,880
so i think that's very useful to show

309
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,839
that there has been a very thorough

310
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,800
security analysis of the acp security

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
model

312
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
um

313
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,680
ben brought up the point about the um

314
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,839
well-known port

315
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,439
the the port numbers in dull grasp

316
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,920
during discovery of neighbors

317
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
um i refined that to explain how that's

318
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,040
a possible attack vector we were

319
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,000
discussing this and didn't have these

320
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
port numbers five years

321
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,160
ago when we started so they sneaked in

322
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,920
later on because we were looking into

323
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,719
dtls

324
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,160
so that's still you know something um

325
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,320
which

326
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
people cannot fully agree that you know

327
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,639
well known port numbers are a good way

328
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,680
to avoid this uh problem but obviously

329
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,680
once we would see

330
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,680
that for dtls this would become a

331
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,239
problem we could go forward and

332
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,079
ask for an acp over dtls well-known port

333
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
number two to avoid that

334
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,439
problem but given how right now we're

335
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,120
focusing on ipsec

336
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,360
i think uh we shouldn't be worried about

337
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,399
this um

338
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,760
yeah formatting as cbor cddl um

339
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,760
finally i hope we've got all the

340
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,600
extension points ready so that

341
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,279
we're doing extensions to the acp

342
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,040
both in the certificate and other places

343
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,880
that we're not going to run into issues

344
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,760
and also don't even need to

345
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,639
necessarily do any updates and are fully

346
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,639
backward compatible

347
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,199
well remember starting out uh

348
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,800
grasp uh by outsourcing the security

349
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,719
into acp so i think

350
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,040
uh we now got um in um

351
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
the new section six one a good summary

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
of you know i think the

353
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,639
the really good profile on how to use

354
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,760
tls for things like acp obviously this

355
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,440
for the acp

356
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,920
should be good reference when others run

357
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,880
into this very long process figuring out

358
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,680
what exactly a minimum profile and

359
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,439
requirement

360
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,638
text might be so and then

361
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,720
there is a new section 10 9 for a

362
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,560
possible future asa to discover

363
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,440
secure channel downgrade attacks given

364
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,000
how we explicitly want the flexibility

365
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
of multiple

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,440
protocols for the acp we obviously want

367
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
to

368
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
make sure that in case that one of them

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,880
is

370
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,439
the you know least secure one that we

371
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,360
discover when somebody man in the middle

372
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,880
does a downgrade attack there

373
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,639
um so yeah that that was was good uh

374
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,199
time and work uh spent

375
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,880
um then basically when we're done um the

376
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,479
thing went to eric

377
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,160
um and so dash 30 which is now in the

378
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,519
rfc editor queue was kind of the

379
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,680
leftovers run

380
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
um yeah one of one of the problems

381
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,920
obviously is that

382
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,079
um i i've i've been doing the

383
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
the final english check on that one um

384
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,560
it's it's

385
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,720
it's really stupid like i haven't found

386
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
a good spelling checker that

387
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
avoids to repeat the thousand times

388
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,479
non-issues race so that's why i was

389
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
doing it just at the end um there there

390
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,519
are now four sections um

391
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,839
in a new appendix b which are marked

392
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,600
for removal by the rfc editor which is

393
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
capturing the things that

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,440
we either couldn't get agreement on or

395
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,880
where there wasn't enough review

396
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,720
to uh make them safe for the rfc

397
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,480
um the first one is this very old

398
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,800
negotiation via grasp for the um

399
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,759
acp secure channel mechanism i had left

400
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,680
it

401
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:40,000
in the draft before for feedback

402
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,758
from isg actually ben liked it also

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,959
suggested additional text but

404
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,199
still i felt not safe to move it into

405
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,319
the rfc given how we couldn't finish the

406
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,479
text and how the

407
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
working group originally thought it was

408
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,680
too much for

409
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,880
this initial rfc and then the other

410
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,239
three were kind of

411
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,880
uh smaller uh things so one that we

412
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
discussed

413
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,000
very early on as well kind of uh should

414
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,360
the acp address in the forwarding plane

415
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,880
for appear be verified and there is good

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759
discussion about that

417
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,720
but um i don't think we we have given

418
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,079
recently enough

419
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
consideration for that i think the

420
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,519
answer is no um

421
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
then basically i think a very

422
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,880
interesting discussion about

423
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,399
um how would we use acp with public cas

424
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
and well guess what if we had rfc 822

425
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,639
name as before dash

426
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,720
25 it we could use them today so this is

427
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,040
somewhat of a painful topic

428
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,720
and then the hardening of the doll grasp

429
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,120
from the prior slide

430
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,199
so um yeah this we we ended up with the

431
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
normal process so you have to know that

432
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
you know changelog and everything that

433
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,519
didn't make into the rfc

434
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,120
is documented in the last draft to find

435
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,040
these things but at least for us in the

436
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,959
working group when we want to go back

437
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,480
later on and pick up on additional

438
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
things we want to do for acp that's

439
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,079
where it is

440
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,279
right and that's pretty much it so yeah

441
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,638
cluster c2

442
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,400
325 is unlocked so kind of you know

443
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
the the endgame of the dungeon i think

444
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
that's where the rfc editor sits behind

445
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,120
that

446
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,959
big door and uh well thank you very much

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,119
everybody involved especially

448
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,240
you know all the hard work also from the

449
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,399
isg um

450
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,000
in in in all the reviews it took a very

451
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,640
long time but i think it was worth it

452
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
from

453
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,559
you know really the fact that there are

454
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,799
a lot of security related things

455
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,959
around the acp i you know by now i know

456
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,400
a lot more than even brewski itself

457
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,440
so that was definitely well spent

458
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,799
okay that's it any more questions about

459
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,039
that

460
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,240
uh no questions but i just want to chime

461
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,840
in to say a big thank you

462
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,360
tell us for getting this one over the

463
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,199
line uh and the amount of effort you've

464
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,240
put in and the working group

465
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,679
um and also eric's uh helped the

466
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,280
shepherding ad for this so i'd just

467

like to thank everyone i know this has

468
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160

469
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,240
so right what's the presenter oh sorry

470
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,360

this sap document thanks so much for

474
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,440
your hard work we have been very long

475
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,000
process for this document and

476
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,880
after now we can finally call the

477
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,360
victory

478
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,679
for our animal stage one start from

479
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,360
2014 yeah this is the last

480
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,720
document in our stage one and actually

481
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,159
we can together release the five

482
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:40,720
rfcs one of them already being released

483
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,720
for more than thousand days

484
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,760
yeah um and by now actually we hand our

485
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
original autonomic network

486
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,000
infrastructure

487
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,799
uh components three of them all

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,320
published

489
00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,240
uh complete and that including the

490
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,760
sap and reski and grasp

491
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,200
will help you know in this second stage

492
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
we can say more

493
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:16,400
autonomical service agent which use

494
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:20,160
reuse those components as we hope

495
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,080
and then finally we could get our

496
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,200
autonomical network and the services

497
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:31,039
you know be used in the

498
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,840
real world and that makes the network

499
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,879
management and network maintenance much

500
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,799
easier

501
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:42,320
thanks for yeah

502
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,000
all right so

503
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,240
um michael i think you're going to

504
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,039
uh to take this one do you want to just

505
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,600
say next slide

506
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,600
next slide

507
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,520
uh so um it says in august um

508
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
we had a conversation um coming out of

509
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
the

510
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
uh vrsky async and role in the cmp work

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,080
about whether or not

512
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,440
the uh brewski thing should be under est

513
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,840
or not um and after

514
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,200
i guess a fair bit of back and forth we

515
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,120
decided that they

516
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
should ideally because the document was

517
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,320
sitting in auth48

518
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,158
um so uh a

519
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,520
change was prepared um to discuss it

520
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,640
uh there's a the the the difference the

521
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,240
diffs are in that

522
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,720
email that's listed there um

523
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,559
the couple implementers were con were

524
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
contacted and they're all kind of yeah

525
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,879
we can make this change it's not so

526
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
terrible

527
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
um and particularly on the registrar's

528
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
side it's easy to support both so if you

529
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,799
have your own

530
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,360
you know pledge code that you don't want

531
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,520
to update

532
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,280
immediately then you could support the

533
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,840
old names as well as the new names but

534
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,440
going forward we would use the new names

535
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,520
um warren pulled put it into

536
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
a uh we had a working do we have we had

537
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,639
a working group last call i think on

538
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,918
that

539
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,520
um and then we had an ietf last call

540
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,960
that concluded on

541
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,158
september 14th so that was uh

542
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,760
version 44 updated

543
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,559
and that changed some ionic stuff

544
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,120
and a conversation with mark nottingham

545
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,158
occurred

546
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,280
as the well-known reviewer um designated

547
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,960
expert

548
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
so that went okay next slide please

549
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559
um so what does this look like there's

550
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,760
their picture of a thousand words of

551
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,399
differences

552
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
um basically it took some paragraph

553
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,720
couple paragraphs here and there

554
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,280
uh to change it through the thing next

555
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
slide please

556
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,559
okay so then what was that in

557
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,200
mid-october three or four weeks ago

558
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,280
uh taurulis noticed that we didn't have

559
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
we had a missing iana action

560
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,799
for the and proxy in the in joined

561
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,799
registrar um

562
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
which was supposed to be allocated out

563
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,240
of the grasp

564
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,360
registry um and so again we did some

565
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,720
a similar thing um a new document

566
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,678
um the paragraph there at the bottom

567
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,240
you're scrolled a little bit up maybe um

568
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,440
and

569
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,280
uh there we go so that was those two two

570
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
two lines were added to allocate the

571
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,799
thing this went again

572
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,600
had an 80 approval no ietf last call

573
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,080
um it was oops again it was sitting in

574
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,918
the

575
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,799
uh sitting in the rfc editor queue

576
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,840
anyway

577
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,000
so it got updated and uh

578
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,918
went in and ayanna has signed off on

579
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,600
that next slide please

580
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,679
yeah and that was because i was going

581
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,280
through the registry for the acp at that

582
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,400
point in time

583
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,360
yeah so thank you um so uh

584
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,320
uh i keep hoping for auth 48 any like

585
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,120
hour now

586
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,480
uh we up we're at the top of the rfc

587
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,399
editor queue

588
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,400
um so uh um

589
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
i think it's like you know any minute

590
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,320
now any minute now that we'll be in off

591
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,000
48

592
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,240
for that so thank you again for all yeah

593
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,600
so so brian was already mentioning some

594
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,240
activity from from rfc editor on grasp

595
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,760
ah so he's an off 48 then okay no no not

596
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,799
all 48 yet there was some other

597
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,520
indication that they're

598
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:42,639
seemingly already working on something

599
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,639
okay so i assume they're working on it

600
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,159
yeah yeah again it's a target

601
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
down there behind the door so we're not

602
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,200
really sure what's going on we're just

603
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,360
looking at the status of

604
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,520
the cluster so there's a yeah there's a

605
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,760
canadian restaurant that has a really

606
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,600
delicious root beer called brewski

607
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,360
i was gonna acquire some for the

608
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,918
vancouver meeting but

609
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,199
uh like you know a quantity enough for

610
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,039
everyone in the room

611
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:14,799
but that won't happen right um

612
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,799
okay next document then

613
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,039
you can't make it full screen eh well

614
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,440
you know with this pdf stuff i'm never i

615
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,120
could

616
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,840
try i don't know where where is it

617
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,559
uh enter full screen turn off continuous

618
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,840
scroll

619
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,960
continue scroll and then it won't be so

620
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,360
stupid

621
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,480
and you'll be able to page down i hope

622
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,520
yeah

623
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
okay all right uh yeah so constraint

624
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,559
voucher so

625
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,080
um we've been working on this this is

626
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,360
peter um

627
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,279
esko um panos

628
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,479
um a few other people that have come to

629
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,159
the uh

630
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,159
thursday design team meetings um and so

631
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,360
uh this document if you haven't read it

632
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,320
before essentially replaces http with

633
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,918
coap

634
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,439
replaces tls mostly with dtls but also

635
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,240
possibly with

636
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,440
os core and

637
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,640
basically makes it a much more

638
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,679
constrained scenario it uses

639
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,720
yang schema identifiers which are in the

640
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,440
still in the core working group

641
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,760
i believe they've just finally passed

642
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
properly into the isg

643
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,879
and i hope they'll pass through easily

644
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,880
but

645
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,720
we'll see that's probably the critical

646
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,279
thing for this document

647
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,960
um it's not yet obviously critical path

648
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,320
because we're not done with it but

649
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,400
it would be very nice to have that

650
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,879
document finished because

651
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,320
um it was rather difficult to figure out

652
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,400
how do we allocate numbers from a

653
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
registry that isn't yet created

654
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,919
so in fact the document now contains an

655
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,799
allocation for us

656
00:25:49,919 --> 00:26:00,640
there next slide please um

657
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,639
so we've moved it to brewski um

658
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,679
as was discussed in the previous

659
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,080
document uh the shorter versions of that

660
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,720
and we've updated some of the examples

661
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,080
of how

662
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,799
things work um one of the conversations

663
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,559
is that

664
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,600
in co-app you can do a resource

665
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,360
discovery and now the question is

666
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,678
well you could ask for previously you

667
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,520
could ask for est.star

668
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,720
and get all the results back including

669
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,799
the enrollment things if

670
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
they were moved somewhere now you'd have

671
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,918
to do two passes one ask for est

672
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,120
or maybe cmp and then one to ask for

673
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,200
brewski so that may

674
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,799
take two round trips or uh etc so one of

675
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,840
the conversations that we've had

676
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,720
is that the well-known uh

677
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,158
things are are mandatory to implement if

678
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,159
you want to put it elsewhere as

679
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,600
on the registrar if you want to put it

680
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
elsewhere as well

681
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,000
then you can do that and this means that

682
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,440
a client that can

683
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,120
if it wishes can uh skip the discovery

684
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,679
process if it knows where the registrar

685
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,158
is

686
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,760
already the discovery typically could be

687
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,640
for instance multicasted to find out

688
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,919
what registrars are out there

689
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
next slide please

690
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,640
um we have asked the question

691
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,520
uh come back to why are we doing cms

692
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,679
science seaboard that was a request

693
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,639
when we started this document to do this

694
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,000
and

695
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,640
um we don't seem to remember who or why

696
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
wants that and uh it seems really daft

697
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
but

698
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,440
um we're gonna do this uh we're so we

699
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,480
were asking the working group what's

700
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,720
going on

701
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,480
we have some clarifications around the

702
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,520
use of proximity registered

703
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,679
public key info and we have some

704
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,600
interactions

705
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:51,520
with questions about how it deals with a

706
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,199
composite or asynchronous uh registrar

707
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,760
so we meet on there's a design team

708
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,880
meeting on thursdays that it's at 7 30

709

and the the invite is open to the

713
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,679
mailing list

and uh um uh please join us

715
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
next slide yeah maybe send it out again

716
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
it's somewhere

717
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,120
down in in in the mailing list so

718
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,399
reminder is always a good thing once a

719
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,120
quarter

720
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,879
uh yeah so also i will send i owe a

721
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,959
mailing list a summary of

722
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
some of what this is discussed and some

723
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
deeper uh things

724
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,240
um so uh one of the things the

725
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,399
discussions we had

726
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,799
is as you know we have actually next

727
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,840
slide please

728
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,480
we have a pledge next we just guess and

729
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,918
hit down

730
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,600
next we have a registrar and we have a

731
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,279
massa right so you know we have those

732
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,080
three things next slide

733
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,600
um so we wind up with a connection

734
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,199
between the pledge and the registrar

735
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,279
next

736
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
um and we may have a joint proxy in

737
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,200
between there

738
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,639
next slide if you're making a

739
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
presentation by the way and you want

740
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,360
these icons they are in the iot

741
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,159
directorate

742
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,039
uh github as well uh next slide so you

743
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,360
can put a

744
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,720
cozy signed c board and we do this over

745
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,399
co-app so that's what the

746
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,760
that's what this document is about right

747
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,399
mostly okay

748
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,679
um so that's well understood that part

749
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,120
is co-app that part is

750
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,720
is is cozy next slide please

751
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,559
and so then we make a connection from

752
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
the registrar to the mass next slide

753
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,000
um and i proposed some years ago that we

754
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,880
call this one the parboiled

755
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,760
uh voucher request not everyone loved

756
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,000
that term but

757
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,879
no one's proposed something better um

758
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,120
and that

759
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,440
this one would also be cozy sign sivor

760
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,559
and in the prior signed voucher request

761
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,480
would contain the

762
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,320
light purple one that from the left the

763
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,440
code which was in format cosy signed

764
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,080
cbore

765
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,720
next sign and that would occur over

766
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,240
https

767
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,440
not over co-app s and there's a couple

768
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,760
of reasons for this

769
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,919
um one is that it is observed that coap

770
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,720
does not and udp protocols do not get in

771
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,360
and out of

772
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
uh corporate environments that easily um

773
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,678
is one point and the second point is

774
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,678
that

775
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,279
the there is not much experience out

776
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,399
there in the general

777
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,399
um web service population

778
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,918
of building and scaling co-app-based

779
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:19,840
systems whereas

780
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:23,039
http scaling https systems is like

781
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,600
um i'm not saying it's ubiquitous but um

782
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,760
you know you could it's pretty hard not

783
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,959
to bump into people who know a fair bit

784
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,679
about doing that

785
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,399
um in pretty much any any enterprise and

786
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,039
and space

787
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,000
entire entire companies are based upon

788
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,799
doing that

789
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,799
next slide please

790
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,039
so what you get back is a voucher okay

791
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,760
and it's in the format that you asked

792
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,799
for

793
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,640
um and uh i will say that my code

794
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,080
assumed that the voucher format coming

795
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
back should always be the same as the

796
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,120
voucher format that was presented

797
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,799
but actually that's wrong um and it

798
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,879
doesn't really matter in

799
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,240
in the core brewski document what you do

800
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
because we have only one choice but so

801
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
we

802
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,399
putting some clarification in here that

803
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,279
actually the answer is

804
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,239
uh well http has an accept header and

805
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,600
that's what you should be

806
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,519
using to tell what kind of voucher

807
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
format you want back

808
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,799
but also the masa knows because of its

809
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,799
relationship with the pledge

810
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,240
what kind of voucher formats the pledge

811
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,080
can accept

812
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,600
um and so it should send one that the

813
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,600
pledge can accept

814
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,279
but should also consider what the

815
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,559
registrar is asking for because the

816
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,159
registrar would like to

817
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,840
audit it so the registrar can give a

818
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,120
preference but the mass is going to

819
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,959
return the one that the pledge can

820
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,639
actually

821
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,640
process next slide please

822
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,240
um so yeah that's the same point next

823
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,240
slide

824
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,480
so start again here let's think another

825
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,640
way this right

826
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,880
um one proposal was next slide please

827
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,559
uh we have this cosy signed c board as

828
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,840
before next slide

829
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,840
can you just say click that's faster

830
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,519
click

831
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,519
okay so we make the connection click

832
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,960
what if we put a cms sign

833
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
json here so that's what the core

834
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,559
document says

835
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
is you do sign json and there's no

836
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,600
reason why we can't store

837
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,480
the cosy net click

838
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,799
why we can't put the cosy signed seabor

839
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,039
in as the prior sign voucher request

840
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,960
in a cms sign json yes you have to

841
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,320
base64 encode it but you have to do that

842
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,880
anyway for the

843
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,639
uh anyway and the interesting part about

844
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
this is that this means that on the

845
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,000
on the right hand side the registrar

846
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
essentially has

847
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
always sends out the things in the same

848
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,080
pro request

849
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,679
and the mass always processes things in

850
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,360
the same request regardless of whether

851
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,720
it's a constrained or a non-constrained

852
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,959
request

853
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,360
um but of course actually both things

854
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,000
still have to process cosy sign c board

855
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,199
so they're not really getting out of too

856
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,960
many code paths

857
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,960
but maybe there are some code paths we

858
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,559
discussed whether this would make sense

859
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,039
next slide click and again we do that

860
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,320
over https so that's even more

861
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,440
kind of a third level of thought

862
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,120
click and you get a

863
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,120
a a voucher back click

864
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,519
so in this case so we have this

865
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
interesting thing that that

866
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,600
you asked with cms sign json but you got

867
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,760
cozy sign c bar

868
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
click

869
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,840
so um this is the

870
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,960
the case that we more we think basically

871
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,559
we thought we discussed that a fair bit

872
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,080
and we basically decided that that

873
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,440
previous case was dumb

874
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,279
that we didn't like it in particular

875
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,880
it means that a master that only deals

876
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,279
with constrained devices would have to

877
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,200
speak

878
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,480
non-constrained voucher uh request

879
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,559
uh content um and it doesn't remove

880
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,880
really any code paths from the registrar

881
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,200
so click

882
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,320
so we're sticking with this as the model

883
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,919
that you do it this way

884
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,639
okay oh yeah and we could do this over

885
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,399
co-op right as well as the possibility

886
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
and we said that's dumb so we're not

887
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,679
going to do that either

888
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,639
click right so there's the

889
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,639
not doing that click

890
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,560
i'm not doing this click

891
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,240
so just a little bit of a kind of uh uh

892
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,918
summary of these issues right um

893
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,279
about what the different things are and

894
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,118
how it how it does

895
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,440
things and the con consensus that we had

896
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,480
in the in this in the design team was

897
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,599
that

898
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,359
um you will always sign your parboiled

899
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:50,399
voucher request with the same format as

900
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,199
um you received okay so

901
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,960
uh all these other variations are gone

902
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,719
that we will not use coap s

903
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,800
between the registrar and the masa for

904
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,319
the reasons that were um

905
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,839
stated there i think that's the last

906
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,839
slide click

907
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,078
oh yeah okay this is the last slide on

908
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,720
that topic

909
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,760
um so the conversation we had had to do

910
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,359
with

911
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,960
and and i still have a a a long email to

912
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,359
try to explain this in more detail and

913
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,359
to get some text into it

914
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,359
the issue is that one of the ways to

915
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,920
build a scalable registrar

916
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,880
is to separate the southbound the pledge

917
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,320
interface

918
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,440
uh box in the bottom there from the

919
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,839
masa client interface so um you could

920
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,520
have scale the pledge interface

921
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,200
appropriately for the number of devices

922
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,839
that you expect to unroll at any one

923
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,399
time

924
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,000
which i guess at certain times of the

925
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
could be zero and other times maybe

926
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,280
it's thousands and you need to have a a

927
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,439
fair bit more

928
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,640
capability there to do that um and

929
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
that's kind of

930
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,799
kind of typical um you know web-based

931
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,760
scaling things with i don't know

932
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,520
containers and

933
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,119
and orchestration and other stuff like

934
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,640
that there

935
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,200
and then the only real connection from

936
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,520
the bottom which talks to the devices

937
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,118
of the pledges and the thing at the top

938
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
which talks the nasa

939
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,160
is the database so in fact you can build

940
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,520
a system that's a synchronous you put

941
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,200
the voucher request into a database

942
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,359
maybe you send a signal or the database

943
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,799
sends a signal to the master client

944
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,480
and it goes off and talks to the

945
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,920
appropriate masses to get vouchers back

946
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,280
and when you do this kind of thing one

947
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
of the things you realize is that you

948
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760
probably don't want to share the private

949
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,759
key

950
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,040
across all of these devices in fact

951
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,720
there's nothing that stops you from

952
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,400
having a different certificate

953
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,759
on each of those pledge interfaces so

954
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
you can actually spin things up and

955
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,240
given that

956
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,640
they actually in theory can be

957
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,319
self-signed certificates

958
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,000
and as long as they last long enough for

959
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,720
the voucher to pin them there's not

960
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,160
actually a

961
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,680
you could actually destroy them as you

962
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,879
as you destroyed the vm or something

963
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,759
like that you could even do something

964
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
like that

965
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,880
that's not not how i design it but you

966
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,640
could do that

967
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,480
but in that case the question is what

968
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,520
exactly are you pinning

969
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,000
and the answer is in the the

970
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,160
uh non-constrained case where we're

971
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,720
using certificates

972
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,078
the answer is well you should pin the ca

973
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,640
and we have some text

974
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,839
there that that clarifies this and esco

975
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,680
has been very uh

976
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,680
persistent in making it this clarified

977
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,040
and we have some of that relatively well

978
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,078
clarified in the brewski

979
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,400
document as well and that's pretty easy

980
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,480
but in the case where you're using a

981
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,920
self-signed certificate at the bottom

982
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,760
um then there's no ca to deal with this

983
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,800
or a raw public key in the very

984
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,400
constrained case

985
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,680
then what do you do exactly and so

986
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,119
that's what we're kind of trying to

987
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,040
figure out what do we put in there i'm

988
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,490
trying to get that text correct

989
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,040
i think next slide

990
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:43,359
[Music]

991
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,240
right so that was it yeah um so that's

992
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,640
the kind of that's

993
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,839
the outline of the problem and and we're

994
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,160
trying to explain the

995
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,440
the answer and one of the answers for

996
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,118
the the

997
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,560
uh constrained case is that we pretty

998
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
much have to send some

999
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,480
additional pieces and just clarify what

1000
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,760
when you can pin things and when you

1001
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,280
can't ping things

1002
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,000
and there are unfortunately this means

1003
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,200
that there are actually some um

1004
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,240
sane cryptographic uh

1005
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,520
scenarios that you probably shouldn't do

1006
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,439
because it makes your life too

1007
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,800
complicated and so you probably want to

1008
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,079
back off and that's the goal is to

1009
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,680
clarify some of that

1010
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
both in this document but also in the

1011
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,118
registrar operations document

1012
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,520
so that's about it so this um

1013
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,320
this this last consideration for scale

1014
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,160
out um

1015
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,680
that's not specific to the constrained

1016
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,680
voucher case right that

1017
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,680
could equally be of interest for any of

1018
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,279
the other um

1019
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,118
let's let's say the standard brewski

1020
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,760
option right right well

1021
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,599
so if you're using pcx certificates and

1022
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,280
you have a local ca

1023
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,760
um and you're um using the

1024
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,640
uh you're generating end entity

1025
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
certificates

1026
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,078
for the go to previous slide if you

1027
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,240
could actually um

1028
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,000
and you're ending you're generating

1029
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,680
certificates for the pledge interface

1030
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,920
the brewski est

1031
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,759
southward facing thing from your

1032
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,320
certificate authority

1033
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,839
then as long as you pin the certificate

1034
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
authority that's that makes the pledge

1035
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,359
happy and you can do all the scaling in

1036
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,760
all the different ways you like

1037
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,799
it's when you substitute a raw public

1038
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,119
key down there

1039
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
that you realize oh wait the there's no

1040
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,079
relationship

1041
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,119
to a certificate authority there so i

1042
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,760
can't do anything

1043
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,359
uh specific um and there's another

1044
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,839
conversation that we had yesterday

1045
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,799
a little bit in the acme working group

1046
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,680
about um

1047
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,320
what happens if you want like to use a

1048
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,078
um

1049
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,240
web pki uh let's encrypt certificate for

1050
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,359
that pledge interface what happens to

1051
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,799
the pinning process

1052
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,160
and the cms the a bit um that's a

1053
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,599
different conversation that

1054
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,598
requires a longer thread to to discuss

1055
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,920
okay all right i think we're still in

1056
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,040
time thank you very much any

1057
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,040
any more questions on this

1058
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,040
then let's oh there's some slides

1059
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,598
there's some slides after the last slide

1060
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,480
about the um constraint uh join proxy

1061
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,000
if you just give me one more minute okay

1062
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,200
okay

1063
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
that was in the same deck yeah there you

1064
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,240
go

1065
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,839
um no that's not my slide is it

1066
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,319
draft relationships yes it is i'm sorry

1067
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,759
yes there you go um so the constraints

1068
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,079
yeah so there's the constrained joint

1069
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,200
proxy document um

1070
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,640
and um this has been revised a few times

1071
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,078
by the design team next

1072
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,400
slide click um so

1073
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,400
brewski uses http and tls essentially

1074
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,920
builds a circuit proxy

1075
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,000
um there is a way to do this statelessly

1076
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,599
with coap

1077
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,359
which comes with a six dish working

1078
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,040
group

1079
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,920
but there is no way to do this

1080
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,000
statelessly with dtls you can build a

1081
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,280
circuit proxy creating state

1082
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,040
but there's no way to do this in a

1083
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,880
stateless way with dtls and this

1084
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,000
document tries to do that

1085
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,800
um so next slide please

1086
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,240
um so we document the stateful one it's

1087
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,520
essentially a version of

1088
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,560
of nat um circuit proxy um

1089
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
and a stateless one and uh

1090
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,480
there's a little bit of a little bit of

1091
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,839
tweaking of the text to explain it

1092
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,440
but essentially it's waiting for a

1093
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,440
working group adoption that was it

1094
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,160
right um have you seen um

1095
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,839
i'm trying to remember what the working

1096
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,799
group is right so there there's a lot of

1097
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
you know

1098
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,839
also these type of proxy things for

1099
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,319
for for quick happening and quick is

1100
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,520
trying to get also into the datagram

1101
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,359
um service so are we you know going to

1102
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,800
wake up in another year or so and having

1103
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,160
to do everything we're doing

1104
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,160
with dtls with quick

1105
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,880
um well so the brewski

1106
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,640
circuit proxy which is tcp based it's

1107
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,920
not going to work with quick

1108
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,160
um and so if you want to run quick

1109
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,680
on that then the answer is yes we'll

1110
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,960
have to do something

1111
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,598
um i don't know what uh

1112
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,400
and i guess i could go look at those

1113
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:16,480
documents and

1114
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,240
see if there's something there maybe

1115
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,960
part of the answer is don't bother with

1116
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,879
teal

1117
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,480
maybe it's stupid to do dtls if you're

1118
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,599
going to do quick anyway

1119
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,240
um but i don't know i

1120
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,520
i would appreciate some other feedback

1121
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,479
from people as to

1122
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,200
whether to uh deal with all of these

1123
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,319
different

1124
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:40,560
possibilities who really wants what

1125
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:45,599
versus maybe the answer is just

1126
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,359
if you can't use tcp for some reason

1127
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,640
can you really use quick i don't know

1128
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,000
the answer that question i

1129
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,920
would tend to think that if you're in

1130
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,640
that constrained space that you are

1131
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,960
probably more interested in using ad hoc

1132
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,598
um

1133
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,040
and os core than you are in using um

1134
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,000
quick

1135
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,680
yeah well i mean yeah i think that's

1136
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,960
just just always keep it in the back of

1137
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,279
your mind right that

1138
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,319
there's a lot of you know effort wasted

1139
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,000
sorry not wasted

1140
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,680
it invested into the dtls solution so

1141
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
let's make sure that we're

1142
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,040
kind of continuing to yeah on the

1143
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,640
registrar to master side of things

1144
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,279
if you can get quick through the

1145
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,960
enterprise then you can use it as you

1146
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,640
like it's just http

1147
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,000
whatever three or whatever we're calling

1148
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,560
it right

1149
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,560
we don't care

1150
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,400
okay

1151
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,599
so i think stefan wanted to uh take

1152
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,119
these slides

1153
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,880
yes ah okay

1154
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,520
so i would like to give an update on the

1155
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,800
brisket ae asynchronous enrollment draft

1156
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,640
we haven't submitted an updated draft

1157
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,000
because we are still working on on one

1158
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,240
of the use cases

1159
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,760
to get more more meat into the use case

1160
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,598
and get a better description

1161
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,760
of the single items that we will talk

1162
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,079
about uh in a minute

1163
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,079
click

1164
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,359
so just to recall what is the problem

1165
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,400
statement for a risky ae

1166
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,960
uh we we have use cases where we see

1167
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
that there is

1168
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,160
that there is no connection to a backend

1169
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,119
infrastructure so

1170
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,359
there is a mechanism needed that we need

1171
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,640
to bind the certificate signing request

1172
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,759
directly to the identity of the pledge

1173
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,000
we use that by we address that and use

1174
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,880
case one by basically using

1175
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,720
signed wrapped objects which are used

1176
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,720
for the certification requests in the

1177
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,439
same way as the voucher request

1178
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,879
that poses some requirements to the

1179
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,720
enrollment protocol

1180
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,079
and in use case one we are mainly

1181
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,959
focusing or we are mainly

1182
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,160
pointing uh to enrollment protocols that

1183
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,079
support those

1184
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,319
signature wrapped objects for

1185
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,599
certificate for certification requests

1186
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,640
which would be

1187
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,599
as stated in the draft est with full cmc

1188
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,560
or also the lightweight cmp version

1189
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,200
click

1190
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,319
so that there was no change uh to the

1191
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,200
description yet

1192
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,279
for use case one use case two uh

1193
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,118
introduces a push model so we call it

1194
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,079
push model because uh in the original

1195
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,520
brewski

1196
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,319
draft we consider that as pool model

1197
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,280
because the pledge

1198
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,240
pulls essentially all necessary

1199
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,000
information

1200
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,919
like the voucher and the certificate

1201
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,079
from the infrastructure near the domain

1202
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,640
registrar in use case two

1203
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,599
and the push model we reverse that role

1204
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,598
because in

1205
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,800
industry industrial environments

1206
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,359
typically the

1207
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,599
the pledge site would be the server side

1208
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,640
so that means

1209
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,720
we need to to provide that reverse role

1210
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,520
description so the draft

1211
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,399
again uses signature wrapped objects to

1212
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,160
basically have

1213
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,880
a secure exchange between the

1214
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,480
pledge and the domain registrar so if

1215
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,319
you jump to the next slide

1216
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,680
then you can see the architecture for

1217
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,800
that so on the

1218
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,839
on the right hand side uh you see that

1219
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,200
between the pledge call ye and

1220
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,520
uh the the domain registrar there is a

1221
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,480
new component called pledge agent that

1222
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,640
basically

1223
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,319
works as a proxy between the pledge and

1224
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,680
the joint proxy

1225
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,520
and so the

1226
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,359
use case too is currently what we are

1227
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,560
focusing on also in the discussion of

1228
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,560
the

1229
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:38,000
in the design team which uh

1230
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,160
michael mentioned so um

1231
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,280
the the protocol approach at first we

1232
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,040
thought to be

1233
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,640
very close to briskey so we at the time

1234
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,160
of discussion now we are

1235
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,078
at the stage where we say between the

1236
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:52,799
pledge agent and the pledge

1237
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,839
called ye we use a similar approach as

1238
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,359
in brewski

1239
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,520
that means http and tls

1240
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,119
between those components what we are

1241
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,560
currently discussing is the trust

1242
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,319
relationship

1243
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,160
between the pledge agent and the pledge

1244
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,880
and also between the pledge agent

1245
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,440
and the domain registrar so we had some

1246
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,040
discussion of how to use tls between the

1247
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,160
pledge agent and the pledge because

1248
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,279
there is no

1249
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,319
no prior trust relation

1250
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:24,319
for them so we thought about

1251
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:27,839
using a psk based cipher suite

1252
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,920
in tls which can be used to at least

1253
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,680
vouch for proximity between the pledge

1254
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,040
agent and the pledge

1255
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:37,040
so the the intention is to have as less

1256
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,240
trust assumptions on the pledge agent

1257
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,440
for that because

1258
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,439
he actually

1259
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,200
works as as a as a proxy between the

1260
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,440
pledge and

1261
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:51,919
the registrar so the security as such

1262
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,280
depends mostly on the on the signature

1263
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,760
wrapping that is happening between the

1264
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,839
objects

1265
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,440
exchanged between the pledge and the

1266
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,400
domain registrar

1267
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,440
so that is currently in discussion so a

1268
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,160
further point is

1269
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
the endpoint definition for the pledge

1270
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,040
itself

1271
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,960
because the pledge assert acts as a

1272
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,160
server so

1273
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,160
we we need to have uh endpoints defined

1274
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,078
on the on the pledge side to be able to

1275
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,359
contact the pledge and to request

1276
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,559
certain actions

1277
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,720
so for that we also relied on the

1278
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,480
the currently defined approach in

1279
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,759
brewski

1280
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,760
uh yeah period

1281
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,280
next discussion is related to the object

1282
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,880
format for the exchange

1283
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,839
of the signature wrapped objects and

1284
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,839
that goes back to the

1285
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,680
to the discussion that michael was was

1286
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,400
just had with the previous graph so

1287
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,759
currently

1288
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,880
we think about something like uh

1289
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,160
jwt signed json

1290
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,720
as object exchange between the pledge

1291
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,799
agent

1292
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,799
the pledge and the domain registrar

1293
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:06,000
okay so because i just read it

1294
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,640
uh the the comment from esco so the the

1295
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,680
intention

1296
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,759
also to use a psk based

1297
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,200
mode between the fletch agent and the

1298
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,480
pledge itself

1299
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,359
um was also to not rely on the

1300
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,400
or to not bind the exchanges to tls

1301
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,640
because if there is

1302
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
some other means some other transport

1303
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,319
means between the pledge agent and the

1304
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,079
pledge

1305
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,640
that doesn't feature a tls or http like

1306
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:33,359
nfc

1307
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,920
or bluetooth then we may not be able to

1308
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,960
rely on the transport security as

1309
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,880
defined than if it is bound to tls so

1310
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:46,079
that was a reason to just take

1311
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,559
a psk for vouching for proximity

1312
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,000
so i have some some more detailed slides

1313
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:53,359
on the backup so you

1314
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,359
probably need to click twice

1315
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,919
right um so uh that was the discussion

1316
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,200
that we have on the

1317
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,720
the design team um so

1318
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,640
more or less repeating some of the

1319
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,279
things are already set so the potential

1320
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,118
use of a qr code or something similar

1321
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,480
uh to vouch for the proximity between

1322
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,920
the pledge and the pledge agent is

1323
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,240
currently being discussed

1324
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,440
that relates to the tls and tls cipher

1325
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,160
suites to be used

1326
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
we discussed also to use something like

1327
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,480
the

1328
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,720
the subserts that is currently in

1329
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,920
discussion in the tls working group

1330
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,160
but uh it's yeah because of the

1331
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,160
possibility to use bluetooth or nfc or

1332
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,359
other protocols between the pledge agent

1333
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,279
and the pledge

1334
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,440
we decided that this is not a good fit

1335
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,640
because that has a high dependency on

1336
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,720
tls obviously and

1337
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,879
regarding the trust relation between the

1338
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,480
pledge agent itself and the registrar

1339
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
the the draft currently mentioned that

1340
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,839
there are two two options

1341
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,440
so the pledge agent may feature an ldf

1342
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,599
that can be used for client-side

1343
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,760
authentication and tls

1344
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,960
then if this is the case we we have to

1345
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,359
address that

1346
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,839
the pledge agent authenticates towards

1347
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,400
the registrar instead of the

1348
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,920
instead of the pledge authentication

1349
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,520
within tls

1350
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,599
because the pledge agent then would

1351
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,520
utilize that communication to

1352
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,040
forward the voucher request and also the

1353
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,319
certificate signing request or the

1354
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,079
enrollment request

1355
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:24,400
over the to the domain registrant

1356
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,400
um

1357
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,520
right so um

1358
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,640
let's see what's on the slide down there

1359
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,480
um so we have some some open discussion

1360
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,720
regarding the

1361
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,559
the potential attacks so regarding the

1362
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,759
security considerations

1363
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:46,319
and uh from the discussion we had uh

1364
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,359
during the last design team meeting we

1365
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,480
figured out that

1366
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,640
from a security perspective there is a

1367
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,160
denial of service attack possibility on

1368
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,160
the pledge

1369
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,598
if the pledge has open endpoints and can

1370
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,879
be triggered

1371
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:04,160
but except that those we

1372
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:09,520
we haven't seen different attack vectors

1373
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:11,200
than uh then addressed by brewski itself

1374
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,319
so that is the state for that if you

1375
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,319
jump to the next slide

1376
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,640
yeah those i mentioned that we we

1377
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,319
currently discuss about uh different end

1378
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,319
points on the pledge side

1379
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:25,599
so we currently define four different

1380
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,079
endpoints

1381
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,680
um one is to trigger a voucher request

1382
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,800
so that would mean that the pledge

1383
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,279
agent triggers the pledge to create the

1384
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,280
voucher request

1385
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,800
then the same would be done with the

1386
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,880
enrollment request

1387
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,960
resulting in a certificate signing

1388
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,000
request pkcs10

1389
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:49,280
which is which

1390
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,839
is being forwarded then to the registrar

1391
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,079
uh as soon as the pledge agent talked to

1392
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,759
the registrar and the register did the

1393
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,119
backend communication with the mother

1394
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,520
and the domain ca

1395
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,599
and you expect the information about the

1396
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,400
voucher responses and role response he

1397
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,079
gets back to the

1398
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,839
to the pledge and provides those

1399
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,359
information to the

1400
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,880
appropriate endpoint so that would be

1401
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,119
the voucher response

1402
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,599
that provides the voucher status as

1403
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,000
answer and the enrollment response would

1404
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,000
return

1405
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,079
the enrollment status that can be then

1406
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,079
further processed by the domain register

1407
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,960
so i said we have some some

1408
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,000
clarifications regarding the encodings

1409
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,559
uh of of the different uh

1410
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,839
objects that are going back and forth so

1411
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:38,240
if we use cms sign json or jw assigned

1412
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:40,480
json but that is open currently

1413
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:42,558
okay so then on the next slide there is

1414
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,680
just a small summary of

1415
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,480
changes in the draft um i

1416
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,759
won't go into detail to that because of

1417
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,640
the matter of time

1418
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,720
um there are just some updates to

1419
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,000
different sections in the document to

1420
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,720
better

1421
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,440
explain and motivate the use case too

1422
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,558
with uh

1423
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,839
with a push model and

1424
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,680
the next slide uh

1425
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:09,440
shows some discussion and open issues

1426
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,480
from from the last meeting that we

1427
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,240
discussed there

1428
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,400
so discovery of the enrollment options

1429
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,879
on the registrar uh that was addressed

1430
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,000
by

1431
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,599
michael thanks for that in the brewski

1432
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:25,359
main document so the change from

1433
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,400
from est to to brewski which allows to

1434
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,200
use all the other

1435
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,880
enrollment protocols on the on the

1436
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,078
registrar side

1437
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,040
then we have still the ongoing

1438
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,359
discussion about

1439
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,200
the trust relations and the use cases

1440
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,240
use case 2

1441
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,240
in the design team

1442
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,160
we had some discussion about the

1443
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,960
necessity of providing the proximity

1444
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,440
register

1445
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,520
certificate for the pledge to include

1446
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,119
that in the voucher request

1447
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,759
i think that discussion uh is

1448
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,440
finished because from my understanding

1449
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,680
we see that there is a necessity that

1450
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,079
the pledge agent basically provides a

1451
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,359
proximity register certificate to the

1452
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,920
pledge agent

1453
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:08,880
to be included in the voucher request

1454
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,359
that enables

1455
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,960
the the registrar at the end because he

1456
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,920
doesn't have a direct relationship to

1457
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,359
the

1458
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,640
um to the pledge that the registrar

1459
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:22,400
can verify that he's indeed the register

1460
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,240
or the target register

1461
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,119
uh for that voucher request processing

1462
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,640
um there are different transport options

1463
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,599
uh that is something which which is

1464
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,799
still open

1465
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:39,680
the current draft is asset assumes

1466
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:42,240
to use http and also to use tls

1467
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,240
next slide

1468
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,319
so next step would be the further

1469
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,760
refinement of the push approach

1470
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:51,920
that relates to the use case too uh

1471
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,440
also according to the discussions that

1472
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,480
we had in the design team

1473
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,079
addressing certain open issues and then

1474
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,599
the outcome will be circulated on the

1475
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,160
mailing list for further discussion and

1476
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:03,440
would be used to update the draft to be

1477
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,720
ready for the

1478
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:08,880
yeah i i would submit that then

1479
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,279
probably in december or beginning of

1480
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,280
january

1481
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:16,640
excellent thank you very much any

1482
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:19,520
questions on that

1483
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,520
on the microphone

1484
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,880
okay nobody

1485
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:35,359
sorry nope okay

1486
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:37,760
let's uh go on file some

1487
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,759
second

1488
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,960
uh sorry uh what i'm

1489
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,558
i think i'm confused here what was the

1490
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,920
uh

1491
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,920
i have the last slide deck

1492
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:01,359
the uh ecloud right the cloud thing so

1493
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:05,839
where is the cloud deck uh

1494
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:07,839
you don't think oh yeah yeah this uh

1495
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,960
right there was no cloud in the name

1496
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,839
that got me

1497
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,839
confused i'm sorry yeah

1498
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:19,839
go ahead so owen freely fought and i

1499
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,920
have

1500
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:24,078
spent a bunch of time in august and

1501
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:27,839
september on this document

1502
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,839
uh next slide please

1503
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,799
um this is the change in the table of

1504
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,520
contents you can see it's much expanded

1505
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,799
um and i would say pretty much complete

1506
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,759
at this point

1507
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:42,240
feature complete probably has bugs next

1508
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,240
slide click

1509
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,440
so we work that's reworked the

1510
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,440
terminology which is on the next

1511
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,799
slide we clarify the two use cases

1512
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,559
and eliminated one use case

1513
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:59,119
and whatever the third point was i

1514
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,640
missed um this is the terminology about

1515
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,319
what we're dealing with so

1516
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,000
the local domain is the place where

1517
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,160
you're physically from

1518
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,240
um and it may be different than the

1519
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,920
pledge owner's domain so you may in fact

1520
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,319
be bringing up a

1521
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,960
device or a pledge typically in this

1522
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:16,240
case we

1523
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,359
the example we talk about is a sip phone

1524
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,040
um in a place other than where it is so

1525
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:23,119
the example is you send a zip

1526
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,119
phone home or in fact maybe shipped it

1527
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,720
to an employee at their home

1528
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:29,119
because they're working at home the

1529
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,720
owner domain is is where the the pledge

1530
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,079
needs to connect to

1531
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,640
and um the cloud registrar is

1532
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,760
a default url that is well known to the

1533
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,640
pledge be do

1534
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:42,000
it being built in during manufacturing

1535
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,440
um

1536
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,559
there's a registrar that the owner has

1537
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,640
and in some cases

1538
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,880
we're saying that the registrar is an

1539
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,078
est only registrar not a brewski

1540
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,280
registrar

1541
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,119
next slide so

1542
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,640
the two major cases are basically

1543
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,359
distinguished as to where there's a

1544
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,558
redirect

1545
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:06,078
and how what form the redirect is in the

1546
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,400
owner registrar discovery

1547
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,359
what happens is that the pledge which

1548
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,880
has finds no

1549
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,680
grasp uh announcements in in its lonely

1550
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,520
home

1551
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,960
reaches out to essentially cloud ra

1552
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:23,759
and it sends a router request to it um

1553
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,599
and the cloud ra having knowledge of

1554
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,640
where this device is supposed to be

1555
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,880
um deployed based upon the contents of

1556
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:34,160
the voucher request and the idef id that

1557
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:37,359
authenticated it sends back a 307

1558
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,558
location update and basically redirects

1559
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:43,839
the pledge to try again um

1560
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,839
with the owner registrar so in this case

1561
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,040
the scenario is the phone has been taken

1562
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,319
home

1563
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:52,880
you plug it in to the wire because

1564
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,160
we can't do onboarding on wi-fi without

1565
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,920
some local help

1566
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,680
so we assume we plug it in and

1567
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,520
then it discovers oh you're supposed to

1568
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,720
be connected to this

1569
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,359
hosted pbx system um and it reaches out

1570
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,558
to that

1571
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:09,598
system um using uh the same provisional

1572
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:13,920
tls

1573
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:17,359
um and does its onboarding continues on

1574
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,200
so next slide please and the other

1575
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:21,759
situation is one

1576
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,118
where the enterprise is perhaps a little

1577
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,400
bit more advanced or

1578
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,400
in some cases maybe they are a little

1579
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,920
bit more behind

1580
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,000
having implemented something maybe a

1581
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,520
decade ago and they've they have a regis

1582
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,920
they have a an est uh uh system

1583
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,640
it doesn't speak brewski however is the

1584
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,799
problem

1585
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,759
um but it could on board a device if

1586
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,559
only uh

1587
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,559
the device knew to talk to it um and so

1588
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,280
that in this case what happens is that

1589
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:48,960
the cloud

1590
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,240
ra answers the voucher request with a

1591
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,359
voucher

1592
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,640
but it doesn't pin the itself

1593
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:59,839
to the to the device rather it pins

1594
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:02,640
the this uh est server

1595
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,558
um and tells it where the pledge where

1596
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,879
to find the est server

1597
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,880
um and then there's also in the text

1598
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,000
some explanation of where it might find

1599
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,599
its configuration

1600
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,640
data um but the important part is the

1601
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,280
redirect

1602
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,078
um is contained within the voucher and

1603
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,520
it happens after the voucher is issued

1604
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,599
and i think that's the last slide but

1605
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,480
next slide yeah

1606
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,480
questions dot

1607
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,760
okay

1608
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:38,799
i think we're right on the dot yep

1609
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,119
on 90 seconds over so yeah please uh you

1610
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,520
know

1611
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,720
repeat the question on the mailing list

1612
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:45,520
um and then

1613
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,520
we'll go from there

1614
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,118
and yep that's the end of the time

1615
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,839
that's the end of the agenda

1616

all virtual

1618
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,399
in wherever the next cyberspace is that

1619
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:07,359
we're

1620
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:11,280
