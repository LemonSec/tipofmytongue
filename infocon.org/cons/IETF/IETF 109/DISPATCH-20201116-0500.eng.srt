okay

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,400
all right we're at the top of the hour

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,840
so let's start with a few of the

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,959
preliminaries while we see

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,560
um who drifts in welcome um

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
ietf 109 i guess is uh underway here

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
with the first of the working group

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,079
sessions for the week

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
my name is patrick mcmanus um got my

10
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,040
co-chairs here uh ben

11

an incoming co-chair of chris dp we'll

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,760
talk about that in a

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,718
in a moment as we go um here's our

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,879
agenda

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,360
for today we can have just a look over

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,839
it but um

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,680
from the top uh we of course need

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,879
um we need a note taker for this session

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,600
braum i believe uh offered to do that on

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,399
the mailing list i'm not sure if i see

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,600
you braun in the participant list or not

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,280
let's see feel free to grab the

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
microphone and shout out if you're there

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
i'm gonna need a note taker before we

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
get going

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
so if braun isn't there yet would um

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,240
anyone else be willing to pitch

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,240
in

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,520
i know the timing is tough the system is

31
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
new

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,798
and we have a hot agenda to get to but

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
we do need someone to take minutes

34
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,920
before we can proceed

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,960
all right we'll go with this one can you

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,320
hear me i do feel a little like i'm

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
talking into a void today

38
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
we can hear you patrick i think what

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
we've got is the moment where everyone's

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
trying to be quiet and not be noticed

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
while you're asking for no tickets

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,000
i know it's easier to avoid eye contact

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,640
in this virtual format than it is uh

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,840
than it is in the room we need we need

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,839
the feature to turn on people's video

46
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
remotely

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
so hopefully braun will join shortly but

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,599
we could certainly use a second

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,200
notetaker one way or the other

50
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,440
so so please someone anyone well

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,040
kirsty said in the jabber room that she

52
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,400
can take notes

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
okay okay i just just paged away from

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
the jabber room

55
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,238
i missed that that'll work out great and

56
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,959
ben you're going to keep an eye on

57
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,440
jabber right

58
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
it sounds like uh well apparently i'm

59
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,440
supposed to be but

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
here we go all right looking at jabber

61
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,359
now

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
all right uh with those preliminaries

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,720
out of the way

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
you can see what we our agenda in front

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
of us we're going to have a short

66
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
discussion

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,839
um from our id's we have two dispatch

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,399
items to talk about

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,640
uh as a reminder the purpose of dispatch

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
is really to be a friendly and welcoming

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
place to

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,280
new work to the ietf and

73
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,359
to help it find the permanent homework

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,879
will really be developed

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
this working group itself very rarely

76
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,798
adopts a draft

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
the more likely and desirable outcomes

78
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
are to find an existing working group

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
for draft

80
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,080
to discuss whether or not perhaps a mini

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
working group would be in order

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
perhaps a buff would be in order and to

83
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,958
make you know a recommendation amongst

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,319
those things or even perhaps a

85
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
recommendation not to proceed at all

86
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,280
with the work

87
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,760
to the ads who of course get to make the

88
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,920
the actual decisions so we have a couple

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,399
things to talk about under dispatch

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,200
the haptics top-level media type and the

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,040
webrtc http ingestion protocol

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
this is a joint meeting with the art

93
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,079
area um

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,680
which means we'll also highlight some

95
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,599
other stuff going on in the art area of

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
the ietf this week

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,079
and have an fyi discussion of work that

98
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,320
may be even like too early for

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
being dispatched but is of interest and

100
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
could take

101
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,960
feedback from from this audience as well

102
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,120
that alexi will be presenting

103
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,758
on media types or rather content types

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
to distinguish between forward and

105
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,400
encapsulated

106
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,520
uh encrypted each uh encrypted

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,679
emails i believe okay

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,159
a reminder of our mailing list art at

109
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,720
iatf.org and dispatch at itf 4

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
being the mailing list and we don't have

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
our note well

112
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,719
in these slides i'm sorry that's my

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
oversight

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,080
but i will refer everyone especially

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,159
given that this is the

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,400
first meeting of the week to uh in your

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
favorite search engine look up iatf note

118
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,520
well

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
those are important terms under which

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,400
your contributions with the iatf are

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
governed

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,960
a contribution is almost anything you do

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,440
that interacts with

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,039
with other folks in a semi-public ietf

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,840
context so that could be a mailing list

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,639
that could be this

127
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,560
meeting and so those cover things rules

128
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,320
both related to ipr as well as your

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,000
your code of conduct during these

130
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,719
meetings so if you're not familiar with

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,919
that

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,639
please do take a look all right that's

133
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
the usual

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
getting started stuff out of the way um

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,600
and with that we can

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
uh move over to our first speaker which

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,120
i think is going to be

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039

of happier news we have a new chair

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,440
as many of you also know we we've been

168
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,799
interested in rotating chairs in this

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,319
particular working group to

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,960
give different people a shot at

171

having having something to do with

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,400
bringing new work into the art area and

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,440
being more exposed to

174
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,039
things in the art area so

175
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,759
ben is rotating out and kirsty payne

176

from the

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
uk national cyber security center is

178
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,240
rotating in

179
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,440
and she will be our new chair starting

180
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
at this meeting

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680

the button

183
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
to update the data tracker for care

184
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,599
state and

185
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,560

um to our first dispatch item of the day

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,959
which is the haptics presentation um

218
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,880
do we have our speaker available

219
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,399

restaurant hello so um i'm going to show

221
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,760
your slides because it just disaster

222
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
always happens if um

223
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
okay if we don't have the shirts do that

224
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
but when you want a new slide just shout

225
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
out um

226
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,839
next slide okay okay

227
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
given that this is my first ever ietf

228
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,279
meeting what's a

229
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,040
protocol do i need to have my video on

230
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,800
while i'm while i'm talking

231
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,199
i mean i'm happy to go either way i just

232
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,199
want to know

233
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,519
that's up to you but um i think the

234
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,760
trend is towards more video and i

235
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,000
personally think it's nice

236
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,319
um would you like questions um during

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,600
your questions at the end

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,519
uh questions during is fine uh

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
if i'm not able to answer the question i

240
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,079
will ask until i

241
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,920

hi everyone good morning good evening

256
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
good afternoon if you are in a time zone

257
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,760
where it is afternoon

258
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
uh my name is yeshwanth muthusami i work

259
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,560
for immersion

260
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,160
and i'm going to be presenting our uh id

261
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
on the on on a proposal for haptics as a

262
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,519
top-level media type

263
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,519
uh next slide please patrick

264
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,560
okay just a quick quick introduction

265
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,599
haptics refers to the degeneration of

266
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,599
touch related sensation it's the

267
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,880
it's a slight vibration that you feel

268
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,959
when you're trying to

269
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
set the date and time on your iphone or

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,279
other smartphone

271
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
uh it's used widely in in a number of

272
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
consumer

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,440
devices for where your work

274
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
when you're using your virtual keyboard

275
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
or to get any kind of

276
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,399
vibrating notifications and off late in

277
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,320
in many of the cars the the dashboard

278
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,440
the buttons are usually replaced by a

279
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,839
large

280
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,880
touchscreen that provides a

281
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
bi-directional

282
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
touch interface and the thing about

283
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,720
haptics is there

284
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
it requires some kind of actuation to in

285
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
order to

286
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,880
to create that tactile sensation in a

287
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,319
mobile device that actuation is provided

288
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,480
by small vibrating motors or actuators

289
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
or in a larger or automotive touch

290
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,279
screen these actuators are

291
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,440
piezoelectric materials and haptics are

292
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,639
these days they seem to be everywhere

293
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,600
the the most recent example is a sony

294
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,800
ps5 dual sensor controller which has

295
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
just been released

296
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,000
and it's getting a lot of good press

297
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,959
because of its

298
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,440
haptics controller or pretty much all of

299
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,680
their

300
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,680
smartphones on the market have haptics

301
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,199
in them and they are right haptics is

302
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,839
considered pretty essential

303
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,560
for enhanced media experiences next

304
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:27,839
slide please okay

305
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,319
the this is uh just an uh

306
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,040
indication of that of the differences

307
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
between

308
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,719
version zero zero which has been uh on

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,639
the

310
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,959
dispatch mailing list since the middle

311
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,920
of october and version one

312
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,119
which i uploaded a few hours ago i i

313
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,479
apologize for this

314
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,920
late breaking uh uh update but until

315
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,399
late yesterday evening i didn't know i

316
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,719
was going to be presenting here so

317
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,560
uh thanks to an ee and email snafu

318
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,760
at our end i wasn't aware of this

319
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,399
presentation

320
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,439
so i kind of had to scramble and get the

321
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,920
new version out

322
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
the new version it tries to address all

323
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
of the comments

324
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,000
which we have received on version zero

325
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,040
zero on the on the dispatch mailing list

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,160
and specifically it try

327
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,199
it tries to i've added pros to

328
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,600
dispel the inadvertent inadvertent

329
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,560
misconception that some people has he

330
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
seemed to have

331
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,079
gotten from version zero zero that these

332
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
these following haptic subtypes were

333
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,319
already in use

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,040
that is not the case the haptic data

335
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,000
formats like ahap and org and ibs and

336
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,120
hapt are

337
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,560
are indeed widely in use and we expect

338
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,519
them to live under the

339
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,239
haptics top level type once it's

340
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,120
approved

341
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,040
so i made that point more clearer and

342
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
based on feedback from more than one

343
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,639
person i've added

344
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,920
the sections on the subtype

345
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,360
registrations for

346
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,920
haptic slash ibs and haptic slash hacked

347
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
to to just to illustrate how the subtype

348
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,800
registrations

349
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,040
would be handled once we have a haptics

350
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
approved at the top level i've added a

351
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
number of new

352
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
new references that show the progression

353
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,240
of the standardization

354
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,439
of haptics in mpeg and the availability

355
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
of documents for the various haptic data

356
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
formats

357
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,880
that we envision to live under the

358
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,560
haptics top level type

359
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,760
so that is the basic basic differences

360
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,760
so if people have read version zero zero

361
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,519
i i just want to point out that my

362
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,639
presentation is going to be based on

363
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,320
version one and this slide uh it kind of

364
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,120
gives you an indication of what is

365
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
different

366
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,079
which you may not have gone through next

367
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,079
slide please

368
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,040
okay in the in the next series of eight

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
slides

370
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,959
i basically go through various

371
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
justifications for why we believe

372
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,000
haptics needs to be treated as a top

373
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,319
level type and

374
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,040
that's what i'm uh that's what you're

375
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,600
going to be

376
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,360
seeing uh the first slide here is

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,720
basically more of an introduction

378
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
so to speak uh haptic signals provide

379
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
an additional layer of entertainment and

380
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,199
overall sensory immersion

381
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,880
and the and as the user experience and

382
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,240
enjoyment of media content

383
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,519
can be significantly enhanced if you add

384
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,959
haptics to the audio

385
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:30,399
video content in iso bmf files

386
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,719
media streams like atsc 3.0 broadcast

387
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,680
for those who may not be aware atsc to

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
3.0

389
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
is the next generation of the tv

390
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,758
standard

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
it's an international standard but

392
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,880
mainly used in the us and

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,199
south korea and also in streaming games

394
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,160
and

395
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,920
mobile advertising and i mentioned the

396
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,719
last part mobile advertising

397
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,519
because it it provides a good segue into

398
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,000
the last

399
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,040
point on the slide which is haptic

400
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
tracks

401
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,199
in separate files are already being

402
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,759
combined with audio video files

403
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,959
and played back in sync to provide an

404
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,920
overall immersive

405
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,399
media experience so it's not just audio

406
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,959
vivi

407
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,079
visual but now you have audio visual and

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,560
tactile

409
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,719
and our and the mobile advertising

410
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,758
business that my company used to have

411
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,839
actually used this exact mechanism

412
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,839
uh next slide please

413
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
and to date there hasn't been a

414
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,000
registration of for

415
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,638
formats for haptics and but uh

416
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,440
but starting in april haptics will have

417
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,680
was

418
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,360
proposed as a first order media type

419
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,880
which means that it's at the same level

420
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
as audio and video tracks

421
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,880
in the iso based media file format and

422
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,920
this proposal that we made was accepted

423
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,800
by the mpeg

424
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,439
systems file format group and then it

425
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,199
has since

426
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,560
progressed to dan which is a draft

427
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,560
amendment in

428
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,319
the at the uh october meeting which

429
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,079
ended in october 16th

430
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,199
after passing a worldwide

431
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,039
cd ballot so it is moving on to the next

432
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,480
stage in the standardization

433
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,799
and if it if it progresses at its pace

434
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,599
it's

435
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
expected to issue as an amendment uh

436
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,159
which would be which would be the

437
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,000
equivalent of an

438
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,000
international standard in october 2021

439
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,119
and when when that happens it will

440
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,319
become part of the

441
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,678
iso iec 14496

442
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,559
part 12 sixth edition and

443
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,919
this is a question we get asked often

444
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,840
how is it

445
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,200
what is going to be the designation for

446
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,799
haptics in

447
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,000
mp4 files given that video mp4

448
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,799
is already taken and audio mp4 is

449
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,480
already taken

450
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,520
and and and we do realize that and so if

451
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,280
a video a an mp4 file has got video

452
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,600
audio and haptics then

453
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
we are not going to mess with the

454
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,639
designation

455
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,000
it it's going to it's going to still be

456
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,840
video

457
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,080
mp4 the same goes for if a file has

458
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,959
audio and haptics and happens to be a

459
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,159
dot mp4

460
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,280
file we are not going to change the

461
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,559
designation uh but

462
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,520
we are we do envision to

463
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,000
mp4 files with just haptic tracks in

464
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,960
them

465
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
and the examples of such files would be

466
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
uh

467
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,080
mp4 files used for streaming games or

468
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,520
have haptic files for haptic

469
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,240
vests and and bodysuits and belts and

470
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,280
gloves

471
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,400
and for those files we envisioned that

472
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,600
designation haptic slash and b4

473
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,640
uh next slide please

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,678
okay now there are i mean for the

475
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,039
longest time

476
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,799
haptics was kind of of

477
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:58,080
to a lot of people haptics meant

478
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,600
either the buzzing or the rumble in the

479
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
older game controllers or

480
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
just the vibrating feedback that you had

481
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,199
on the older phones

482
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,840
uh but haptics has actually got multiple

483
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,000
sub modalities vibro tactile which is a

484
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,159
touch vibration is just one of them

485
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
the force feedback we which you will

486
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,039
feel in the

487
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,760
in the sony ps5 dual sensor controller

488
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,160
is called kinesthetic haptics and the

489
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,160
surface

490
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,240
is for the friction and and where you

491
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
can actually

492
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
get the different types of you can get

493
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,160
the feel

494
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,120
of different textures so you you can

495
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
actually get the

496
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,280
feeling that the the that you're feeling

497
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,919
uh that that you're actually touching

498
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,280
rock

499
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,000
or soft silk or a sharp object

500
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,200
or all that be because of the surface

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,679
friction that

502
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
you feel on your fingertips and then you

503
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,760
have the spatial

504
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,720
non-contact haptics which is based on

505
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
ultrasound and last but not least you

506
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,120
have the

507
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,440
thermal haptics so these are all the

508
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
different submodalities of haptics that

509
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,480
you need to take into account

510
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,959
and and designating haptics as a

511
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,840
top level media type would allow us the

512
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
definition

513
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,120
would enable the definition of these

514
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,158
data formats pertaining to these sub

515
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,039
modalities

516
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
in a more streamlined manner and you

517
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,559
will not be able to

518
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,760
do this with this level of the required

519
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,559
granularity

520
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
if you were to place haptics willy-nilly

521
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,520
under

522
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,559
any of the existing top level types like

523
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,720
audio video

524
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:38,240
or application next slide please

525
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,720
and this in my opinion is a pretty

526
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,760
compelling reason uh your mileage might

527
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,480
vary i mean

528
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
for for the human sense of hearing we

529
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,880
have the top level

530
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,640
media type of audio for the human sense

531
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
of seeing we have the

532
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,720
top level type top-level media type

533
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,240
video and for the equally important

534
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,159
human sense of touch

535
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,240
i think it makes for perfect sense to

536
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,240
have the top level

537
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,960
media type haptics and more to the point

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,000
placing haptics under audio or video is

539
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
not reflective

540
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,280
of the kinds of files or the use cases

541
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,760
that would need

542
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,440
haptics but would really have nothing to

543
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:22,240
do whatsoever with audio or video

544
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
next slide please

545
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,039
okay and there is a considerable amount

546
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
of

547
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,120
commercial uptake as i kind of mentioned

548
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,158
in passing

549
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:37,439
earlier it is rapidly becoming a

550
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,320
standard feature of many ce devices and

551
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
these

552
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,879
bullet points basically give you an idea

553
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
of the extent of the uptake

554
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,000
i iphone as you can as you see here is

555
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,320
over

556
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,039
191 million this is data from last year

557
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,520
the

558
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,559
the last year for which full year data

559
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,559
is available

560
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,760
and it does have native success support

561
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,678
for haptic encoded

562
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,360
data uh the the aaa app format as well

563
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,440
as the core haptics api

564
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,120
for those of you who are familiar with

565
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,559
the ios platform

566
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,320
in android you have a api css support of

567
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,240
haptic pub

568
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,280
buffers the w3c has got an html

569
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,880
vibration api which is

570
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,639
which provides haptic support in the

571
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,520
mobile web browsers

572
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
i've already mentioned the game consoles

573
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,200
and those

574
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,080
remain a very popular ce device or

575
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
close to 40 million units sold and then

576
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,280
xr

577
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
is in high here is an upcoming market

578
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,799
and

579
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,080
it helped in large part by the first

580
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,360
version of the kronos

581
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,678
open xr haptic api and so

582
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,840
haptic media is expected to be commonly

583
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,280
exchanged between these devices

584
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,639
and since these devices in in total they

585
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,080
represent the majority

586
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,919
of ce devices around the world

587
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,960
i think a strong case can be made for

588
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,760
haptics to be a top-level media type

589
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
next slide please

590
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,159
and haptic data formats

591
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,760
are already in use these are prevalent

592
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,480
in a large number of

593
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,200
devices around the world and these would

594
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,559
live

595
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
as subtypes under the proposed haptic

596
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
top level

597
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,439
media type once it's once it's

598
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,200
standardized or once it's

599
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,360
registered uh the aaa app for for format

600
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,120
which is the apple haptic and audio

601
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,158
pattern data format

602
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,280
which is this is the de facto standard

603
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,320
encoding on all ios devices and ios

604
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,480
connected game peripherals

605
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,360
and of late it has seen usage and

606
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,559
adoption

607
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,840
beyond apple devices as well uh

608
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,480
the very recently in android 11

609
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,639
google has introduced a proprietary

610
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,000
extension to the og for

611
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,200
format specifically to any enable

612
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,559
uh the adhd in the encoding of half

613
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,559
of haptic media in org files the

614
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,158
ibs haptic data format is a

615
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,639
vendor-specific format

616
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,919
as of now that is in use in mobile

617
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,400
phones from lg

618
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,840
electronics a number of models like the

619
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
v30 v40

620
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,678
and the newest v50 that are sold

621
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,440
worldwide

622
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,720
and gaming phones from asus

623
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:32,159
especially the rog one and the

624
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,880
rog ii and rog3 which are also available

625
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
worldwide the hacked haptic data format

626
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,360
is another

627
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,480
vendor-specific format which is used in

628
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,120
mobile haptic advertising as well as the

629
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,080
the following two game developers in

630
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,399
japan

631
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
you use them as part of immersions touch

632
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,760
sense

633
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
sdk next slide please

634
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,039
now these are these subtypes don't yet

635
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,440
uh haven't yet been standardized but the

636
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,760
but

637
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,120
they live in terms of and they live in

638
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,480
an informative annex

639
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,760
that we made uh as part of our mpeg

640
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,799
iso bmf proposal

641
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,000
and we propose the following distinct

642
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,080
4cc codes for them once again these

643
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,559
codes are not registered yet but

644
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,520
the standardization pertaining to these

645
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
is ongoing

646
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,559
in in some cases and the plan is to

647
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,080
is to standardize these haptic coding

648
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,520
formats in the near future

649
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,360
the first one is hmpeg or hmpg

650
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,320
uh this is this would be the 4cc code

651
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,199
for the coding format that is chosen as

652
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,918
the winner

653
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
for the recently issued mpeg call for

654
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,440
proposals

655
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,880
on the quoted representation of haptics

656
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,360
this draft call was

657
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,120
issued at the uh at the october meeting

658
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,240
at the mpeg-132

659
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,879
the the final call is expected to be

660
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,559
issued at

661
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,159
a mpeg-133 in january and

662
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:09,440
the rm0 technology or

663
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,520
which is rm0 is mpeg-speak for the

664
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
coding format which wins the which means

665
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
the competition

666
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,000
that is expected to be to be selected at

667
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,760
the

668
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,039
april meeting at mpeg at mpeg-134

669
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:28,480
and the h-i-e-e is the is the

670
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:31,039
four cc code for the ieee p1918.1.1

671
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
vibro tactile coding standard which is

672
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,840
currently

673
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,520
under that under development as part of

674
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,559
the ieee

675
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,720
tactile internet initiative

676
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:45,120
and then the hnem is the enumerated

677
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,400
effects acting coding format that's

678
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,000
based on midi

679
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,400
and hivc is a audio to vibe

680
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,679
haptic coding format which basically

681
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,039
refers to the

682
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,320
uh growing area of automatic a

683
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:03,039
a to b or or audio to vibration

684
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,320
conversion algorithms uh so one

685
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,120
standardized these for

686
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,720
these formats will live as the subtypes

687
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,360
under the proposed haptic

688
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,360
top level media type next slide please

689
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,600
okay we have gotten this feedback

690
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,799
when we first put it in the on the media

691
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,480
types list

692
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:30,720
and from talking to uh others as well

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,919
but in our view haptics really doesn't

694
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,640
belong under any other media type and we

695
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,640
see the

696
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
following three reasons as the main

697
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,039
reason why the haptics

698
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
media type uh does not fit under the

699
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,760
application

700
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,559
top level type haptics

701
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
connects to a sensory system of a touch

702
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,879
or motion directly and is more specific

703
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,919
than the abstract application type

704
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,679
application

705
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
historically has been used for

706
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
applications that is code

707
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,640
which means it's viewed and treated with

708
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,360
great skill for security

709
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
hack pics is not code in in much the

710
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,199
same way

711
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,678
that audio and video are not core either

712
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,399
and haptics is a property of a media

713
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
stream

714
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,080
it's not an application under any normal

715
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,399
definition

716
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,320
as such i think it should be its own

717
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,520
type of media type

718
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,520
uh next slide please

719
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,320
this is a somewhat involved slide but i

720
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,080
felt it necessary to make these points

721
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,960
because we were told as part of the

722
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,158
instructions for rfcs that we need to be

723
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,159
very explicit uh so i'm going to try and

724
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,360
get just touch on that that the

725
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,320
highlights here

726
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,039
uh signal data is typically i mean

727
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,360
haptics data can be

728
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,480
can be represented as collections of

729
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,199
signal data

730
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,200
or it could be represented as

731
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,240
descriptive text in

732
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
xml or json or a similar format signal

733
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,679
data is

734
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,600
typically not executed by endpoint

735
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,159
processors so there is not much risk

736
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,639
there

737
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,159
but descriptive text is passed and

738
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,279
represented in memory

739
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,760
using xml data structures then this data

740
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,399
is

741
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,000
then further utilized uh to to to

742
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,719
construct one or more signals

743
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,760
which are then sent to the actuation

744
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,159
hardware

745
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,960
and because of the media rendering in

746
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
nature of the

747
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,880
data path for haptic coded data

748
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
you can you can think of the security

749
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,480
profile of haptic

750
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
data would be pretty consistent with the

751
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,120
security profile of

752
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,399
visual or audio media data so

753
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,199
there is some security risk but it's no

754
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,600
more

755
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
or no less than the security risk that

756
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
you need to be aware of when you're

757
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,240
dealing with audio

758
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,720
and and visual media data uh

759
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,000
and then media rendering systems are

760
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,559
normally implemented with a mix

761
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
of user and kernel space execution since

762
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,480
this media must

763
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,399
ultimately make their way to a

764
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,000
hard-based system so

765
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,799
in theory you could have a you could

766
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,840
have malicious instructions that are

767
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,080
present in the

768
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,480
descriptive haptic media and those could

769
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,520
execute arbitrary code in

770
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,200
kernel space uh effectively the

771
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,080
high passing system permission

772
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,440
structures or execution sandboxes

773
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,439
and so you so it all is so

774
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,559
haptics audio video and media data

775
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,720
widespread use

776
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,799
and careful attention need to be paid by

777
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,279
the operating system and device driver

778
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,039
implementers to ensure that the

779
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,919
synthesis and rendering parts

780
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,158
do not provide attack surfaces or

781
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,279
malicious

782
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,960
payloads uh any

783
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,200
coded representation of media haptic

784
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,080
media is insufficient to implicitly

785
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,039
provide sufficient security and this

786
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,600
protection

787
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,120
should really be enforced by the os

788
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,000
implementer

789
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,000
next slide please

790
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:07,440
okay now we are in the iana

791
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,440
considerations uh so here

792
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,960
when you say that haptics is a pre

793
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,919
primary media

794
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,720
content type it it implies that the

795
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,519
content

796
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
defined by it requires a certain haptic

797
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,519
subsystems

798
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,120
such as the low level haptics apis and

799
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,039
those in turn require hardware

800
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,678
capabilities such as one or more

801
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,679
actuators or vibration motors to

802
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
actually render the haptic media

803
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,840
now the haptic media type does not

804
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,679
provide any specific information about

805
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,039
the underlying data format or how that

806
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,240
haptics information should be

807
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,519
interpreted

808
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,880
those those subtypes defined within a

809
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,559
haptics tree

810
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,720
those would name the specific haptic

811
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,200
formats and if you have any

812
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,480
unrecognized subtypes of haptics those

813
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,000
should be treated as

814
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,840
application slash octet stream okay

815
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,120
next slide please okay

816
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,039
uh

817
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,199
the timing there were 20 minutes left in

818
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,399
the slot please be sure and leave

819
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:14,320
room for this right i am i am

820
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:18,000
about three slides away from being done

821
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:21,039
is that okay sure just uh

822
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,919
go a little fast okay all right did

823
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,879
this is a boilerplate stuff i mean the

824
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,039
registration

825
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
procedure if you worked with rfcs you

826
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,760
know what

827
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
happens here next slide please

828
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,159
okay the these are the last two slides i

829
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,600
believe

830
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,840
uh these are we we just give a gig give

831
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,120
examples of the i ids

832
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,879
haptic type uh it's uh the

833
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,360
subtype would be would be ivs and the

834
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,960
file extension would be dot ibs or dot

835
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,279
ivt

836
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,880
and this is and the device independent

837
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,679
haptic effect

838
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
coding i think the rest of the part uh i

839
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,760
will

840
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,679
let you read on your own time i will

841
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,279
point out one that there is a i would

842
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,559
point out though there is a published

843
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,240
specification

844
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,480
uh that was recently published by mpeg

845
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,440
unfortunately the mpeg website seems to

846
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,519
be

847
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:22,000
down or they are in the process of

848
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,519
updating so the link is not available

849
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,960
next slide please

850
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,519
this is the haptic format

851
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,159
so and the file extension would be dot

852
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,240
hacked

853
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,240
and this is a device dependent haptic

854
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
coding effect that's effect that's based

855
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,159
on the rif standard

856
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,320
the research the resource interchange

857
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,760
file format standard

858
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,000
and it's and yeah and that's

859
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,080
pretty much all i want to say about that

860
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,640
and i believe that brings me to the last

861
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,799
slide

862
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,799
next slide please that's it

863
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,080
any questions comments

864
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,840
critics

865
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,119
people in queue i seem to have forgotten

866
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:21,839
how to let them in

867
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,839
hang on one might think you're up

868
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,480
then you don't let them in directly

869
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,239
anymore just tell them to go and they

870
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,240
unmute their own audio

871
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,239
ah tim go ahead when you're ready

872
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,359
i just uh wanted to hear a couple of

873
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,240
scenarios where you'd send haptics data

874
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,520
over the wire

875
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,638
all by itself

876
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,079
okay uh the i i i think i've

877
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,720
given a few examples there but if you

878
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,400
in the case of streaming games and if

879
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,319
you wanted to send

880
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,359
the haptic the data by itself to

881
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,920
to the controller uh it will not have

882
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,720
any

883
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,920
audio or video because it's mainly meant

884
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,160
for your

885
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
controller which most likely has deals

886
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,078
with kinesthetic feedback

887
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,400
the other time where you can expect

888
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,440
haptics to be sent over the wire just by

889
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
itself

890
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,000
if if you had a wirelessly connected

891
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,040
bodysuit or a vest

892
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,359
for example i mean the the this might

893
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,160
seem a bit far-fetched but uh

894
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,359
in reality there were at least three or

895
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,598
four companies

896
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,799
at last year ces we which actually were

897
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,079
showing these kinds of

898
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,800
haptic bodysuits with up to between

899
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,800
12 and 12 to 24 different

900
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,839
actuators and the other one is

901
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,839
a if you want to pre cache effects for

902
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,839
ads or games

903
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,960
is is that that's also a

904
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,960
haptics only a use case

905
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,560
does that help answer the question

906
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,839
magnus i think you're up

907
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,440
um about does this uh

908
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,319
top level type going to imply that we

909
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,440
actually update six rsc 6381 on

910
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,920
on the codex parameters for container

911
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,640
file formats

912
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:50,160
uh are you talking about six

913
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,118
663 6381

914
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,040
so the codex parameter yeah for for

915
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,480
example we just use swedish base

916
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,920
media file formats so uh and and then

917
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,000
before

918
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
so this is the codex parameters i mean

919
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
you have the

920
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,118
fork iso cc performance for haptics

921
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,359
which

922
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,960
already this allows you to tell this is

923
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,839
container file with

924
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,280
these haptics types in it but that's do

925
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:18,799
we have a direction in the other way

926
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
that we need to do something about

927
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,320
okay i mean i will have to admit to not

928
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,119
having gone through 6381 but if you are

929
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,560
referring to

930
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,000
haptic codec specific parameters we do

931
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,880
envision those being being standardized

932
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,680
once the

933
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,640
mpeg cfp which deals specifically with

934
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,560
an mpeg

935
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,480
coding format standard once that

936
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,520
standard is finalized

937
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,560
in the in next april or in the june

938
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,960
that cut time frame so i would at that

939
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,320
point

940
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,320
i would envision 6381 to be needed to be

941
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,880
updated

942
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,760
okay uh yes look at it let's consider if

943
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,119
it's

944
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,800
we're gonna need to do something in the

945
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,680
other direction also actually updating

946
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,880
that format

947
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,839
if if this happens okay thank you

948
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,839
okay thank you

949
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,240
so this might be a good time to jump in

950
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,479
and remind folks to

951
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
try and be responsive to the fundamental

952
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,240
dispatch questions we're dealing with

953
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,040
as well as the the merits of the

954
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,160
proposal

955
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,400
so if we get fairly nuanced questions

956
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
um this might not be the right venue to

957
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
work them through

958
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,520
and actually what we're trying to do is

959
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,520
find the right venue so

960
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,320
so please be responsive to that question

961
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,320
as we explore this

962
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,480
merry christmas

963
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,040
hi this is center

964
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,040
you think about applications that use

965
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,720
media types

966
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,160
you know the idea that you could say

967
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,560
haptics blah

968
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,480
instead of application blah or

969
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,799
audioblock

970
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,160
you have to make up some new mime types

971
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
for the individual

972
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,399
formats because audio doesn't carry them

973
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,960
it does nothing in their character

974
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,720
but if you think about generic form

975
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,440
applications

976
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,200
that know that if something is audio

977
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,599
star

978
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,480
audio that they can do something with it

979
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,119
you know it has

980
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,160
timing that it lasts a certain amount of

981
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,880
time

982
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,319
and you can associate metadata with

983
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,560
portions of it

984
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,320
that you can mix it together with other

985
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,799
audio streams

986
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,680
to create a new kind of audio stream

987
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,920
and you can't do that with video and and

988
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,040
they wouldn't know about haptics

989
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:47,200
and you might be better off using audio

990
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,079
for haptics just to work in applications

991
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,240
like video editing applications and

992
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,280
final cut pro or

993
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,399
adobe premiere after effects

994
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,320
they would automatically take this as a

995
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,640
different kind of soundtrack

996
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,000
and fit it in whether or not it was

997
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,560
haptics

998
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,400
or audio but they'd have to add more

999
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,200
stuff that would know

1000
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,400
about haptics specifically is a

1001
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,399
top-level mind type

1002
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,960
okay i didn't hear you say

1003
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,598
you you gave a good justification for

1004
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,880
not using your application

1005
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,160
or video but i didn't hear uh about

1006
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,960
audio okay

1007
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,000
yeah i i can respond to your your

1008
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,079
questions and comments

1009
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,720
the first point is haptics is not

1010
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,839
typically encoded in the same way as as

1011
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,160
audio

1012
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,078
and point number two is that the the

1013
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,879
whole point of our

1014
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,640
mpeg iso bmf proposal which has

1015
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,079
progressed to the dam stage which is a

1016
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,440
draft amendment stage

1017
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,640
is to treat haptics as a first order

1018
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,240
media type

1019
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,040
at the same level as or audio

1020
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,040
and video and we actually have a working

1021
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,800
implementation of our proposal that

1022
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,720
works both on ios and android devices

1023
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,520
that shows that you could have an mp4

1024
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,640
file which now has three tracks

1025
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,040
and and as far as your

1026
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,240
pop pop point about the audio tools all

1027
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,359
of those tools

1028
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,799
use uh i mean they all

1029
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,078
ingest mp4 files now it is true that

1030
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,400
i mean once you have uh

1031
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,280
once you have haptics as part of the iso

1032
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,800
bmf

1033
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,480
the standard uh they did they are

1034
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,119
they are going to be a third track in an

1035
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,240
mp4 file and there might need to be

1036
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,119
changes

1037
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
to be made in the media player engine

1038
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,640
that now

1039
00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:00,079
recognizes the hacked box in in iso bmf

1040
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,879
in the iso bmf header and make allowance

1041
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,599
for that

1042
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,520
but that's just the progression of the

1043
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
standard it's no different than the next

1044
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,000
version of

1045
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,960
a any other and mpeg standard

1046
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,040
now that being the case the the the

1047
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,839
third point i would make is

1048
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,400
haptics is or in many cases like if you

1049
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,640
take the

1050
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,119
ahap format they have for

1051
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,240
format if you've ever looked at an ahab

1052
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,119
file it's actually

1053
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,520
a bunch of json so it's a very it's a

1054
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,680
very

1055
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,960
descriptive file format that basically

1056
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,078
says uh

1057
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,800
uh at what offset with respect to the

1058
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,200
audio

1059
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,160
timeline do you want to play out a

1060
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,960
haptic effect

1061
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,520
which could be a short click or a or a

1062
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,319
buzz

1063
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,160
or some kind of a transient and that and

1064
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,640
at what percentage strength you want

1065
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,960
that

1066
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,680
transient to be played so those kinds of

1067
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,839
things you

1068
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,640
you can't really do with a with an

1069
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,040
audio format and it's for those reasons

1070
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,240
we

1071
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,200
didn't want to shoot on a haptics into

1072
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,078
any of the existing or audio audio

1073
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,640
formats

1074
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,599
we felt that you could get the most

1075
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,078
flexibility

1076
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,680
and benefit from the growing field of

1077
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,560
haptics if it were its own

1078
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,560
top level type

1079
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:25,280
thank you swan um do you have

1080
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,359
um an opinion on

1081
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,720
how you think this could be best

1082
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,960
dispatched or are you really

1083
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,118
in a in a position where you really need

1084
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,560
advice on that

1085
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,200
uh i mean that seems like you are asking

1086
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,680
me if i know the procedure in ietf

1087
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,839
i mean i i would be looking to you for

1088
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,480
that i mean what is the

1089
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
what would you consider to be the next

1090
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,240
step

1091
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,400
i mean we we have we have we have made a

1092
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,560
case and we have we have addressed all

1093
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,920
of the comments we have gotten so far

1094
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,599
i really appreciate the thorough

1095
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,280
presentation i mean i think i asked the

1096
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,040
question just to make sure

1097
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,720
to refocus the conversation we're having

1098
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,440
on that dispatch question and to make

1099
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,759
sure

1100
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,280
you know if you had an opinion on that

1101
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,839
as some folks do when they're making

1102
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,440
their

1103
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,680
presentation so that was clear to the

1104
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,119
group um but i want to make sure

1105
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,440
i mean i i mean my my my question

1106
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,280
back to you i'm i'm i'm sorry to respond

1107
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,280
to a question with a question

1108
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,560
is what is needed to convince this group

1109
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,520
that this is a viable uh

1110
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,720
uh top level type and does the group

1111
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,079
think there is something else

1112
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,118
missing if not obviously we would like

1113
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,359
to

1114
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,119
take this to the next team so sure i

1115
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,359
mean fundamentally that will be driven

1116
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,359
through iatf consensus and the the

1117
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,078
purpose of this exercise here is just to

1118
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,319
get it into

1119
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,079
you know the room that will start making

1120
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,240
those forms we will not reach

1121
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,440
consensus and dispatch on the merits of

1122
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,759
it um

1123
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,800
so janna you're next if you can speak to

1124
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,160
this part of the question i would

1125
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:04,480
appreciate it we've only got about six

1126
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:09,279
minutes left here

1127
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:12,480
hi i can't hear you john jenna ingar

1128
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,079
yes yes yes

1129
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,359
okay um i i uh

1130
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,440
i was going to ask and is probably a

1131
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,400
question for the area directors or or

1132
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,599
or the other dispatch chairs um given

1133
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,800
that this draft has gone through one

1134
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,319
iteration and there's been

1135
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,680
presumably some engagement on the

1136
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:29,119
mailing list is what i gathered now i'm

1137
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,319
not paid attention to that

1138
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:34,800
but does it are there other

1139
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,119
folks besides immersion technologies

1140
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,280
that are interested presumably they are

1141
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,240
uh and are they willing to come here and

1142
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,839
engage

1143
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,839
uh at the idea the reason i ask this

1144
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:45,520
question is because this depends

1145
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,040
to me at least where this lands kind of

1146
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,560
depends on who the other parties that

1147
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,880
are interested are

1148
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,319
i can read the draft and and to me it

1149
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,520
makes sense to have haptics as a high

1150
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,720
level thing but

1151
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,960
it doesn't matter because i'm not the

1152
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,399
one building this stuff so i'm curious

1153
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,240
to hear there are others

1154
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
who have expressed interest in having a

1155
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,879
standard on this

1156
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,800
if they've expressed an interest in

1157
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
actually uh building

1158
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,319
through the standard word to be

1159
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,959
described because ultimately

1160
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,400
uh what you're trying to do is generate

1161
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,040
among people who are who are

1162
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,720
engaged on the details of the draft and

1163
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,880
for that you'd need people who are

1164
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,000
not just interested on the side but are

1165
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,079
actually implementing

1166
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,200
and deploying this stuff are there

1167
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,440
people like that

1168
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,439
um

1169
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,959
yeah i can i can respond to that

1170
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,480
uh there is actually an iet

1171
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,839
i mean an ieee effort which is ongoing

1172
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:44,240
and that that i as i mentioned it's the

1173
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:47,359
p191a which is a

1174
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,040
haptics codex for the tactile

1175
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,680
internet it is a and that that working

1176
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,560
group

1177
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,960
is actually in the process of finalizing

1178
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,799
the

1179
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,760
vibro tactile coding standard

1180
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,440
for for the haptic haptic vibrotactile

1181
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,960
coco coco coding standard

1182
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,160
as well as a kinesthetic haptic

1183
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,960
coding standard and so and they are a

1184
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,680
number of

1185
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,920
uh academic institutions as well as

1186
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,720
companies who are active there and

1187
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,480
they're actually

1188
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,839
actually implementing those two

1189
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,119
standards

1190
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:28,160
that is one apple has been

1191
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:31,920
is quite active in impact iso bmf

1192
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,319
in fact the chair of the a mpeg

1193
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,040
systems file format sub group is david

1194
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,440
singer

1195
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,079
he's from apple and apple has their own

1196
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,559
haptic

1197
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,480
format and they have actually been quite

1198
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,319
active because they have an interest

1199
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,160
they have a big business interest in

1200
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,160
haptics so they've been quite active in

1201
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,799
creating this

1202
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,759
mpeg cfp which i mentioned the call for

1203
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,760
proposals

1204
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:02,000
now outside of that a a a little bit of

1205
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,319
anecdotal evidence might be but we

1206
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,359
immersion uh founded what is known as

1207
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,960
haptics

1208
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:11,200
what is known as the haptics industry

1209
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:14,160
forum which has now grown to over 50

1210
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,200
companies in the haptic space and they

1211
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,759
are all

1212
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,040
happy in that area okay yes one i don't

1213
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,839
want to cut you off but i think we're

1214
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,440
gonna have no i'm

1215
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,960
i'm done move this along so um

1216
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,160
stefan just jumped into the end that'll

1217
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,920
have to be the end of the queue i'm

1218
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,359
gonna ask people to be

1219
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,440
real quick i think we're gonna be okay

1220
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:32,720
on overall agenda time but we do need to

1221
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,359
wrap this up

1222
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,359
um so spencer you're next

1223
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,200
thank you so the uh the thing i'm seeing

1224
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,839
in the chat is basically

1225
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:48,720
you know this is a top level

1226
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,599
registration so maybe

1227
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,118
a uh working group is appropriate for a

1228
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,520
short-lived working group

1229
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,040
is appropriate for that does anybody

1230
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,079
disagree with that

1231
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,079
then i'll get out of the queue

1232
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,520
so i i believe barry has made and

1233
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,559
offered a d sponsor on a couple of

1234
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,920
occasions

1235
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,760
i'd appreciate if maybe he would get in

1236
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,319
the queue and and give his

1237
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,319
his view on this as well but meanwhile

1238
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
richard

1239
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,839
you with me richard hey yeah it's just

1240
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,680
busy granting permission prompts

1241
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,599
um real quick comment here i think this

1242
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,040
is a very natural 80 sponsor i think we

1243
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,960
should not waste the bandwidth the

1244
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,720
stabilization working group on this

1245
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,319
uh ietf last call in the ensuing

1246
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,640
discussion will be plenty to nail down

1247
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:37,599
any

1248
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,200
any of the questions that have been

1249
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:45,839
raised here that's it

1250
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,839
brass tacks i love it pete

1251
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,839
no audio pete

1252
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,240
we'll come back or we'll get your

1253
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,200
comments reload

1254
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,200
mo are you available

1255
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:15,520
um i think the top level

1256
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,839
uh type makes sense uh so i do support

1257
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,680
that

1258
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,920
on the question of where to dispatch to

1259
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,000
is there any point in a work group

1260
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,079
i think the relevant question is what do

1261
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,240
you plan to do beyond the top level type

1262
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,079
do you plan to have any of these uh

1263
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,279
elementary stream formats

1264
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,240
uh standardized within itf or do you

1265
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,319
plan to have

1266
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:39,200
uh payload formats um in in avt core

1267
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,079
carrying these um or do you plan to

1268
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,439
describe them

1269
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,800
in sdp and then music i think that would

1270
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,280
make it more relevant

1271
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,800
of what level of integration this has

1272
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,480
with other itf work

1273
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:57,839
other than just the top level type

1274
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,079
okay uh i can try to

1275
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,960
answer that i mean at least one of the

1276
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,079
four

1277
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,839
uh formats we which have mentioned

1278
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,800
is not going to be under ietf it's going

1279
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,400
to be done by ieee and the second one

1280
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,240
the hmpg will

1281
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,839
probably fall out of the work that's

1282
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,640
ongoing in

1283
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,200
mpeg which leaves the remaining two the

1284
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,799
he

1285
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,279
m and the havc those are

1286
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,400
possibilities for standardization under

1287
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
ietf

1288
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,760
but i can't speak to them just yet

1289
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
because we don't know how it's going to

1290
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,839
go

1291
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,319
with the first two and one personal

1292
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,119
comment

1293
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,558
is there any format that supports

1294
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,160
spatial haptics

1295
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,160
uh encoded along with the video stream

1296
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,598
so that you have spatially and

1297
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,000
dynamically

1298
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,720
variant haptic fields is that

1299
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,079
standardized anywhere

1300
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,680
not yet but but it's interesting

1301
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,480
you should bring up spatial haptics

1302
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,200
because that is part of phase two

1303
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,839
of our mpeg cfp and it's so under the

1304
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,960
overall

1305
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:04,640
umbrella of mpi or mpeg in

1306
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:06,240
immersive media so once phase two of the

1307
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,799
ccfp is over we do

1308
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,839
expect something on spatial haptics to

1309
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,000
be standardized

1310
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,279
but but it's probably the short answer

1311
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,160
to your question is

1312
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,160
it's too early to say

1313
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,839
so i'm going to jump in real quick with

1314
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,359
pete's comment from earlier that he was

1315
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,440
unable to make

1316
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,480
uh which is that he doesn't think a work

1317
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,040
group is necessary

1318
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,000
that a.d sponsored would be uh

1319
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,839
reasonable

1320
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,119
and some of the commentary we've seen in

1321
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,640
the

1322
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,240
chat is along the lines that a.d

1323
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,160
sponsoring plus

1324
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,000
calling out to the right experts as a

1325
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,680
way to approach it

1326
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,960
that's not my opinion that's that's just

1327
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,680
that's relaying stuff i'm seeing in the

1328
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,280
chat

1329
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,399
that's great thank you ben stefan is

1330
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,480
next um

1331
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
cullen you jumped in the queue after the

1332
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,680
queue was closed so i'm gonna

1333
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,920
cut you but we do appreciate our

1334
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,680
america's chairs in any event

1335
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,640
stefan so um

1336
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,680
two things one is i'm supportive of

1337
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,879
getting this

1338
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,839
top-level domain done that's my personal

1339
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,960
comment

1340
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:13,520
one comment as idf listen to

1341
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:16,319
mpeg this activity

1342
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,480
is by no means the most active but also

1343
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:21,279
by no means the quietest

1344
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,480
that mpac has there is a significant

1345
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,520
amount of

1346
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,400
industry interest visible that goes well

1347
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,079
beyond

1348
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,079
one startup company thank you

1349
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,240
and we have barry and murray left in the

1350
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,240
queue as our ids

1351
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:45,599
yes um i i think this is

1352
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,319
uh the the the primary discussion of

1353
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,359
this will be

1354
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,599
on the uh media types list i think we

1355
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,319
don't need a working group to do this

1356
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,079
but i think i i do want to defer to the

1357
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,200
community for the decision on that

1358
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,000
so uh i'm hearing mostly

1359
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,279
people thinking ad sponsored is fine and

1360
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,599
i'm good with that

1361
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,559
and murray being next he'll he'll he'll

1362
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,240
tell you whether

1363
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:10,160
he's willing to be the sponsor or not

1364
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:14,160
and he's a media type reviewer

1365
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,160
anyway so i'm done

1366
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,200
yeah i'm happy to sponsors if that's the

1367
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,559
uh if that's the cons

1368
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,399
but the community wants to handle this

1369
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,640
it's fine with me

1370
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,640
great

1371
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,800
so the chairs are huddling in our chat i

1372
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,558
think we're

1373
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,680
we're hearing that that is the

1374
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,400
most common view um and are leaning

1375
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,279
towards

1376
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,040
uh suggest uh suggesting that as the

1377
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,640
rough consensus outcome of this meeting

1378
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,558
does anyone want to stand up and say

1379
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,000
that that's uh doesn't match what

1380
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,920
they've heard

1381
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,599
go ahead colin so yeah i would like to

1382
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,280
have a chance to speak please as i was

1383
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,040
in the queue before the tool dropped me

1384
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,880
for the second time

1385
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,680
is that okay yeah go ahead so

1386
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,640
uh i think that this is draft is going

1387
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,919
to require

1388
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,598
i mean so first of all i think we should

1389
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,880
do this okay no question about we should

1390
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:09,520
move forward with some sort of topical

1391
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,119
type

1392
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,480
but the hint of magnus's question

1393
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,440
several other peoples that have worked

1394
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,040
in this space before

1395
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,640
has been like there's some really

1396
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,558
complicated tradeoffs because nothing's

1397
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,720
perfect in this space the audio plus

1398
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,480
video is already a disaster to explain

1399
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:25,598
when you use one and when use the other

1400
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,480
and this is going to expand that and i

1401
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,799
think that

1402
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,880
it's not that this drafts complicated

1403
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,640
it's that the set of contradictory rules

1404
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,319
we've already set up in this space

1405
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,078
is going to be complicated and there's

1406
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,680
going to be no way to get this draft to

1407
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,599
meet every single one of our existing

1408
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,759
rules simultaneously

1409
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,200
and i think that that complexity is one

1410
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,480
of the reasons that

1411
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,078
i would argue that given we already have

1412
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,040
very experienced media type people

1413
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:51,280
expressed

1414
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,799
that this shouldn't even be done at ietf

1415
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,280
you may not want to have that whole

1416
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,799
conversation on the itf last call list

1417
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,799
which is where it's going to end up if

1418
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,240
you 80 sponsor it now it's clearly the

1419
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,839
ads call whether they want to sponsor or

1420
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,919
not it's not even a matter of dispatch

1421
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,279
dispatch has no input on whether it

1422
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,799
chooses a sponsor yet

1423
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,680
but i think the ads should think about

1424
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,680
that conversation

1425
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,559
and i think we need to have a way of

1426
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,880
making sure we get consent get people

1427
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,079
involved when the tools broken like we

1428
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,319
need something better here this isn't

1429
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,319
working

1430
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,839
all right well i'm already cleared

1431
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:31,839
himself out of the queue

1432
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,480
ben christie do you have anything you

1433
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,200
want to add to the wrap up here is this

1434
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,400
a

1435
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,919
case where we need to uh consult the

1436
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,319
minutes and write a summary of where

1437
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,119
we're at i

1438
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,000
what i would take uh this has been i

1439
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,520
think

1440
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,200
with cullen's last comment there and it

1441
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,480
it probably makes sense this is a com

1442
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,000
the dispatch conversation needs to

1443
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,280
continue

1444
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,520
uh because i don't think we've

1445
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,599
necessarily reached a resolution

1446
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,799
uh so we probably need some discussion

1447
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,280
but among the uh

1448
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:06,079
authors chairs and area directors in the

1449
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,119
uh

1450
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:13,839
very short very in the very near future

1451
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,359
and and see if we can resolve that but i

1452
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:19,040
don't hear a resolution

1453
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:21,279
right now between um 80 sponsored

1454
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,279
and

1455
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,959
some other higher wages presumably a new

1456
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,799
working group

1457
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,720
um i agree i think we should continue to

1458
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:33,359
have that discussion and um

1459
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,160
further input on the list is um i think

1460
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,160
appropriate right

1461
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,160
i'd like to stick one quick thing in in

1462
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:43,919
response to culinary

1463
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:44,319
um yeah i suppose and the ads can decide

1464
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,119
to

1465
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,799
ad sponsor anything they want to but one

1466
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,839
of the reasons we have dispatches

1467
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,759
exactly so

1468
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:53,200
we will listen to what dispatch has to

1469
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,359
say about these things

1470
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,919
so thanks for your comments on that and

1471
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:00,078
yeshwand i want to make it clear to you

1472
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,200
that um the message i'm getting from

1473
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,040
this is

1474
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,040
we're going to do this it's just a

1475
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,680
question of what do it in a new working

1476
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,480
group

1477
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,839
or just with ad sponsorship and that's

1478
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,040
the only thing that we have to decide at

1479
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,520
this point

1480
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,319
okay and so i'm going i'm assuming that

1481
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,240
i will

1482
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:20,240
i will find out soon enough from one of

1483
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,240
you gentlemen as to what the direction

1484
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,839
is

1485
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,119
yeah we'll be in touch please also you

1486
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,920
know read the to specialists but we'll

1487
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,680
certainly be different

1488
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,799
yes absolutely with you as as awesome

1489
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,078
okay just for the sake of agenda time we

1490
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:39,440
need to move on

1491
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:42,640
uh sergio are you with us yes hello

1492
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:46,079
there you are hi hello is your

1493
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,078
shout out next slide

1494
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,240
yeah that's a slide please

1495
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,240
okay so webrtc is still the the best

1496
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:05,520
media transfer

1497
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,399
used for streaming real time and audio

1498
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,079
and video

1499
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:12,319
but while it is possible to use other

1500
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,920
transport for ingesting webrtc content

1501
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:17,200
into a media server

1502
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,559
when using webrtc both for ingesting and

1503
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,759
delivering the

1504
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,760
the media allows stream to have several

1505
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,839
good properties but mainly you can work

1506
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,799
on browsers for both

1507
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:29,279
the publishing side and the viewer side

1508
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,599
you

1509
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,319
avoid to have protocol translation

1510
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,559
between

1511
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,920
something that it is not webrtc into

1512
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,040
webrtc

1513
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,520
this you have to do that you will most

1514
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,440
probably

1515
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,520
cause delay and have to

1516
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,440
increase the complexity of the

1517
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,359
implementation because you already are

1518
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,520
supporting webrtc for

1519
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,200
for streaming out so implementing

1520
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,280
something different for assuming

1521
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,720
and doing the protocol translation is is

1522
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,079
going to cause

1523
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,839
more more will will

1524
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:04,160
be more difficult to implement i just

1525
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:08,160
have webrtc foreign

1526
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:11,200
and in most

1527
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,720
you will most probably have a protocol

1528
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,319
then

1529
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,319
problems do with the codes for example

1530
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,078
rtmp does not support opus at all so you

1531
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,799
will have to do

1532
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,160
transcoding between other codecs and and

1533
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:27,440
the codex that

1534
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:30,480
a webrtc supports and also

1535
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,119
some feature that they are webrtc only

1536
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,640
are

1537
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,319
you will not be able to support it

1538
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,078
end-to-end for example some servers may

1539
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:40,079
decide to just do

1540
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:43,839
a rtxor or flag or or effect

1541
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:46,480
end-to-end just from whatever the the

1542
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:48,799
the the sender supports that the

1543
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,920
producer support to the viewer so

1544
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:53,440
if you are doing other different

1545
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,520
you are using other protocols for

1546
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,720
ingesting media that that november

1547
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,400
decision

1548
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,680
some of these features are lost

1549
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,040
so however if there is no current

1550
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,960
uh standard signaling protocol that it

1551
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,319
is say available to do this i mean the

1552
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,920
most laws could be

1553
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:16,079
simple like mpp

1554
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,240
but they are not used for broadcasting

1555
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,520
or streaming services and there is no

1556
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,520
sign at all of any kind of um of

1557
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,559
industrial option also they are complex

1558
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:28,960
implement

1559
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:30,000
so it is they will not likely be in use

1560
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,119
at all

1561
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,040
and in rtsp that this

1562
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:37,280
could be the closest that we can have

1563
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,040
for the broadcasting industry

1564
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,720
and is not compatible with rtc sdp of an

1565
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:47,040
asset model and also

1566
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:49,759
a for for publishing the rtcp

1567
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,000
record and doing a push from our rtcp

1568
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:57,599
server is not very widely supported so

1569
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,839
the consequence is that now it's

1570
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,799
its service has its own implementation

1571
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,000
of the of

1572
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,559
uh custom adult protocols so you want to

1573
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,839
have

1574
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,559
an encoder that supports several several

1575
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:12,240
webrtc instrument services each way you

1576
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,640
will have to implement

1577
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,319
a one protocol for one let's see a

1578
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,160
streaming service so this is not

1579
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,759
probably that it is going so something

1580
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,279
that is going to happen

1581
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,440
so at least in our opinion do we

1582
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,119
the the consequences that we need a new

1583
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,960
reference signaling protocol for this

1584
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:35,839
use case

1585
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:35,839
so let's slice this

1586
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,720
so what would be the requirements from

1587
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,359
this new streaming protocol

1588
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,558
i mean it needs to be simple and simple

1589
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,920
to implement

1590
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,200
and also simply to to use i mean and to

1591
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,520
be able to set the table

1592
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,399
or to provision an encoder with this new

1593
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,520
protocol

1594
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,119
it will have to be as easy as you have

1595
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:00,160
now with an rtp

1596
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:03,760
a rtmp uh uri so

1597
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:07,359
you will not have to do i you

1598
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,480
should only be need to to point your

1599
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:12,720
um your encoder with an uri

1600
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,880
and have the the streaming and the

1601
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:19,200
streaming up

1602
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:22,880
uh the and for ingesting the uk

1603
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,759
is quite specific so um

1604
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,319
it is only required to you only require

1605
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,039
to

1606
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:30,799
to implement a set of webrtc

1607
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,960
functionality

1608
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:35,280
mainly that you only need to support

1609
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:37,440
only the directional flows from

1610
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,520
from the from the encoder to the to them

1611
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,559
into the media server

1612
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,880
typically the server is assumed is is

1613
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,960
not

1614
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,440
like in the typical webrtc use case that

1615
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,319
you have peer-to-peers ball behind that

1616
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,319
i mean in

1617
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:52,160
in in if you are broadcasting to a

1618
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:52,799
server the server is assumed either to

1619
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,200
have

1620
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,480
a public ip or is deployed in the same

1621
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,200
private a

1622
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,480
private network as the publisher so the

1623
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:03,680
network the the

1624
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,960
the not restriction is is is

1625
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:08,799
less um difficult in in normal web

1626
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,039
participate to appear

1627
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:13,440
and also you don't need to to support a

1628
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,720
negotiation that you are not going to

1629
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,119
for example in rtmp or other protocols

1630
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,000
that i

1631
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,680
use for ingesting today you just send

1632
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,319
the media from the start and if you want

1633
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,399
to change

1634
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,440
things yes stop and restart again you

1635
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,799
don't need to support renegotiation

1636
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,359
so um in

1637
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:34,880
the requirements really has to be a full

1638
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,920
compliance with rtc

1639
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,280
and rtc web specs and must support

1640
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,880
authentication of the

1641
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,799
for the for the stream has to be

1642
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,599
both subletting web browsers and knight

1643
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,599
different colors

1644
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,210
and if possible lower the requirement

1645
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,400
readings on

1646
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:55,359
[Music]

1647
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,319
to be able to be supported easily by our

1648
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:58,319
encoders

1649
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:00,240
by reducing some kind of functionalities

1650
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:02,240
that we have in webrtc's are reducing

1651
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:05,038
the the number of

1652
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,520
or the the possibilities that some

1653
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:11,280
options that we have from webrtc

1654
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:14,640
and to just narrow down the use case

1655
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,480
and also to be able to to easily support

1656
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,558
load balancing and restoration

1657
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:23,359
to to be able to handle massive loads of

1658
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,520
of a stream into a into an streaming

1659
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:29,598
service

1660
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,599
so next slide please

1661
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,319
so that the profit the proposition

1662
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,598
solution is something that it is

1663
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:43,920
really really simple it is just a

1664
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:47,200
doing an http with an sdp offer

1665
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,079
to from from the encoder to to the media

1666
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,799
server

1667
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,599
and receiving the sap answer from the

1668
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,960
from the

1669
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:58,240
from the from the media server with this

1670
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:02,160
sdp offer asset you set up a webrtc

1671
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,759
and a session so then you so manage you

1672
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:07,598
yes

1673
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,599
establish the ice and get the less

1674
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,960
connectivity and from then on you will

1675
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,760
you

1676
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,640
control the the state of the publication

1677
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,000
with

1678
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:21,440
the isan dtls

1679
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:23,520
states so

1680
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,559
you use you will use ice content

1681
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,839
freshness for the testing if the

1682
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,240
if the if the connection or the encoder

1683
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,640
has

1684
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,520
abruptly disconnected from the encoder

1685
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:36,720
or the

1686
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:40,319
media server and you also

1687
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,759
use the dtls teardown in order to know

1688
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:47,038
when the session has been uh normally

1689
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:50,640
terminated normally by any other of

1690
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:53,599
those both sides a authentication bay

1691
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,118
will be a an authorization will be

1692
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,160
supported

1693
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:00,720
natively by http a

1694
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,680
header under the adopted doctorization

1695
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:05,439
header with a

1696
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:09,038
video token so it is just exactly what

1697
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:12,720
um i mean a standard http

1698
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:15,680
stuff and also you will use you will

1699
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,240
it will support http radiations for load

1700
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:18,240
balancing

1701
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,559
so next slides please

1702
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,599
this is an example implementation of

1703
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:33,119
javascript in javascript i mean it is

1704
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,160
you can see you can get more simple than

1705
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:38,960
that

1706
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,960
and you just need to to set up the the

1707
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:42,240
the track yes you create apple

1708
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,520
connection and you

1709
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:48,399
get the the offer just to do

1710
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,319
a fetch with it then for sending the

1711
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:53,440
post to the media server receive the

1712
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:53,839
the answer and and pass it that they

1713
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,920
said

1714
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,000
remote description and once it is set

1715
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,400
and you can control the

1716
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,760
the state of the of the feed with just

1717
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,640
by the

1718
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,319
the on connecting state changes events

1719
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:10,400
received so you have the connected

1720
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:13,680
disconnected failed and closed

1721
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:13,680
so let's like this

1722
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,759
we have tried to

1723
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,000
reduce the complexity mainly because if

1724
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:27,358
it is going to be

1725
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,960
implemented by the by

1726
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:34,239
native encoders and hardware-based say

1727
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,960
solutions i mean trying to reduce the

1728
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,559
the requirements for implementing it was

1729
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,759
important so

1730
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,239
we have restricted that that um in a way

1731
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,120
that

1732
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,678
well first the stp bundle is always

1733
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,640
required and rtcp maxine so we don't

1734
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,560
support

1735
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:56,640
nonviolent num bonding and also

1736
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,839
no rtcp in different boards

1737
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:03,040
and the server may implement

1738
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:06,799
a slide and the codeman implements

1739
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:10,158
must implement full full eyes

1740
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:12,399
and the the other minor

1741
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,679
change that we haven't done is that we

1742
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,559
allow the

1743
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,279
the encoder to just set up then

1744
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,359
implement the

1745
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,600
the active setup so not to have to

1746
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:24,159
implement active and paste it

1747
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,719
and the server must support both at a

1748
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,759
thin

1749
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:31,520
um as a

1750
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:34,880
only as a spaces fan in case that

1751
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,199
for example if they connect they are

1752
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,799
interconnecting with something that is

1753
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:41,439
supporting also at

1754
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,158
past because it can has to support

1755
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:46,238
atheist

1756
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,238
or basic i mean we

1757
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:53,440
if there is any other and

1758
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:55,199
other um optionality that we're going to

1759
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,080
remove from current web artists in order

1760
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:59,440
to

1761
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:01,600
to to make it easier to implement i mean

1762
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,120
it will be welcome but this is only the

1763
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,840
the ones that we have

1764
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:12,800
a phone for now and i think that

1765
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,800
it may be my last slide yeah

1766
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:20,000
so the the conclusion is this that

1767
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:23,759
it is i think this is the the lowest

1768
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,199
thing that we can have for having webrtc

1769
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:30,480
uh a easy protocol with

1770
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,639
the the with a

1771
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,400
standard that already available so it is

1772
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,239
just use them

1773
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,400
and in order to create something that it

1774
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:41,759
is really simple and really

1775
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:44,639
uh easy to implement

1776
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,760
there has been some discussion if this

1777
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,239
should be

1778
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,159
a make a bit more complex to have and to

1779
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:53,759
be able to control the state of this

1780
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:55,759
this the of the stream by http rest or

1781
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,360
something like that but

1782
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,159
this is the the bare minimum that it is

1783
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,519
that it is required to in order to to

1784
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:07,679
have this same

1785
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,679
working and with um

1786
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:12,000
yeah now as a thank you for all that

1787
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,719
before we open the queue

1788
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,239
do you would you like to address the uh

1789
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,040
the core dispatch question

1790
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,480
um are you familiar with the possible

1791
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,159
locations for this work

1792
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,080
um or should we open the queue

1793
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:26,480
suggestions on that from the floor

1794
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:27,360
i'm i'm not aware what is the best scene

1795
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,040
i mean

1796
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,880
i think that this is really simple i

1797
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,120
mean the draft is available and

1798
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,640
it is really small so i think that the

1799
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,040
the

1800
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:41,280
at least my my opinion should be that

1801
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:44,320
you should be the the whatever is

1802
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,000
best for for having a fast solution

1803
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,440
and i don't expect to have much

1804
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,320
discussion i mean

1805
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:51,519
i would not like to have to get this to

1806
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,000
grow much more than

1807
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:57,360
what it is so obviously address concerns

1808
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,360
and things like that but not

1809
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,120
make this much more complex that it is

1810
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,159
today

1811
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:09,840
okay great is there any commentary from

1812
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:09,839
the group

1813
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,320
bernard please

1814
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,040
uh sergio i mean as you said you showed

1815
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,679
this is a very simple

1816
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,199
web page you know it's probably not a

1817
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,560
lot more complicated on the server

1818
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,678
either

1819
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,679
so i guess my question would be why you

1820
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,400
need to standardize the protocol given

1821
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:37,360
that this

1822
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,280
you know you just showed us the

1823
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,320
javascript for it and you could

1824
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:44,719
implement this pretty easily

1825
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,239
mainly because if i going to to speak to

1826
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:49,040
a hardware encoder

1827
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,678
a band to implement it i need to to say

1828
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,640
please

1829
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,520
implement it so it is possible to use it

1830
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,000
with

1831
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,159
a more than one service i mean i already

1832
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,239
have implemented it but

1833
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:01,519
if it is not a standard it would be just

1834
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,959
another thing that

1835
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:07,280
and that my server implements but

1836
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,960
no other server implements so if we can

1837
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,840
agree that having this

1838
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,880
as a specification within the encoder

1839
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,840
well

1840
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,400
they're going to can be say that i just

1841
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,520
need to

1842
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:22,799
i just super whip and

1843
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:26,000
i mean it's a just

1844
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:29,199
to try to be able to to

1845
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,880
to have this more how to broaden the

1846
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,799
adoption of it yeah so basically you

1847
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,239
don't have control necessarily over the

1848
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,280
server so it's not like you could write

1849
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:39,440
your own

1850
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,360
you know python or node.js server you

1851
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,919
you're trying to get somebody else

1852
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,839
who has kind of a okay i think i

1853
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,840
understand it now

1854
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,440
harold

1855
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:02,400
uh thank you hello elvis john

1856
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:05,760
google i think this

1857
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,759
makes perfect sense the point of having

1858
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,880
a document

1859
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:16,080
is really to have an online

1860
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:18,320
stable reference for it

1861
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,920
there are a number of cases where people

1862
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,199
tend to

1863
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:25,440
not want to incorporate

1864
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,879
someone's bright idea or someone's

1865
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:30,799
unmaintained

1866
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:34,640
npm or something so having a stable

1867
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:39,360
reference for a really simple protocol

1868
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:42,800
is probably a good idea

1869
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,000
i mean karen and i were trying to do

1870
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,560
something like this

1871
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:50,560
way back when that uh failed

1872
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,040
or it failed to get gain traction at the

1873
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,560
time probably because we were trying to

1874
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,280
incorporate it into the spec

1875
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:59,120
instead of just having it that's a minor

1876
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:03,040
item

1877
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:03,040
so i think we should

1878
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:10,719
just let this be published i think

1879
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,360
informational publication as city

1880
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:16,800
sponsored would be fine

1881
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,799
so let's go

1882
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,719
yeah so i think that i may not have

1883
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,280
answered probably or

1884
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,000
very carefully to today completely to

1885
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:26,480
the bernard

1886
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,520
question before i mean that the

1887
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,919
situation in in

1888
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,360
web in streaming is different with that

1889
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,400
in common

1890
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,559
webrtc cases that you have one vertical

1891
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:39,040
that you control the clients and the

1892
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,920
and the streaming services typically in

1893
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,960
streaming

1894
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,679
you will have a hardware encoders that

1895
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,120
are

1896
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:49,840
nor are even that works

1897
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,280
is for example with a with you support

1898
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,280
rtmp

1899
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,280
you just implement rtmp and you are able

1900
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:59,040
to talk to facebook to twitch

1901
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:01,040
to to a broad range of

1902
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,800
of service so the idea is here is the

1903
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,239
same to be able to

1904
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:09,679
to have it in for example in in obs or

1905
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:11,120
in in the vendor for the for the encoder

1906
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,239
is different that the one that is

1907
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:15,840
deploying in the

1908
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:19,280
the streaming service so if it is it is

1909
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:21,520
as hara has said having a common spec

1910
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,400
it allows to to people to be more

1911
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,560
comfortable

1912
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:26,719
when implementing something that they

1913
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,800
know that they will be able to use

1914
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:34,080
and connect to uh to any webrtc services

1915
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,159
and instead of now that that

1916
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,440
if i have to toggle with a vendor to

1917
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,159
implement my

1918
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:41,199
a protocol they say well why i have to

1919
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,920
implement it

1920
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,400
for you if it is only going to work with

1921
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,080
your

1922
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:51,360
streaming service

1923
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,719
victor oh and bernard you're still

1924
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,639
in the queue if you want to be in the

1925
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,800
queue stay there if um it's just

1926
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,719
leftover

1927
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:03,199
oh can you hear me yes uh i guess

1928
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,280
my main question is what the

1929
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,639
implementation experience status for

1930
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:11,440
this especially

1931
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:14,719
for clients that are not web

1932
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:16,080
it is yeah it is already implemented in

1933
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:19,520
both in in

1934
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:22,800
in janus and and in medusa i mean in in

1935
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:24,800
in our in the melica's

1936
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,080
streaming platform and we have

1937
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,520
implemented in

1938
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,719
in an obs fork that we are trying to to

1939
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,640
get into

1940
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,280
to the main one but the complexity is

1941
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,239
having to is compiling the delivery of

1942
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:38,800
rtc

1943
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,400
but a part of the web browser we have

1944
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,880
already been in in obs

1945
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,480
and trying to get traction with the

1946
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,600
people that it is implemented in

1947
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,599
in however encoders

1948
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,080
uh and the second more of a clarifying

1949
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,790
question the understands that the urls

1950
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:58,470
for this are https

1951
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:58,470
[Music]

1952
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:04,400
yeah the url is just an https url

1953
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,120
um i just wanted to say i i think this

1954
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,280
is a good

1955
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:16,480
uh good thing we should be doing i think

1956
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,519
there's some

1957
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,639
still discussion to be had on how much

1958
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,320
simpler it could be

1959
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,239
i think there's still some optionalities

1960
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,440
that could be taken out so

1961
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:29,440
i kind of think that publishing it as is

1962
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:31,519
might it needs another round of

1963
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,559
discussion in terms of the detail from

1964
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,080
my point of view but

1965
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:41,840
i i think it's eminently implementable

1966
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:41,840
even as it is

1967
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,000
jonathan

1968
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:59,679
intended this is intended to be a um

1969
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,360
i know you wrote a a replacement

1970
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,800
you know flash standardization

1971
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,159
replacement for

1972
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,320
our rpmp is this feature equivalent to

1973
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:09,839
rtmp has used um

1974
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,599
because one thing i did notice is it

1975
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,840
didn't seem other than

1976
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,159
you know the stp proper it didn't seem

1977
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,920
as you wrote it terribly extensible

1978
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,320
so i'm a little concerned about that but

1979
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,159
i'm also going to ask you know is

1980
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:24,159
is there anything that rtmp you know

1981
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,599
does as used that

1982
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,759
this doesn't do and if so where would

1983
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,560
you think the extension points

1984
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,560
would properly be

1985
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,480
i have not understood the question could

1986
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:38,239
you please repeat so is is this

1987
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,239
feature is this protocol as you've

1988
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,599
described that does it do everything

1989
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:44,080
that rtmp

1990
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,080
does we know your goal is to replace

1991
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,960
rdmp

1992
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,400
yeah well the goal is not to replace and

1993
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,120
rtmp

1994
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,599
i mean rtmp or the other broadcasting

1995
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,599
protocol

1996
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:01,040
can that will be and use for different

1997
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,400
things i mean i don't expect this to

1998
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,199
replace

1999
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,400
and the current broadcasting solution

2000
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:08,480
for ngs

2001
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:10,320
but um the problem is that if for

2002
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:13,280
example if you use rtmp for

2003
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,599
webrtc first you are adding delay

2004
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,599
because

2005
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,920
you will have to to wake in in the best

2006
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,920
case

2007
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:23,120
when you don't have a buffet on the on

2008
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,440
the encoder side

2009
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:27,599
you will have to to have professor frame

2010
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,879
before you start doing the packetization

2011
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:33,120
and the for example rtmp does not

2012
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,719
support opus so you will have to do

2013
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:38,320
and transcoding from from aac to opus

2014
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,239
so this is something that and i want to

2015
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,599
avoid first yeah

2016
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:46,718
rtmp does not support iframe requests so

2017
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,800
i mean there is so i guess that makes

2018
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,639
sense to me i guess my question is

2019
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,080
are going the other direction if

2020
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:53,040
somebody did want to say okay that

2021
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,800
sounds great

2022
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,080
i'm going to take my exis thing that's

2023
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:59,120
using

2024
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,519
you know um rtmp for this and replace it

2025
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,760
with

2026
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,760
whip would there be things that would

2027
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,719
run into that you'd say oh well

2028
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:09,679
i do need to i can't do this in web this

2029
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:11,440
thing that i'm doing today

2030
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,440
i don't know i mean the the main goal is

2031
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:16,719
to have webrtc and from end to end

2032
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:19,040
so i i i don't know if

2033
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,320
this makes sense for example to ingest

2034
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:24,159
from in webrtc

2035
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:26,480
and and do hls out

2036
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:28,239
i mean probably it can make sense i

2037
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,839
don't know how that's compared to other

2038
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:32,959
solutions that they all ended

2039
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:37,840
but if you are done trying to do webrtc

2040
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:40,000
uh for webrtc in jason webrtc out

2041
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,600
there is no other solution that that

2042
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,400
really works i mean for example if you

2043
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,440
want to

2044
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,440
to use uh

2045
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,960
for example let's say if you want to

2046
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:54,000
stream out again

2047
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,880
a dc conference from our browsers and

2048
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,159
then

2049
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,679
you the scream in one of the

2050
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:00,239
participants and trying to ingest it

2051
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:04,239
into

2052
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:06,320
a cdn to deliver it as a as um

2053
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:08,320
as webrtc i don't think that there is

2054
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:11,519
any any other way to do it

2055
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:14,799
that they said ingesting webrtc

2056
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:18,000
okay uh we'll have to cut the

2057
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,920
queue after mo um and ted before you

2058
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,800
start sergio can just get some clarity

2059
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,239
on

2060
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,840
um how much development work uh ietf

2061
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:27,678
contribution do you think

2062
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,199
needs to be done here as opposed to is

2063
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:31,199
this say um

2064
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,320
a static or informational document

2065
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:33,759
you're really looking

2066
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,840
you're putting forward for the purpose

2067
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:38,960
of uh publishing in a static

2068
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:40,960
reference to i mean i think i don't

2069
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,760
think that there is any

2070
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,880
i mean there are some open points that

2071
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,239
for example

2072
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,760
i know that for example lorenzon i would

2073
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:52,000
like to have some

2074
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,360
more control of how to disconnect the

2075
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,719
session that not just

2076
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:59,199
to rely on on the delays and ice because

2077
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,280
it could be

2078
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:03,678
on the worst case it will just you will

2079
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:07,679
have to wait for the ice disconnection

2080
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:10,880
for the and if in case of hybrid

2081
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:14,080
disconnection only if the dhls terminal

2082
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,400
is down is lost uh this is one

2083
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,280
point still to be discussed and also i

2084
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,920
know that team

2085
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,120
want to to discuss some other analysis

2086
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,440
to be removed

2087
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,679
but a part of that i don't expect to to

2088
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:27,919
to have much more work

2089
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,679
and than what it is already in the

2090
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:35,360
current spec

2091
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:37,040
i appreciate that ted you're next

2092
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,400
ted hardy speaking after he hits the

2093
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,040
allow button again

2094
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,320
um uh thanks uh i just wanted to to go

2095
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,000
back to the requirements slide for a

2096
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,559
moment uh when i look at the requirement

2097
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,960
side

2098
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,600
you have two things on here which may

2099
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,440
make me

2100
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,360
feel like maybe this actually does need

2101
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,400
a working group to to think about and

2102
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,759
that's

2103
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:57,599
um when you have under the second bullet

2104
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,880
server is assumed not to be behind

2105
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,480
a net and also supports load balancing

2106
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:05,920
and redirections

2107
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:07,599
my my sense of this could actually

2108
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,520
get a little bit more complicated than

2109
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,440
you think if you think both of those are

2110
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,960
always going to be true in these

2111
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:14,879
situations

2112
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,000
if if you have a subset of these

2113
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,679
requirements where you know

2114
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,040
it's always true then i think the right

2115
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:21,440
thing to do

2116
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,719
is to take it to the ise have it

2117
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:24,400
published as a

2118
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:26,800
this is how we are doing things for the

2119
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,400
information of the community and stop

2120
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,159
if you actually want a signaling

2121
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:31,360
protocol that's going to be able to

2122
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,960
handle

2123
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,320
the load balancing and redirection

2124
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,760
problem especially if you're going to

2125
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,120
redirect across say

2126
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:42,639
address families you have more stuff

2127
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,880
going on here than i think you nest

2128
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:46,000
you then you could certainly handle an

2129
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,000
ad sponsor i think

2130
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,440
if that's something you do want to kind

2131
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,040
of hash out then you need

2132
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,040
an actual working group to work through

2133
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,480
this um and i have no objection to a

2134
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:57,600
working group to work through this

2135
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:00,159
but i think unless you're going to to to

2136
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,639
take out some of that complexity

2137
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,440
um by by removing some of these

2138
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:06,400
requirements

2139
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:07,360
you probably can't go the ad sponsor

2140
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,360
group so i would

2141
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:11,120
i would say from the dispatch questions

2142
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:13,199
point of view

2143
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,880
my answer is if if you really think this

2144
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,320
is done go to the ise

2145
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,159
if you don't and you really want to

2146
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,360
handle this set of requirements you need

2147
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:21,599
a working group

2148
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,759
thanks yeah but first what i mean

2149
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,480
support load balancing is

2150
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,120
uh it is just relying on the the load

2151
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:31,678
balancing

2152
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:34,400
and radiation that http already supports

2153
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,040
so i'm not talking about the load

2154
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,679
balancing

2155
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,080
about the media it's just about the the

2156
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,840
load balances of the http

2157
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:46,480
supporters for example you will be able

2158
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:49,280
to to do an entity lcd post to

2159
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:51,678
a factory and that that sends an already

2160
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,639
relation to to that pal media server

2161
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,840
so it is not anything more complex than

2162
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,679
that

2163
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,120
so sergio these might this might be

2164
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,239
related to the heart of what i was

2165
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:06,000
sort of asking for before ted

2166
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:07,919
took his churn um if this is a situation

2167
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
where we're really not going to give the

2168
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:10,880
iatf change control over the document

2169
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,080
and it's a

2170
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,480
static done thing then you know the ise

2171
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,080
is the the common recommendation in

2172
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,120
those circumstances

2173
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:22,480
um but it it sounds like we start to go

2174
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,519
down that road and then we talk about

2175
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,080
like a number of

2176
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,199
fairly tricky things that actually um

2177
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,040
probably require

2178
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:30,879
a bunch of different viewpoints and you

2179
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,480
know are more suitable really for a

2180
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:35,760
for a mini working group if you will

2181
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,599
instead of um even for ad sponsored so

2182
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,360
those two things are actually fairly far

2183
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,120
apart from each other on the spectrum

2184
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:44,639
and so like some clarity on that might

2185
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:48,639
help us get us to a a recommendation

2186
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:50,719
while yeah ponder that mo you're up

2187
01:26:48,639 --> 01:26:52,400
yeah so on the surface uh it seems like

2188
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,800
a good idea if i understand right

2189
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,679
you want to have simple devices be able

2190
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,040
to

2191
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:01,360
uh have have a way to push things up

2192
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,280
even when they can't run the full-blown

2193
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,400
uh full-blown browser with arbitrary

2194
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,639
javascript

2195
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,199
and you want servers you want services

2196
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,080
to always expose some common ingestion

2197
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:12,559
point

2198
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,679
um but the thing that i question is why

2199
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,639
do you think this has anything

2200
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:18,000
with ingestion but you know seemingly a

2201
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,280
much much much bigger

2202
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,560
uh demand would be for receiving webrtc

2203
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:25,040
real-time streaming

2204
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,400
and that hasn't happened people service

2205
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,159
providers are not

2206
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:30,320
letting you know arbitrary devices hit a

2207
01:27:28,159 --> 01:27:33,280
simple url you have to have a

2208
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,080
you know an app based integration just

2209
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,199
to receive

2210
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:37,679
streaming from those services um so it's

2211
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:41,199
i

2212
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:43,840
question whether or not um you know

2213
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:44,879
why haven't smart displays been able to

2214
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,560
simply put

2215
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,960
a uri of whatever streaming service you

2216
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,800
want um and and run and go with that

2217
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:53,199
instead of doing the full integration

2218
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,040
with the specific service

2219
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:57,360
i think the same kinds of problems may

2220
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,280
hit this if you think that all services

2221
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:02,239
just have an easy ingestion point that's

2222
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:04,080
interoperable without any work on the

2223
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:06,000
device or app developer

2224
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:07,120
i'm skeptical that we'll specify

2225
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,400
anything well enough to

2226
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,559
actually make that work the uh

2227
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,320
i completely agree that it is also that

2228
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,560
something that i am working on

2229
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,080
but i think that there are different

2230
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:21,280
issues and then

2231
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:25,199
the the target is different i mean

2232
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:26,080
for for in for the ingestion and the

2233
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:28,320
stream

2234
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:30,159
implement that are related to two

2235
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,000
different people i mean for example

2236
01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:33,599
to be to talk about ingest i have to

2237
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,560
talk with encoder people

2238
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:38,400
and to talk about the view and the debut

2239
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,320
website i have to talk about

2240
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,000
mainly for example web browsers to be

2241
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:45,120
able to support

2242
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,239
an sap with something url

2243
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:51,040
in the video src and

2244
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:52,638
to be able to set up a view only the

2245
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,800
stream so

2246
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:57,120
well the solution may be similar i

2247
01:28:54,800 --> 01:29:01,280
prefer to to to handle them

2248
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:03,360
independently and but i i think that it

2249
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:07,120
is something that it is also needed

2250
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:11,120
but if yes i don't want to

2251
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:13,440
the solution may be similar but the the

2252
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:17,360
use cases is different so i would prefer

2253
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:17,360
to have it in in different places

2254
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:29,600
great thank you for that um

2255
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:31,280
okay i'm reading the uh the chat and the

2256
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,600
chair chat over on the side trying to

2257
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:35,920
decide what we've heard here

2258
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,920
um

2259
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:43,040
i think there's

2260
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:44,638
still a little bit of confusion here but

2261
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,199
people are leaning towards

2262
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:48,639
um trying to discuss on lists and build

2263
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:51,040
what a charter for a

2264
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:52,800
small mini working group might look like

2265
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,239
to try and give clarity to the work that

2266
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,520
would actually be done

2267
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:59,519
on under iatf change control

2268
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,880
and of course we can dispatch things

2269
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,719
directly from the list

2270
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,560
um should that look like you know

2271
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,639
suitable work

2272
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,480
that the ietf wants to take on and the

2273
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:10,639
vads want to charter

2274
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:12,239
um but i think that's probably the next

2275
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:12,960
step this has been i think a very useful

2276
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:16,239
discussion

2277
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,080
i'm glad we've got we've had it um but i

2278
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:19,759
i think that probably needs to be done

2279
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,719
to to crystallize what we're

2280
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:24,480
asking um we got probably like three

2281
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:26,960
more minutes we can spend on

2282
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:28,239
commentary if folks want to react to

2283
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,600
that you know next step

2284
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:35,839
plan including sergio

2285
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,840
most importantly

2286
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:45,120
mo you still queue on purpose

2287
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,599
okay sergio would that work for you we

2288
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,920
could try and uh

2289
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,960
build a charter a proposed charter and

2290
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,920
that might clarify

2291
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,840
our our thinking uh whether that's right

2292
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,040
or not

2293
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,320
yep okay

2294
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,040
we'll wrap up this and move on to the

2295
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:16,239
next topic thank you everyone for your

2296
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:19,920
your time thank you

2297
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:19,919
think this is where i need to

2298
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:27,280
do my little zip and non-linear zipping

2299
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:27,280
around in the slides

2300
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:35,040
we'd like to take a uh a moment in um

2301
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,560
each art area meeting um as we're now in

2302
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,920
the art area section of our

2303
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,239
agenda uh to mention um

2304
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:44,960
some new working groups and when they

2305
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:47,040
when they next meet um we have email

2306
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:48,320
core and asdf which have been chartered

2307
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:49,120
since the last time we met i believe

2308
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,000
http

2309
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,719
api has also been chartered since last

2310
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,840
time we met

2311
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:59,920
and they meet um on friday morning

2312
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,760
um and i'll highlight the other

2313
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:03,440
interesting meetings located down here

2314
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,159
and then if anyone would like to

2315
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:07,678
step up and offer a 30 second you should

2316
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,799
really come to this meeting

2317
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:12,080
uh testimonial uh for any of these or

2318
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,840
something else you think would be of

2319
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,199
interest to this working group i would

2320
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,360
encourage you to do so

2321

01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:30,799
um am i making sounds this time

2347
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,840
yes excellent um

2348
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:34,400
just uh ten seconds jen dispatch the

2349
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,600
only

2350
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:41,199
item on our agenda is an update

2351
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:45,040
to uh it's 7

2352
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:48,400
2 2 1 which is the rfc about how

2353
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:49,280
working groups may wish to adopt

2354
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:52,400
documents or

2355
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,840
unadopt documents so not

2356
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:55,280
terribly exciting stuff but you're all

2357
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:57,520
welcome to come and chat about that if

2358

last presentation

2364
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:23,199
of the day floor is yours

2365
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:27,360
hello can you hear me yes

2366
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:28,879
sounds good um yeah i this is the most

2367
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,040
obviously the most uh interesting

2368
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,679
presentation today so i'll try to be

2369
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,719
quick

2370
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:37,679
um so bernie and i uh are working

2371
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:37,679
on um

2372
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:45,199
mdkg in uh lamps on header protection

2373
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:46,879
for smile and pgp and this is sort of

2374
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:50,719
came out of

2375
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:53,520
this um whether a signal

2376
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:55,040
saying that a particular message is

2377
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,560
being encapsulated

2378
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,880
um is useful and we want to talk about

2379
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,760
whether it's used for another context

2380
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,760
next slide please

2381
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,760
right so um yeah that's that's that's

2382
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,360
good

2383
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,360
um basically um

2384
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:29,760
when protecting headers um

2385
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:33,199
we need to make a copy of um

2386
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,199
the header fields um

2387
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:38,960
within signature or in encrypted block

2388
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:39,919
um so they basically sort of need to be

2389
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:44,960
duplicated

2390
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:47,920
um and the way this is described in

2391
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:50,239
s prime is just says to wrap it in

2392
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,360
message rfc822

2393
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:54,718
which is unfortunately ambiguous

2394
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:56,719
because it's unclear whether it's

2395
01:35:54,719 --> 01:36:01,119
afforded message or whether it's

2396
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:04,639
a mechanism for encapsulating headers

2397
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:04,639
and the message next slide

2398
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:11,280
so this is expanded example how this

2399
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:14,639
might look like

2400
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:17,599
so there is a outer unprotected header

2401
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,600
a little wrapper

2402
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:24,560
and then the copy of it in a header and

2403
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,400
the message itself on

2404
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,400
the signature next slide

2405
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:37,440
so um the draft at the moment says

2406
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:38,799
that in order to distinguish from

2407
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:41,678
forwarded message

2408
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,600
uh there is an extra parameter on the

2409
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:47,760
content type

2410
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:49,360
which is forwarded like yes or no um

2411
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,040
there was some discussion on the mailing

2412
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:54,639
list martin's suggestion

2413
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:57,519
suggested that maybe content disposition

2414
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:59,760
is actually a good fit for this

2415
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,880
for example content disposition online

2416
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:05,119
uh

2417
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:08,159
maybe a new content disposition type

2418
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:12,000
like encapsulated to make it specific

2419
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:13,440
for this purpose um and there was also a

2420
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,400
suggestion to maybe

2421
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:21,839
uh have a new content content semantics

2422
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,839
had a feel to to signal that

2423
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:29,440
the first two um

2424
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,080
proposals have advantage that they sort

2425
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,678
of work

2426
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:35,600
very well with imap because

2427
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:37,679
all parameters to content type and

2428
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,520
content disposition are returned

2429
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,960
within the protocol the last one doesn't

2430
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:48,320
work as well

2431
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:51,040
but happy to hear opinions on this

2432
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,040
next slide

2433
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,080
so uh question for this group is are

2434
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,440
there

2435
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:02,239
are any other

2436
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,638
use cases other than so basically is

2437
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:05,919
this

2438
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:09,440
uh very s mine pgp specific

2439
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:12,719
or are are there other ways

2440
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:14,839
that this can be used and

2441
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,119
um what's the best mechanism for doing

2442
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:20,320
this

2443
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:31,839
i think what's the next slide

2444
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:31,840
yeah questions

2445
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:45,839
uh please john levine

2446
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,440
no audio john

2447
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:59,839
we can see you

2448
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:04,400
still not

2449
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,880
cannot hear you why don't we give braun

2450
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,840
a chance and we'll come right back to

2451
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,840
you john next

2452
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,000
by approval of things uh content

2453
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,360
disposition feels like the right thing

2454
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
to me it feels like that's exactly what

2455
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:29,119
this is is

2456
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,000
a disposition for the message rather

2457
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:34,159
than the content type of the message

2458
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:40,560
but other than that it seems like

2459
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:43,040
something that could be generally useful

2460
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:43,040
thank you

2461
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:48,320
why don't we do uh daniel next then

2462
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,840
we'll

2463
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,080
give john another chance john are you

2464
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,080
ready

2465
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,400
still no audio

2466
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:03,678
all right dkg hi folks

2467
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:06,719
um this is dkg i'm with aclu

2468
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,679
um so i've been trying to figure out how

2469
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,719
to use

2470
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:12,159
this uh forwarded equals no or

2471
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,440
kind of distribution or anything like

2472
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:18,879
this in terms of header protection

2473
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:22,559
and the the difficulty is that

2474
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:24,639
we can't we can't tell

2475
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,320
old clients that don't know about it to

2476
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:29,360
respect it this way

2477
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:30,559
um right but sort of by definition that

2478
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,000
the already deployed clients are

2479
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,560
behaving differently

2480
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,040
um so i'm fine with making an indication

2481
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,960
that

2482
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:38,239
you know yes this is exactly how i meant

2483
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,840
it and it wasn't supposed to be a

2484
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,280
message that was an attached message or

2485
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,000
a forwarded message

2486
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:45,679
um but there's still going to be a

2487
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,159
challenge when dealing with

2488
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:49,280
the large number of legacy clients that

2489
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:51,839
are out there

2490
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:54,239
um so in terms of uh i mean we'll be

2491
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:57,440
discussing how to protection

2492
01:40:54,239 --> 01:41:00,159
in lamps i think tomorrow um

2493
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:01,040
i think that there are other options for

2494
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:04,719
how to do

2495
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,080
uh header protection um

2496
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:08,560
including stuff that's actually been

2497
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:09,760
deployed i mean enigma has been doing

2498
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,639
and several others have been doing

2499
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,440
header protection uh in a different way

2500
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,320
um that has some level of backward

2501
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:18,638
compatibility

2502
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:20,719
uh that you makes things work with with

2503
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,840
um

2504
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:25,360
with existing clients so you know i'm

2505
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,400
fine with any of these ways of doing it

2506
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:28,559
but i think it doesn't

2507
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,440
fundamentally solve the problem of

2508
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,639
dealing with

2509
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:33,759
uh of interacting with the legacy client

2510
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:34,560
and we don't know when you're sending

2511
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,840
the message

2512
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,440
whether you are interacting with a

2513
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,960
legacy client or not so i just think

2514
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:40,400
this is a very challenging

2515
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:41,679
space to work in and i'm not sure that

2516
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,320
this is the right spot to do the

2517
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:47,840
signaling

2518
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:47,840
but any of the proposals seem fine to me

2519
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:54,080
[Music]

2520
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:56,320
it says i have audio now now can you

2521
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:59,600
hear me yes

2522
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:02,559
oh good um the other another use case is

2523
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:04,560
mailing lists and dmarc everybody's

2524
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:08,480
favorite mailing list thing

2525
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:10,719
um back when we were trying to fix the

2526
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:11,839
itf list to work around dmarc one of the

2527
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,880
things i tried

2528
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,239
was um wrapping single messages very

2529
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:18,239
very much the same way this

2530
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:20,239
this thing does it so there's an outside

2531
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:22,239
header that passes dmarc and the inside

2532
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:24,159
header actually describes the message

2533
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:25,919
um that's basically it's basically the

2534
01:42:24,159 --> 01:42:30,320
same scenario

2535
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:32,480
my question is why adding

2536
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,519
it seems to me this like this is the the

2537
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,199
message the

2538
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,880
the mime type here would be like message

2539
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:38,638
encapsulated rather than adding a flag

2540
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:43,360
to message rs8

2541
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:44,000
rfc a3822 and i agree with dkg that the

2542
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:46,880
current

2543
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,560
behavior of muas with any sort of

2544
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,520
attached or wrapped messages is pretty

2545
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,560
poor

2546
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:55,119
so on the one hand i mean i

2547
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,119
imagine partly it's like well message

2548
01:42:55,119 --> 01:42:59,440
encapsulated is likely to work worse

2549
01:42:57,119 --> 01:43:00,639
than message yeah message global but

2550
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:03,040
message global already works pretty

2551
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:03,040
badly

2552
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,080
this is not a hell i'm this is not a

2553
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:15,040
hill i'm planning to die on it's just

2554
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,040
it's mostly a question

2555
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:21,280
okay thank you good good question i i

2556
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:26,559
tend to agree with you

2557
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:26,559
that um it's tricky

2558
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:39,440
harold you're up next yeah i feel like

2559
01:43:37,360 --> 01:43:41,599
old man yelling at cloud or something

2560
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:46,000
but

2561
01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:49,520
multi-part signed was never ever ever

2562
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
or a message signed was never ever ever

2563
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,760
ever

2564
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:56,960
ever intended for forwarding

2565
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:58,960
so the fact is the muas that this

2566
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,080
display this as a forwarded message

2567
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,360
are begging so we can either yell at

2568
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,280
them to fix the bug

2569
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:07,040
or we can add more markers that mean

2570
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:11,840
exactly the same thing

2571
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:11,840
and then tell them to fix the bug so

2572
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:18,159
i don't think this this is solvable by

2573
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,600
by by adding more markers that mean the

2574
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,638
same thing as what we intended in the

2575
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,880
first place

2576
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:24,880
can we just get the bug fixed

2577
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:34,080
philip as of now you get the last word

2578
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:38,000
we'll

2579
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:40,480
see if anyone gets in behind you uh

2580
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,520
i i support doing something on this i

2581
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,440
mean

2582
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,440
i i think everybody in the queue and

2583
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,759
ever you know i think everybody's played

2584
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:48,239
with

2585
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,520
s mime has proposed something of the

2586
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:52,080
sort

2587
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,639
over you know the past 25 years and

2588
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,840
there's

2589
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,239
always been the problem of the legacy s

2590
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:59,280
mime

2591
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:01,519
clients don't do what they should or

2592
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:03,759
what we would want them to

2593
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,199
i think there's another piece that comes

2594
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,520
up and that is

2595
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:10,638
when we talk about headers there's

2596
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:13,280
really two types of message headers

2597
01:45:10,639 --> 01:45:14,480
there's content headers you know there

2598
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,159
are headers that really should have

2599
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:19,129
always been part of the content

2600
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:20,320
and there are routing headers and

2601
01:45:19,130 --> 01:45:23,679
[Music]

2602
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:26,239
smtp just smushed the two together

2603
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:28,880
and so maybe what we need to do is to

2604
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:32,080
disentangle those two

2605
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:35,440
and say which are the two things

2606
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:41,519
and which are different before we try

2607
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:44,799
and you know and uh fix rfc8281

2608
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:48,000
before trying to layer more stuff on top

2609
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:50,239
um because you know as i said

2610
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:59,600
we've tried this before and it didn't

2611
01:45:50,239 --> 01:46:02,080
get very far

2612
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,080
thank you

2613
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:08,400
any wrap up thoughts alexi

2614
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,280
i have lots of good comments sorry i i'm

2615
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:19,520
sort of still waking up in

2616
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:22,960
my time zone so um yeah i'll uh

2617
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:22,960
i'll review the comments and

2618
01:46:23,119 --> 01:46:25,759
we'll continue you know if you're

2619
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,920
interested in the header protection

2620
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,719
topic specifically please come to lamps

2621
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,719
which is tomorrow

2622
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:41,839
awesome thank you thank you

2623
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,239
um so the that completes uh our

2624
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,119
structured agenda we do have

2625
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:50,559
um 10 minutes available if there's any

2626
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:52,639
other business that's available to the

2627
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:54,400
art area

2628
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:56,480
anyone would like to step forward with

2629
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:59,440
otherwise

2630
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,440
we can conclude

2631
01:47:01,119 --> 01:47:03,440
braun

2632
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,559
didn't um didn't get ready in time for

2633
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,879
this meeting but

2634
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,199
the there was discussion that i emailed

2635
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:18,840
the list a few weeks ago about

2636
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:20,559
a time format basically updating rfc

2637
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,239
3339

2638
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,679
so since we have this time and no one

2639
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:25,199
else seems to want to discuss anything

2640
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,639
does anyone want to

2641
01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:30,239
to talk about where they think that

2642
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:30,239
might be best put

2643
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:35,840
so the the concept is to add

2644
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:38,159
basically sigils afterwards that include

2645
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,320
both the time zone that a time is in

2646
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,759
um and also the calendar format it's in

2647
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:45,199
if it's not gregorian

2648
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:46,719
so that there are other this people seem

2649
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:48,719
to be moving towards the idea of

2650
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:50,800
having a gregorian time stamp always but

2651
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:52,480
then saying it transpose this into this

2652
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,159
calendar system to process it

2653
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,678
and keeping that sigil with the time

2654
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:58,960
because that's the safest

2655
01:47:55,679 --> 01:48:02,159
for round tripping things and this

2656
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:04,960
this work is coming out of the

2657
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:07,280
javascript working groups amongst other

2658
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:07,280
things

2659
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:22,480
i'll jump right in here and didn't we

2660
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:26,159
try to address this in calder calyx

2661
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:30,400
cal something about

2662
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:33,360
somewhere in the in the late 90s

2663
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:33,920
we've done uh recurrence rules and r

2664
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,239
scale

2665
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,119
which is to say that this recurrence

2666
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,959
rule applies

2667
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:40,239
in a a different time system than

2668
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:42,480
gregorian

2669
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:43,599
but what hasn't been addressed is the

2670
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:47,440
format so

2671
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:48,080
the the iso 8601 whatever it is sorry

2672
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:51,519
not that one

2673
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:53,119
um yeah time time for rfc three three

2674
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:56,400
three nine time format year

2675
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:59,440
year dash month month day day and then

2676
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:00,320
t and some minutes and seconds but what

2677
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:02,320
we don't have

2678
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,519
is the ability to say what time zone

2679
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,239
that's in

2680
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:06,880
in that string and so it's stringifying

2681
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:10,080
a time

2682
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:12,080
with a time zone and a calendar system

2683
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,519
and it's working out exactly what format

2684
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:17,199
we want that to be in

2685
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,800
so they have just to bring this to itf

2686
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:22,080
so all the proposals for doing that

2687
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,080
failed the last time

2688
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:29,839
yeah well it was a stupid idea to leave

2689
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:29,840
out

2690
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:38,159
thanks braun thanks harold uh

2691
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,159
neil got time for one more i think here

2692
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:45,440
just going to yeah clarify on this yes

2693
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:48,159
the tc39 group

2694
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:48,719
um developing ecmascript javascript that

2695
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:50,799
are

2696
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:52,639
currently looking uh for this i think we

2697
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:56,800
do need a serialization format

2698
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:58,719
um for uh dates with time zones

2699
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,480
lots of people do this and if we don't

2700
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,840
define something then we'll have lots of

2701
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:03,839
different compatible versions out there

2702
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:11,840
it seems an obvious extension to

2703
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:11,840
3539 to me

2704
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,559
so braun if people want to explore this

2705
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:20,799
further what list do you think i mean do

2706
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:22,159
you think this is dispatch or

2707
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:24,080
it's probably just i think probably

2708
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,519
calcify is is the

2709
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:26,719
sensible place to discuss that given

2710
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,520
that all the other calendaring works

2711
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:30,400
there

2712
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,840
yeah okay so if you're interested in

2713
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:34,480
continuing this discussion

2714
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:38,639
uh calcified sounds great yeah the other

2715
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:40,239
other possible places tz data

2716
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:42,000
i'm subscribed to both so i'm sure i'll

2717
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:45,199
see whatever you say

2718
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,599
thanks thanks for raising it

2719
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:49,199
hey ben given that we're wrapping the

2720
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,520
meeting up and this is your last meeting

2721
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,440

2722
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:53,679
chair would you turn your video on so

2724
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:58,400
so i can i can wave goodbye to you i

2725
01:50:56,159 --> 01:51:00,559
just i want to tell people like how hard

2726
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,679
uh ben has worked at this job i mean i

2727
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:05,040
think

2728
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,080
the most important part of the dispatch

2729
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:07,840
chair job is actually

2730
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:09,760
reaching out and integrating folks who

2731
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:13,119
just have no idea how this

2732
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:16,560
idf process works and then

2733
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:18,480
it's just an exemplary

2734
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:19,920
instance of of making that work as a

2735
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:20,718
chair and so i've learned quite a bit

2736
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,040
from him and i

2737
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,080
i really appreciate it so we'll be sad

2738
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:27,199
to see you go

2739
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,080
but um you know the the istar is always

2740
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:32,159
happy to have you

2741
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:35,840
so thanks ben and thank you everyone for

2742
