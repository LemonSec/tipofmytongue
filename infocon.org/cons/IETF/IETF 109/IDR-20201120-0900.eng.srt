oh look it's the top of the hour

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,200

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
sound

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,199
i believed it what a fool okay

9
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,000
thank you for the axe um here we are

10
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,760
it's idr you knew that because it's kind

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,079
of hard to wander into the wrong virtual

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,079
realm

13
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
here's our note well if you're in this

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,479
meeting

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,760
you're somehow agreed to this thing

16
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,799
because it was on some click wrap and

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,439
you've uh are

18
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
are presumed to have read and agreed to

19
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,080
all this stuff

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
if you haven't go read it

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,400
we have an agenda um

22
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,600
we had let's see actually this

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,000
is a little outdated because

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,960
both of linda's talks number six is

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,040
coming after number seven

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,559
um other than that i think the agenda is

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
as it as it said before

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
so uh sue do you want to talk to this

29
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,079
can you hear me

30
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:05,600
good so i set working group status out

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,160
today um i don't

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,440
i am looking for bgp ls reviewers

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,799
if you have expertise in

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,640
implementation or

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,160
deployment please let me know i would

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,480
like we have four

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,040
bgpls documents which have just been

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,040
approved

39
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,879

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
adoption requests if you've got an

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,760
adoption request please send me a note

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,160
and a yang model uh has received

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,840
shares uh comments from the young

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,239
doctors i'd love to know if

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,000
uh if there's any comments i still have

48
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,680
a couple people to

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
check with i will try to arrange some

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,280
conversations with you

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,920
one-on-one and then perhaps you may see

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
a

53
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,159
short uh g i'd like to collect

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
comments on the pgp gang model so we can

55
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
wrap that one up

56
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
next john

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:22,879
find it

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,560
okay where are we well flow spec

59
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,239
uh 5575 fists and flow spec b6 are very

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,319
close to publication

61
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,560
we're crying we're nitpicking with some

62
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,280
of the isg members

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,400
but that's good we wanted to make sure

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,440
this time

65
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,720
we don't have to go back and do the uh

66
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
the version ones

67
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
it's time to begin work for people who

68
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,680
are interested in flow spec

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,319
version 2 uh watch for a call for

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,560
presentations and perhaps an interim

71
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,760
i'd like to kick things off on interims

72
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,120
because this is a

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
short time sign the ipsec tunnels are

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,640
still progressing along

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,040
i'll go through that and bgpls

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,798
will talk about streamlining the auto

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,519
comp work is started

78
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,040
uh the chairs will restart and i think

79
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,799
we're

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,159
pretty much got one route league

81
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,160
protection document

82
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,600
and girl and idr are

83
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
working together next slide

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,479
the ipsec tunnels this is just a report

85
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,520
from someone who

86
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
has been trying to

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,880
work with all three uh sets of authors

88
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,840
we had two an idr one and best i still

89
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,560
see three different use cases for these

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,159
my goal

91
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
has gone down has

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,720
as a sort of shepherd trying to help

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
them is to see if we can share tlbs if

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
they're this

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
subtleties if they're the same

96
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
information but the critical thing is

97
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
that they get reviewed by the security

98
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
area

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
and or security directed so that when we

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
come back to the isg with them

101
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
we're not uh spending time iterating

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,560
there

103
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,039
they also be based on draft itf id or

104
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,560
tunnel

105
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,280
and caps and i look for clear

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080
uh specification a non goal to force

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,799
these three

108
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,440
different use cases into one tunnel type

109
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,800
next side john

110
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,759
ah and now adrian uh brought us the

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,080
bgpls registries adrian would you please

112
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
uh

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:40,639
lead this discussion yeah sure um

114
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,599
so uh you may remember we had a a little

115
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,199
draft

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,600
to uh fix up um the bgpls

117
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
registry uh allocation policy so this

118
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
was all set up originally

119
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,039
in 7752 as

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
um

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,318
that's interesting that's wrong so they

122
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,280
were all all

123
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,080
set up as specification required with a

124
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,520
approval by a designated expert

125
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,359
and the guidance to the de um they're

126
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,919
asked for a stable document

127
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,319
as described in rfc 5226 which is now

128
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
eight

129
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,800
one um eight one seven

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,599
four i can't remember um

131
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,759
so there's lots of debate about um

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,319
whether an internet draft qualifies

133
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
as a stable document

134
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,160
and alvaro pointed out that

135
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,759
idr's not the place to have

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,919
this sort of debate so

137
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:55,440
we really have uh two options

138
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,560
um uh moved uh

139
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,479
to expert review expert review simply

140
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,199
relies on the designated experts

141
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
which is what we had done in uh in the

142
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
draft in

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
question or we could move back to

144
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,360
specification required

145
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,800
but tighten the the guidance

146
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,560
so i uh kicked the list uh and very many

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,400
thanks to bruno les

148
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,960
uh ac and kittan for um

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
for for chiming in and it looks like

150
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,719
we're

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,360
moving very fast to yes let's be expert

152
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,639
review

153
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,560
but let's tighten up what the d is

154
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,759
allowed to do

155
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,240
in line with rsc 7370 which did

156
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,960
something

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,879
similar for an isis registry um

158
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,280
so uh i think that my next actions are

159
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,120
to

160
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,159
bash the uh the de guidance

161
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,360
and then ask the chairs um

162
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,680
whether we should wait for 7752 bis

163
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,800
which is on our agenda later

164
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,919
uh or push it push this draft back to

165
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,840
the

166
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,840
ad for further action

167
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,080
to ask that now or do you want to ask

168
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,520
that after you've bashed your document

169
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
um i think the two things are entirely

170
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
independent

171
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,319
that is to say that the text needs

172
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
bashing full stop

173
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,120
and we should now decide given that uh

174
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,279
7752 this may have advanced uh

175
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,959
a lot closer we should we should decide

176
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:48,959
whether we want one or two documents

177
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:52,560
um i uh being at the speed at which

178
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,199
uh things come in and off of the

179
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
uh adq i'd like to keep what's on the

180
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
queue

181
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,279
on the queue uh then the a.d can bash

182
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
but that's

183
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:07,600
that's my single co-chair

184
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:10,080
um very um tactile viewpoint

185
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
john or uh working group any other

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,480
thoughts

187
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,480
you have alvaro in your queue

188
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,000
viral speak john i think you have to

189
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,000
allow alvaro

190
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,959
okay so is it me or john me okay

191
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,720
um yes i'm sorry my q is kind of slow

192
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,439
but you know there's a lot of documents

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,800
uh tunneling caps took a long time um

194
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,320
yeah whatever i have a lot of

195
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,000
excuses um what i want to say is that

196
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,680
i'm not opposed to two documents or

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,399
whatever you guys want

198
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:55,040
what i did want to point out is that um

199
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:58,880
7370 which adrian mentioned

200
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,880
is the guidance for actual review for

201
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,320
the isis registries

202
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,160
and basically what that says is that

203
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,079
um it is basically

204
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,399
7120 but handled by the expert review

205
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,199
handled by the experts in other words

206
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
drafts

207
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
need to basically be adopted by the

208
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,399
working group before anything gets

209
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
adopted

210
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,519
so it is pretty much the same thing you

211
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,880
have today

212
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
except that

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,279
it's a different way right it says 73 10

214
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,519
or 73

215
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
70 with extra review instead of

216
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
specification required

217
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,959
with 7120. uh with that little caveat

218
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
of maybe there's no not enough clarity

219
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,719
uh

220
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
different places about whether an idea

221
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
is accepted or not that is

222
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,800
totally up to the these and i know that

223
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
it's not that's not documented anywhere

224
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,319
but you know i'm sure that the current

225
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
des which adrian is one

226
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,240
and the chairs and me and ayanna

227
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,959
wouldn't be opposed to any of that

228
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,440
um so having said that um if we're gonna

229
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,959
go with seven three

230
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,240
seventy like um

231
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,760
uh expert uh instructions it is pretty

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,440
much the same thing that you have today

233
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,959
if one of the objectives which is what i

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,200
understood from the draft

235
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,359
was to speed things up and let people

236
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,959
request code points

237
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,800
without being working group documents

238
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
then that doesn't necessarily get you

239
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,599
there

240
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,560
now again assuming that 737 is taken the

241
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,440
way it is

242
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:43,839
it can still be modified so i just want

243
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:43,839
to point that out

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,880
did you have any other comments i think

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,920
um alvaro i wasn't trying to say that

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,880
things were really slow but i agree that

247
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,719
tunnel

248
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,760
end caps took a lot of time out of both

249
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,120
alvaro john and i

250
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
it's a good and meaty speck i'm amazed

251
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,880
with

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,360
uh some stuff john's done okay

253
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
adrian any more final comments otherwise

254
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
i'll go on to some more chair

255
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,360
no let's let's let's get the working

256
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,560
group going and i'll take this to the

257
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,079
list

258
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:33,040
okay so i'm gonna go down to the next

259
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,040
slide could you advance for me

260
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,839

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,639

go

326
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,160
to all the details so uh this was

327
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,199
presented uh

328
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,519
a year ago now uh and we have had uh

329
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,560
you know feedback and inputs uh a lot of

330
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,279
discussions on their

331
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,758
list as well uh and all of those have

332

340
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,839
next slide

341
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,640
uh so what are the updates over the past

342
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,919
year uh that is since the last

343
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,799
presentation

344
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,280
uh there have been changes to align with

345
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
the

346
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,559
sr policy architecture the base draft

347
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
there was some confusion about

348
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
the policy name tlv that was there

349
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,839
existing

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
and you know that was actually the sr

351
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,280
policy candidate path

352
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
but then based on requirements and

353
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,000
requests we

354
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,440
also added the policy name uh

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,520
again for alignment with sr policy draft

356
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,520
uh discussion about the route origin

357
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,240
community and its usage

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
to indicate the originator so we've

359
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,320
added

360
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,080
that in the draft and then uh

361
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,639
we'll go about the changes related to

362
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,320
srv6 uh in the next slide

363
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,480
uh but other thing i would like to flag

364
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,280
quickly is we've seen the tunnel encaps

365
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,720
draft

366
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,160
you know getting fixed up and as part of

367
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,799
that the ayana

368
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
registration uh is happening there for

369
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
the

370
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
color extended community so this draft

371
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,559
has now been updated to

372
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,480
refer there and you know diana section

373
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,600
text has been updated uh there are other

374
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,799
fixes and stuff again thanks

375
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:28,719
to everybody for pointing it out

376
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,760
next slide please

377
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,640
so about the srv6 uh the network

378
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
programming

379
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,120
is you know with the isd awaiting uh you

380
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,600
know last uh discuss

381
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,039
but uh what we did over the past year is

382
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,639
uh you know updated to

383
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,760
line uh so we have a srv6 binding set

384
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,440
tlv

385
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,919
and this is because the current binding

386
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,840
ctl we you know only we could have only

387
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,880
one binding set associated with sr

388
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
policy

389
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,480
but when we get to srv6 we can have

390
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,918
you know more than one with possibly

391
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,840
different behaviors

392
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,360
so all that clarification and text has

393
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,639
been added

394
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,639
and the segment types

395
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,400
have been updated for the optional

396
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,760
signaling of you know algorithm

397
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,000
behavior uh things like that so

398
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,120
that segment type changes uh what it has

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,480
resulted in

400
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,320
is that the previous type tlvs

401
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,679
uh we've had to you know deprecate them

402
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,280
we had a check with

403
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
some of the vendors and you know whether

404
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,080
they are deployed and used and all

405
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,600
and we got the indication that they may

406
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,879
not be implemented or

407
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,240
deployed fully as yet but just to be

408
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
safe

409
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
the proposal is to you know deprecate

410
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
them uh

411
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,959
they are kept in the appendix so look

412
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,559
forward to feedback

413
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,480
from the working group on on this one

414
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,280
next slide please uh so

415
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,880
uh next step is uh i would say preparing

416
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,840
for the working group last call

417
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,120
uh the implementations have been updated

418
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,280
uh with two

419
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,039
but uh we're aware that there are more

420
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,399
so i would request

421
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,840
to please update and uh

422
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,919
i think it would be good if we can

423
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,080
plan a working group last call for this

424
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,120
preferably after the base

425
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,320
one is done in uh spring uh any

426
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,280
questions or

427
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,280
comments feedback

428
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,639
looks like we have a um comment from g

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
please go ahead

430
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:39,120
can you hear me yes yes hi g

431
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,400
hi uh regarding this uh change in the

432
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,760
segment types

433
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,360
uh you know there's also a

434
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,320
draft on the tlsp distribution to

435
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,158
report yes yes i think we need to

436
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,678
there's also a list of the segment types

437
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,039
maybe they need some alignment

438
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,960
or simply reference this one yeah

439
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,080
yes you are correct g i think we need to

440
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
work on that as well

441
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,158
uh we'll we'll work on that uh i mean

442
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
you are also the co-author that will

443
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,960
work on that option

444
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,959
yes yes okay thanks for bringing that up

445
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,400
okay um seeing nobody else in the queue

446
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,919
i guess we can

447
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,919
move on to our

448
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:33,280
next one

449
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,320
yeah so this is an update on the rfc

450
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,000
7752 the bgpls this

451
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,840
uh that you know adrian referred to

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,280
earlier uh

453
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,080
next slide please uh so

454
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,200
we have had uh since the rfci

455
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,720
publication and even

456
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,799
before that we have had uh you know a

457
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,799
lot of implementation and deployment now

458
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:55,600
with lot of use cases

459
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,520
and there has been a discussion uh on

460
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,719
the list as well as a lot of inputs

461
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,960
from various uh folks

462
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
including our ad when he he was

463
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,280
reviewing uh some of the segment routing

464
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,320
extensions that there are issues

465
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:13,520
so we started uh around

466
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,639
idea 104 this thing to try to fix them

467
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,440
up

468
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
uh and uh you know the draft was

469
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,360
presented at 105

470
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,120
a little over a year ago and then it was

471
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,918
adopted so it's been

472
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,959
a year now more than a year so i would

473
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,919
like to thank uh

474
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,880
everybody uh again for a lot of feedback

475
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
and input

476
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
a lot of it uh on the list but there was

477
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:41,840
also a lot of off list

478
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,840
uh comments uh next slide please

479
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
so we have tried to capture as editor

480
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,719
for the working group i've tried to

481
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,799
capture

482
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,280
everything in all those inputs and

483
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,280
comments

484
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
i didn't want to go over all of that but

485
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
uh i would like to point that the

486
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,039
appendix has list of all the changes

487
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,159
from the base

488
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,960
7752 it's like a kind of a summary

489
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,600
and then actually uh you could run a

490
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
diff

491
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,600
there's a link there to check what has

492
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,280
actually changed from the base pack as

493
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,320
well

494
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,240
i'm hoping that this helps

495
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,439
the working group actually go through

496
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,520
review and

497
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,679
make sure that everything is okay and

498
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,879
you know we are done

499
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,880
uh next slide please

500
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,679
uh so uh so ayanna register in our

501
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,000
considerations uh you know we discuss uh

502
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,919
there is a draft uh

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,200
that you know we are it's in ad

504
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,400
evaluation

505
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,600
uh whatever gets updated uh uh or

506
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,880
accepted there will

507
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,639
you know also incorporate that here uh

508
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
in in this uh in this draft

509
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,840
personally i think that it is required

510
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,080
or good to

511
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,279
progress the bgpls registry draft as a

512
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,840
point fix rfc

513
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,840
it would go through much faster

514
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,399
so that's just my preference but we'll

515
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,840
look for working group

516
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,840
uh next slide please

517
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,039
and this is uh the last one really all

518
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
uh all issues and all concerns have been

519
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,840
addressed please let know

520
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,279
if anything was missing i know it was a

521
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,480
difficult time over the

522
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,200
past nine months this year but

523
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,679
you know in case you wanted to so there

524
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,039
was

525
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,799
a bit of silence but if there is

526
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,600
anything else that needs to be added

527
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,158
please uh do let know i'll also poll the

528
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,840
list

529
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:47,679
after this meeting uh last slide i think

530
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,120
is the next one so uh

531
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,120
if i mean how do we go about this

532
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,320
and wanted to check here whether we need

533
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,439
to keep this this document open

534
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,279
if yes for how long if no then maybe

535
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,159
next year early next year we start

536
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,200
planning for a working group last call

537
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,279
because

538
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
i'm not sure if helps just to keep the

539
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,200
document open

540
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,799
look to inputs from the working group

541
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,919
chairs as well

542
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,240
john i'll jump in here real quick i

543
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,360
always find that a working group last

544
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,760
call

545
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,639
knocks out documents when knocks out

546
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,320
excuse me

547
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,919
comments to documents so i'd

548
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,840
uh go for uh december or january for

549
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,760
working group class call whenever you

550
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,639
finish the other things

551
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,760
uh john do you have any other comments

552
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,559
about that

553
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,120
i was just gonna give my answer to the

554
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,960
uh

555
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,199
do we see a need to keep the biz

556
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,520
document open for more time and

557
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,880
my answer is uh if you feel it's done

558
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,039
then um i don't see it i need to keep it

559
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,760
just arbitrarily open

560
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,279
um i you know we we need to have a

561
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,440
proper working group last call

562
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,960
and uh and know that some people have

563
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
reviewed it but

564
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,679
beyond that now let's let's get it done

565
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,039
i mean if anybody else

566
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,279
thinks otherwise please put yourself in

567
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,320
the queue but

568
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,840
um i'd say yeah what's you said let's go

569
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,600
ahead with the last call fairly

570
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:25,840
promptly and i see adrian volunteering

571
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,840
to review thank you adrian

572
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,279
yes thanks idiot

573
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,520
and unless there's anybody else who

574
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,640
wants to put themselves in the queue i

575
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,840
think we can uh

576
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,840
we can move forward

577
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,480
donald okay hi this is donald east lake

578
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
with

579
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,039
future where

580
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,719
that's what i wanted to i'm going to

581
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,360
present on uh

582
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,600
flow spec for mobile traffic next slide

583
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,600
please

584
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,559
so uh the if the file name for historic

585
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,918
reasons has nvo3 in it but it

586
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,000
it's actually designed to cover flows

587
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,279
for a wide variety of tunnel types that

588
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,400
are listed there

589
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,240
one's currently in the draft

590
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,679
will be possible to add more i suppose

591
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
but i think it's got a pretty good

592
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
covering

593
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,399
and it allows you to match on the actual

594
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
tunnel header

595
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,719
fields of various sorts uh

596
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,520
as well as the various headers that are

597
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,200
just beyond the tunnel header uh

598
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,120
typically ip headers just beyond the

599
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,960
tunnel header could be other things

600
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,678
and uh you can as well match on uh

601
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,440
the ip or whatever header in front of it

602
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,360
there'll be examples and stuff in a

603
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,760
little bit later in the presentation

604
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,559
and you indicate all this with a happy

605
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,000
safy pair

606
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,480
using a new safi that indicates it's

607
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
a flow spec for tunnel traffic and the

608
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,520
affi indicates what

609
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,520
you're going to match right at the very

610
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,639
beginning of the packet

611
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,918
or the leaning of the packet inside the

612
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,440
vpn if it's a case where you're matching

613
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
vpn traffic

614
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,600
so for example you might have a ipv4 or

615
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,960
a fee but the saffy says tunnels that

616
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,918
means you've matched

617
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,960
an initial ipv4 header but then you

618
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,840
would

619
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,279
be able to match various forms of

620
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,840
following that tunnel

621
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,320
header and if you want to go beyond that

622
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,480
and

623
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,080
match the headers just beyond the tunnel

624
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,240
header next slide

625
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,918
so this is just how this depends on

626
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,480
other drafts

627
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,399
and i annotated this with uh what i

628
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,760
believe is the current

629
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,760
status of the different slides

630
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,840
uh next slide please

631
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,320
so this has been changed the last

632
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,678
presented version was 08

633
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,520
so uh 0809 or changes in the precedence

634
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,520
rules to clarify things

635
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,600
obviously only when a tunnel source back

636
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,559
is involved existing rules uh

637
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,439
cover other cases and various editorial

638
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,158
improvements and

639
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,240
typo fixes particularly the two noted

640
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
there which occurred multiple times

641
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,840
next slide

642
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,559
and then there's changes from 09 to the

643
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,960
currently posted 10 version

644
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:26,158
uh the l2 tpv3

645
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,720
flow spec in there was extended

646
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,840
and previously it was good for data

647
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,840
messages

648
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,879
uh but it didn't really cover control

649
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,520
messages

650
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,480
so that uh involved one fairly small

651
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,960
addition

652
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,240
uh sort of expanding the capabilities

653
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
for that particular

654
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,880
tunnel type and the second point here is

655
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,039
the various fields which were

656
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,000
added for matching purposes to

657
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,760
handle control messages uh and for

658
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,320
further editorial improvements

659
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
next slide

660
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,158
so this is kind of the heart of the

661
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,159
thing uh so what the

662
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,159
nlri looks like so

663
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,480
you have the overall length and then

664
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,200
there's the tunnel type

665
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,960
so you know you if uh you have to have a

666
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
tunnel type if you're using this

667
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,799
it's only for tunnel traffic and it only

668
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,720
matches uh

669
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,879
tunnels of that type there are two flags

670
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
uh one indicates whether or not there's

671
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,039
a routing distinguisher present because

672
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,080
you

673
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,200
want to handle a vpn case and the other

674
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,840
is whether or not

675
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,120
there's an uh what is called an inner

676
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,959
flow spec

677
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,320
so moving down then there's the outer

678
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,520
flow spec and that's

679
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,039
uh matches an outer header which type is

680
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,559
determined by the uh

681
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,520
affy for the atheist fee that uh invoked

682
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,440
this parsing and interpretation then

683
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,320
there is the full spec for the tunnel

684
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,559
header itself

685
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
which

686
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,240
it could be extensive or could be

687
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,480
minimal depending on the kind of

688
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,679
tunneling and then if you have indicated

689
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,240
it's present that you can have an

690
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,519
optional inner flow spec and you have to

691
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,000
provide another affi

692
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,840
down there for that because uh you need

693
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,720
to indicate whether you want the inner

694
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,279
flow spec to match uh for example ipv4

695
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,320
or ipv6

696
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,240
next slide please

697
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,639
so here's a simple example where there

698
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,919
actually isn't anything to match in the

699
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,240
tunnel header it's ip and ip so you have

700
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,080
uh

701
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,279
that's the outer and an interflow spec

702
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,158
if you wanted to

703
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,159
match across those things um

704
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,399
you wouldn't do you you you initially be

705
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,880
matching probably uh the ip header but

706
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,360
if

707
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,480
it was in the vpn you might want to

708
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,840
match an initial

709
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,840
l2 header uh next exam slide bleed

710
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,480
this is a slightly more complicated uh

711
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,000
vxlan case in this case there is the

712
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
vxlan header

713
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,519
it can match fields in there and

714
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,840
similarly there's an outer and inner

715
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,279
flow specs uh and in this case the

716
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,799
interflip would be optional you might

717
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,399
want to only match

718
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,200
uh outer and some fields in the vxlan

719
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,600
header

720
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,960
like the vni or something and not match

721
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,439
anything on the inner header

722
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,799
so that is basically how the tunnel flow

723
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,679
spec works and

724
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,679
next slide please

725
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,000
so i believe that this draft is ready

726
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,120
for working group last call

727
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,120
um to uh

728
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,600
see what comments there are here at this

729
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,879
meeting and uh

730
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,719
perhaps in over the short period of time

731
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,919
and maybe do one revision and then

732
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,640
do work with last call perhaps

733
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,399
the ice jeff in the queue i mean happy

734
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,279
to hear what he has to say

735
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,279
yeah please go ahead

736
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,960
hi kittyrb yes yes

737
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,480
jeff um so donald uh we've gone through

738
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,600
a lot of learning as part of

739
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,679
working through the 5575 biz stuff uh

740
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,799
you are doing this as a new affy safy

741
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
pairing so

742
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,399
this is effectively ships in the knight

743
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,360
versus the other spec you really don't

744
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,120
have any real

745
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,559
dependencies as far as that piece is

746
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,799
concerned

747
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,918
uh the thing i have to ask though is

748
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,840
that

749
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,679
since you're sort of leveraging existing

750
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,279
encoding types you know

751
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,600
in terms of like the op fields as an

752
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,440
example that means that

753
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,120
as you're specifying things you're

754
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,440
vulnerable to one of the interesting

755
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:36,719
extension headaches that we found 5575

756
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,080
so basically since there's no yes go uh

757
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,760
i was just gonna say okay the

758
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,960
the uh this uh draft says that

759
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,279
for the matching the headers which is

760
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,399
the

761
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:51,039
really new you know substance uh

762
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,080
to be matched that there's a separate

763
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,480
registry

764
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,840
and um it's i believe it says

765
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,519
that they are all tlv format

766
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,840
so it doesn't say anything specific

767
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,639
about what to do

768
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,159
about unknown types for example

769
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,839
so maybe that's

770
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,280
something that should be clarified

771
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,520
possibly and i'm also realizing that i

772
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,000
was looking at uh version 8 rather than

773
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,440
version

774
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,399
10 where i see you've actually made a

775
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,599
bunch of changes so i think

776
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,719
i think i have to draw my comment well

777
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,839
okay i think you know it's looking at it

778
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,879
from the point of view

779
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,078
of extensions uh in the future for

780
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,319
example a new

781
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,240
tunnel header type uh is something

782
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,079
useful to do

783
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,598
okay i will re-review based on the

784
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:49,839
current draft for some reason i had

785
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,839
still cash okay thank you

786
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,720
oh hey donald uh i have a quick question

787
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,839
just

788
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,919
to see if i understand what you just

789
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,119
said to to jeff

790
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,440
so what you're doing is the encoding in

791
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,480
the

792
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,119
nlri of the operators right in the

793
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,040
components

794
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,240
to match is now tlv-based

795
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,960
yes yeah essentially um

796
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,759
the the fields being matched are all

797
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,640
either like

798
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,760
value fields or bit fields or something

799
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,598
like that so

800
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:27,040
the existing match operators

801
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:30,480
and um way the value to be matched

802
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,279
is encoded and the logic of having

803
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,280
multiple

804
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,800
of those uh and the ending and oring is

805
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,000
sort of all the same

806
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,320
but they're i believe all teals

807
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,440
they all have type and length at the

808
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,520
beginning

809
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,640
uh and so even though the value in

810
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,839
coding is

811
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:53,680
copied from uh earlier documents and

812
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:57,680
they have a it's a new registry within

813
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,759
uh types that can't conflict uh right so

814
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,839
okay so i have a question not for you

815
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,960
but uh maybe for

816
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:10,640
the chairs um well we were doing

817
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,839
uh 5575 bis and the v6

818
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,839
flow spec

819
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,240
the answer to a lot of the questions

820
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,920
about sensibility and other things was

821
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,399
we're going to be working on flow spec

822
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
v2

823
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:30,320
now it seems that 52x75 bis

824
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,079
this solution and flow spec v2 whatever

825
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,640
that is

826
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,320
may all be three different things like

827
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,640
ships of the knight right

828
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,599
is that what we're talking about is that

829
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,920
the direction we're going

830
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,079
am i completely confused do i need to go

831
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,200
to sleep

832
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,560
all our possible options i need to go to

833
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,598
sleep um

834
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:58,320
sue do you want to take this yeah

835
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,320
i'll take this so alvaro um

836
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,720
you've hit a point that i was gonna

837
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,000
raise anyway

838
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,520
here's our challenge working group this

839
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,359
draft was adopted before we got into the

840
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,640
understanding

841
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,640
of um

842
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,560
how much tlvs are problematic i was

843
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,759
hoping that

844
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,119
jeff had read the most recent version

845
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,359
i think i need to do a qual before we do

846
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,280
a working group last call that says

847
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,440
should this go uh

848
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,760
are are you feeling an urgency to do

849
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,359
this now or shall we wrap this

850
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:46,640
into the um

851
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,640
two and i think i need to see

852
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,079
what the working group wants uh john and

853
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,880
i

854
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,440
specifically limited the first three

855
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,440
things

856
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,800
to what the operators told us which is

857
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:05,760
uh 5575 bis v6

858
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,520
because the isgs strongly wanted it and

859
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,720
so did the operators

860
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,839
and the oid because the operators wanted

861
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,279
it

862
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,320
i would love comments now we also can

863
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,800
take comments

864
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,079
john should we take this to the list

865
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,800
because of time

866
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,839
or shall we allow our time is okay for

867
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,320
it for now so let's

868
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,520
let's go ahead and conversation girl i'd

869
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,839
i'd like some

870
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:34,240
feedback should we delay this

871
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:34,240
to um

872
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,520
is anybody are the opportunities waiting

873
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,400
for this

874
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,040
or as i've announced it's time to start

875
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,079
v2

876
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,320
shall we put this in v2 this document

877
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,720
with what donald's done

878
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,960
starts to have all the tlvs we don't

879
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,359
know if there's any problems

880
00:38:50,960 --> 00:39:01,839
it's sort of going toward that direction

881
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:01,839
feedback working group

882
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,599
jeff please go ahead and and that was my

883
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,640
call for feedback anybody want to make

884
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,050
any comments

885
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,598
now it may be uh

886
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,640
[Applause]

887
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,280
i'll early three very brief ones um the

888
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,480
first one

889
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,880
is do we one way you're gonna fit

890
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,359
downflow suspect uh as v2

891
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,240
that's an open question uh we we could

892
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,880
certainly

893
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,160
i think the interesting question that

894
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,560
drives that more than

895
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,319
uh you know do we have to do it just for

896
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,119
your niceness of encoding

897
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,720
is really whether or not uh you know use

898
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,599
cases for

899
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,118
this draft are intended to overlap ever

900
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,079
the stuff in the existing flows back

901
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,200
documents

902
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,119
because then what you would end up

903
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,680
having is basically firewall rules that

904
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,920
in

905
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,879
one case deals with the tunneled stuff

906
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,880
and then you have

907
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,359
a different case of no overlapping with

908
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,359
the existing use cases

909
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:57,520
if the two are intended to be mixed at

910
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,279
some point having them as separate after

911
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,440
saffies is a little weird

912
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,760
if it really can live as ships at night

913
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,040
even if it's just temporary because of

914
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
a strong need for the use case to be

915
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,839
deployed nothing stops somebody from

916
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,520
shipping

917
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,440
you know basically this version of the

918
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,280
draft to cover the use case

919
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,680
and then we end up with spec v2 we end

920
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:24,480
up in the merged form

921
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:26,399
that's my comment

922
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,560
thanks any other any other comments

923
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,920
right now show of hands

924
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,640
thing uh see if we can get some sense

925
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,599
can i make a brief comment i i just

926
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,400
wanted to say that i think that uh

927
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,880
a working group last call would cause uh

928
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
greater

929
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,240
working group attention and review of

930
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,599
this document and

931
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,959
uh that would perhaps yield

932
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,160
uh something which clearly

933
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,200
better expressed the need

934
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,520
what the actual uh you know requirements

935
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,960
and

936
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,640
an adequate mechanism would be uh

937
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,960
certainly the uh the flowspec needs

938
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,879
as indicated by this draft should be one

939
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:21,839
of the inputs to the v2 effort

940
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:21,839
i would think that was my company

941
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,160
okay donald do you feel like uh

942
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:31,599
i i any other comments

943
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,480
uh from other people

944
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,440
john do we have people in the mic queue

945
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,960
we do not

946
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,960
um i think that we can

947
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,919
move on and discuss this in the list and

948
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,200
i think that you know donald has a

949
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,000
valid point that a working group last

950
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,078
call is

951
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,079
often a good forcing function anyway so

952
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,280
if we want to discuss it in that context

953
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,279
i think it would be reasonable

954
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,839
it will start there but i'll put some

955
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,440
details in the working group last call

956
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,799
um regarding close back me too and

957
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,520
um sounds good

958
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,640
okay john i think donald anything else

959
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,359
you'd like to say

960
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,078
about the working group last call uh

961
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,078
nope

962
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,920
uh i'm in favor of it but other than

963
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:30,160
that

964
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:33,040
thank you

965
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,160
hello everyone can you hear me yes we

966
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,960
can

967
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,520
okay thank you so today i'm going to

968
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,960
talk about

969
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:44,640
the updates for the rpd dropped

970
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,720
next page

971
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,279
so first i would say thank you very much

972
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,720
for all the people

973
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,839
who give a lot of comments around the

974
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:00,879
working kubernetes call so especially

975
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:04,078
robot download caitlyn and jacob

976
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,240
so after we receive those

977
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:11,760
comments and then we update the document

978
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,040
and then address i think

979
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,400
we think and we address the those

980
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,000
comments

981
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,960
so those comments can be classified

982
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,920
three three groups one group is that

983
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,599
we already have configurations we can

984
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,800
for

985
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,520
dynamic adjuster traffic

986
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,040
we can do this job through

987
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,160
configurations

988
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,800
so why do we need rpd

989
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,759
for dynamic traffic adjustment so that's

990
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,319
the one group of

991
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,880
comments so another group of comments is

992
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,599
that

993
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
so in in the older document so it looks

994
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,920
like that

995
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:54,160
the rpd route is distributed through

996
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,520
p2p or p2mp

997
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,440
so in this latest document so we update

998
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,480
and we with more details

999
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,079
so from this latest document we can see

1000
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,720
that

1001
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:12,640
the rpd route is distributed

1002
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:16,078
p to m p is not p to p

1003
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,720
so the third group of uh comments is

1004
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,920
about uh

1005
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,359
the issues about failures so when really

1006
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,960
happens

1007
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,319
so what happens for this kind of uh

1008
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,520
traffic adjustments so we address this

1009
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,040
three group of comments uh we already

1010
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,880
addressed this through commonly in the

1011
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,160
document today we just

1012
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:40,560
briefly talk about the uh

1013
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,799
what how we address these comments next

1014
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,799
switch

1015
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,520
so for for operational network so we

1016
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,400
already have tons of configurations

1017
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,759
so in order to adjust the traffic

1018
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,760
dynamically

1019
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,720
so we can use the configurations but

1020
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,520
if we use configurations to dynamically

1021
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,879
adjust the

1022
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,119
traffic so because we already have tons

1023
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,440
of

1024
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,040
existing relatively stable

1025
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,800
configurations

1026
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,200
um number of nodes in the matter for

1027
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,599
example we have tons of configurations

1028
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,799
on node a and then we have tons of

1029
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,760
configuration node b

1030
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,240
and so on so in order to adjust the

1031
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,359
traffic

1032
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,160
dynamically as soon as we want to adjust

1033
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,520
the traffic

1034
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,520
then we need put or push

1035
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,160
some configurations to sum to those some

1036
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,319
of the loads in the network

1037
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,520
because this adjust of traffic is

1038
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,079
dynamic

1039
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,599
so we the frequency may be sometimes

1040
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,079
high and then

1041
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,319
so this kind of configuration change and

1042
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,359
some of the nodes of the network

1043
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,720
will be very sometimes frequent and then

1044
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,598
sometimes maybe it's

1045
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,759
not that frequent so with this kind of

1046
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,760
uh

1047
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,640
operation so change configuration on

1048
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,400
some of those and then delete the

1049
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,359
configuration of something nodes

1050
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,800
for dynamic adjust traffic will have

1051
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,000
some issues for example

1052
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:15,040
this kind of operation is very complex

1053
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,119
and error-prone in addition to that

1054
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,720
this kind of dynamic we have a stable

1055
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,599
configuration and then we have the name

1056
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,640
calculation keep

1057
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,359
changing so this is hard for for

1058
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,598
operator

1059
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,799
for operators to maintain this kind of

1060
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,920
things

1061
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,839
so with the rpd ross

1062
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,960
and then this issues or problems

1063
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,680
is well is so is resolved so that's the

1064
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,839
reason

1065
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:43,839
we use rpd next page

1066
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,319
so i us so another group of comments

1067
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,439
from the

1068
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,800
logical is that of

1069
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,920
people say that this kind of uh rpd

1070
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,400
wrong distribution is a p2p and even

1071
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,960
though they can be a p2mp so we just

1072
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,839
disk

1073
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,040
this one so we through updates document

1074
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,520
with more details

1075
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,599
and then through this update so we can

1076
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,960
see that

1077
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:16,400
rp raw distribution is p2

1078
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,839
mp is about a p2p so here we show a

1079
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,480
typical application scenarios so in this

1080
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,000
network

1081
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:28,880
we have a 1s s1 and then we have

1082
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,200
another two as s2 and s3 so

1083
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,240
here we we have a controller and that

1084
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,279
controller is

1085
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,000
is connected to a router reflector so

1086
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,160
this rolls reflector is connected to

1087
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,280
all the other nodes so here we just show

1088
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,879
the nodes a b and c

1089
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,839
so you want to adjust traffic

1090
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,880
dynamically

1091
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:56,480
so we just met controller send

1092
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,559
rpg routes to load reflector

1093
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,200
then router reflector reflects

1094
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,160
those rp rows to order routes to all the

1095
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,680
routers

1096
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,720
here for example the rp route will be

1097
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:15,919
send it to a and b and c

1098
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:19,680
so this is a p2p it's not not a p2mp

1099
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,640
so after each of the routers receive

1100
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,680
these

1101
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,680
rpd routes so it will

1102
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:28,640
apply the policy included in this rp

1103
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,759
route

1104
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,480
to to to the

1105
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,359
to the routers or or according to the

1106
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,960
peers or

1107
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:42,000
for example we can apply those

1108
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,440
policies controlled by

1109
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,839
the pip address so if a pip address

1110
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,440
is zero then that means we will apply

1111
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:52,480
the policy to order

1112
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,839
all the ps so if this

1113
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,640
p address is a determined is not zero

1114
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:59,599
that means we just apply that policy to

1115
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,040
data

1116
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:07,599
to that ps so in fact this peer

1117
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:10,880
ip doesn't change the pwp behavior over

1118
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:17,839
traditional pgp

1119
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,839
so that's nice

1120
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,760
so the last of the group issue is about

1121
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,160
about failures

1122
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,920
so so the thing is we can classify

1123
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,078
different types one type is that

1124
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:33,200
the failure is a because of bach

1125
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,040
for example failure the route is fair

1126
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,200
if we cannot of a route

1127
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,400
fails to install the routes in the

1128
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,720
folding table

1129
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,000
so this is out of our control this is

1130
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,279
the box so we need to fix

1131
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,119
this bug so this is a

1132
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,559
fairly easy to qualify this video is out

1133
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,200
of

1134
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,839
of the this document so another thing is

1135
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,759
that

1136
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,000
we can have controller failure we can

1137
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,040
have a failure of illustrations between

1138
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,480
the controller and the router reflector

1139
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,680
so for these kind of failures so

1140
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,800
we can use existing

1141
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:13,200
gr so we can use the basic jr so

1142
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,240
in this case either controller failure

1143
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,799
or session failure

1144
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,759
and then those of the routes for use for

1145
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,160
adjustment traffic

1146
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,920
can stay there for some time so if we

1147
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,078
use we think that this time it's not a

1148
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:29,440
long enough so we can use a long leaf

1149
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:33,440
restart so in this case we can keep that

1150
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:37,119
route for adjusting traffic longer

1151
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,960
so in what's the case so even so we use

1152
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,240
this kind of a

1153
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:46,400
great gr try to keep

1154
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:49,200
the route for adjusting trafficker

1155
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,079
get withdrawn so in this case the worst

1156
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,480
case is that

1157
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,800
even though this uh christmas doesn't

1158
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,240
work for this case

1159
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:01,520
we go back to the original

1160
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,479
routes that means we try we try to use

1161
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,759
the

1162
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,960
rpv rules to adjust traffic

1163
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,440
to the base of the routes we think but

1164
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,880
because of a failure those are adjust

1165
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,920
the votes for adjustments

1166
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,720
get withdrawn then those

1167
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,920
traffic will fall back to the original

1168
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,680
pass

1169
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,760
so i think that this one even in the

1170
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,799
worst case i think it is acceptable just

1171
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,440
though we

1172
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,880
but this edge rounds for a chat to

1173
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,079
traffic it doesn't

1174
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,880
um doesn't take effect

1175
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,880
so next page

1176
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,119
so we would like to also get comments

1177
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,160
after we address

1178
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,160
the existing comments

1179
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,720
okay well

1180
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,720
questions and comments on the list then

1181
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,720
please thank you okay thank you

1182
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,839
yeah please go ahead

1183
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:28,079
really if you're speaking we can't hear

1184
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,839
you

1185
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,160
yelling sound check

1186
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
still can't hear you

1187
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,719
[Music]

1188
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,839
hmm

1189
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,920
yeah i think uh i think g's suggestion

1190
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,839
is good and

1191
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,040
we should move on to the next presenter

1192
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,880
and you know they should

1193
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,480
work on audio in the meantime and we can

1194
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,079
come back

1195
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,520
okay so we're going to switch we're

1196
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,280
going to continue to the next uh

1197
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,040
next talk and then we'll come back once

1198
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,839
yeli has audio

1199
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,839
worked out

1200
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,880
all right so next present please

1201
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,839
wait do we have sound from ula oh

1202
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,200
hello hi john hello yes

1203
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,040
oh yeah i have some problem

1204
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,598
good to hear you okay please go ahead

1205
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,720
okay thank you sorry for that

1206
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:37,280
okay this is uh a draft about

1207
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:40,959
the ipad capability and advertisements

1208
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:45,359
we have defined extension to bgp

1209
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,359
protocol next page please

1210
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:55,200
yeah so in let's draft we mentioned

1211
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:59,040
i think were to refer

1212
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:02,879
to the family of the unpassed telemetry

1213
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:06,079
techniques we include

1214
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:10,000
in this terminology has

1215
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:13,920
the iom and the alternate marking

1216
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,960
method and we also considering the

1217
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:21,119
iphage domain it means that

1218
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:24,079
the perverse measurement domain so

1219
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,880
from the security consideration size to

1220
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,480
to avoid

1221
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,599
the i feed data leakage outside the

1222
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,400
domain so

1223
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,359
we need to make sure that i face the

1224
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,240
capsulating node

1225
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,759
that is the tail nodes must remove the

1226
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,759
data field

1227
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:47,119
so uh so that's why we

1228
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,240
extend to the bgp protocol to

1229
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:54,079
advertise the iphone

1230
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:57,439
the capsulation node capability

1231
00:55:54,079 --> 00:56:01,280
to the head node so

1232
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,000
taking less extension to bgp protocol

1233
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,280
the head node

1234
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,280
can collect the information

1235
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,839
and to know uh whether the tail node can

1236
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,760
support

1237
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:18,880
the specified effect capability

1238
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:22,559
before insert the ipad command

1239
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,839
into the traffic packet so

1240
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:29,680
from this motivation we we

1241
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:32,720
defined two options in let's drop

1242
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,279
to make the extension to b2p the first

1243
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,399
of all

1244
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,760
is the extension to ipv6

1245
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:43,040
as v6 and ipv 4

1246
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:46,160
address specific extended community

1247
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:47,040
and the second option is to extend to

1248
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,558
the bgp

1249
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,558
next top capability

1250
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,470
yeah from

1251
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,680
yes next thanks so from

1252
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,279
[Music]

1253
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,598
first of all we we need to define the uh

1254
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,880
f8 capability what what is the

1255
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:09,839
capability

1256
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:12,880
so here we mentioned the format

1257
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:15,920
field we defined in less dot

1258
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:19,040
uh here we see this this is a

1259
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,640
16 bit bitmap field it can

1260
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,880
include the five um

1261
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:29,920
options uh a bit

1262
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,040
uh to indicate what kind or which kind

1263
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,079
of the

1264
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,279
performance management method uh can be

1265
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,480
supported

1266
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,599
at the the tail nodes it

1267
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:46,079
includes ion and alternate marking

1268
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:49,599
uh method next thanks

1269
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:53,760
uh next slide yes

1270
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:57,359
so here is the option one um

1271
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:58,799
it is an extension to bdp uh extended

1272
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,319
community

1273
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:05,520
uh here we are considering

1274
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:09,279
to extend to the ipv6

1275
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:12,319
and the v4 address specific i think

1276
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,680
extended community uh we're considering

1277
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:17,440
this is the

1278
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,480
a transitive optional extended community

1279
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,520
so we can use this to

1280
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:26,559
uh uh to notify

1281
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:30,319
the the iphat's capability

1282
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:31,280
to uh uh observe the tail node to its

1283
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:34,720
partner

1284
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,760
i mean the effects encapsulation node

1285
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,480
so here uh from this two figure we can

1286
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,920
see that

1287
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:45,559
the format and in this

1288
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,559
format the optional uh

1289
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:52,160
ipv4 address uh and

1290
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,640
and the v6 address is the address of the

1291
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,759
iphas

1292
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:59,040
encapsulation node yeah

1293
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,319
uh next piece please

1294
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:06,160
so yeah that this is the option two uh

1295
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:09,839
is it extension to the bgp next top

1296
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:13,118
capability so as we

1297
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:16,480
see the working groups are draft defined

1298
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:20,960
bgp network capability is a

1299
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:24,480
a non-traditive bdp attribute so

1300
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:28,319
we can consider use this in in the

1301
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:31,359
uh intro domain so to notify the

1302
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:32,960
tail nodes uh capability to the head

1303
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,078
nodes

1304
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:39,200
here we also defined the format

1305
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:41,200
based on the working group jobs defines

1306
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:44,640
the next scope capability

1307
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:47,520
and we extend to the

1308
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,040
effect capability include in the

1309
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:52,400
capability value

1310
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:55,680
field yeah

1311
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,960
and next yes yeah

1312
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,399
this is all the content defined in

1313
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:04,400
desktops

1314
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,799
and any questions and comments

1315
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,799
thank you

1316
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,720
thanks uh any many comments

1317
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,480
okay q is empty so let us continue thank

1318
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:29,839
you

1319
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:29,839
thank you

1320
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:44,400
just go ahead okay thank you

1321
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:48,799
and i'm yael from zt and

1322
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:51,520
this draft is about the bgp extensions

1323
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,559
of sr policy for end-to-end power

1324
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,839
protection

1325
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:57,839
next like this

1326
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,680
when essa policies are involved and the

1327
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,640
strict complaints of the sr policy is

1328
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,480
required

1329
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,279
the end-to-end protection should be

1330
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,760
preferred over local repair mechanism

1331
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:13,280
it is introduced in the sr policy

1332
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,520
architecture draft

1333
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,040
that candidate power can be used for

1334
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,680
path protection

1335
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,960
and and sr policy allows for multiple

1336
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,160
kennedy powers and

1337
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,400
only one hectic candidate parts can be

1338
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,598
provisioned in the forwarding plan at

1339
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,079
the same time

1340
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:31,359
so other lower preference can in the

1341
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,400
past may be used

1342
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:38,160
as a backup house when distributing

1343
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:41,680
sr policies using pdp

1344
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:44,078
each candida path is carrying an mli

1345
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,480
so far there also no mechanism to carry

1346
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,200
the protection relationship from kennedy

1347
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,160
park

1348
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,720
in bgp advertisement and of course we

1349
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:56,319
can do it by local configuration

1350
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,319
and backup candidate provides protection

1351
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:00,079
only when the segment lists in the

1352
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,440
active canada house

1353
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,559
are invalid it is not flexible enough in

1354
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,440
scenarios like load balancing for

1355
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,079
example

1356
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,359
uh candidate pass one is the hectic

1357
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,480
candidate pass

1358
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,440
and the flows are load balanced between

1359
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,079
segment list

1360
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,880
one and two candidate pass two will take

1361
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:22,400
place only when both segments one and

1362
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,359
two are invalid

1363
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,480
if you want to prove for protect second

1364
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,640
laser one

1365
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,599
so flows can still be load balanced

1366
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,000
between

1367
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,000
second laser two and the back up path

1368
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,160
after seven minutes long field

1369
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,079
using canadian parts for protection can

1370
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,879
not achieve that goal

1371
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,079
and this document proposes extensions of

1372
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,960
vgp

1373
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:46,240
in order to provide pass protection use

1374
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,359
segment lists

1375
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:52,240
when delivering as a policy

1376
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,240
next slide please

1377
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,439
settlement list can be used solely or

1378
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,799
combined with kennedy pass together for

1379
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,440
pass protection

1380
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:05,680
on this figure gives an example the

1381
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,760
harriet node has received two

1382
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,960
candidate parts belong to the cmsr

1383
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,400
policy and

1384
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,400
cp1 has the higher preference so cp1 is

1385
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,240
chosen as a primary pass

1386
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:20,720
and in cp 1 list 3 is a backup

1387
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,598
list so it will not be enabled on the

1388
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,640
data plane at

1389
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,760
first after this one fails the 3 will

1390
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,960
take place

1391
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:32,720
if list 2 and this 3 are both invalid

1392
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,599
that cd2 can be enabled for protection

1393
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:35,598
next slide please

1394
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,480
here are the bgp extensions for sr

1395
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:43,839
policy

1396
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,440
proposing this draft and the b flag in

1397
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:48,078
segment list sub-tree

1398
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,720
indicates the segment list acts as a

1399
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:53,760
pure backup part in the kennedy pass

1400
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:56,640
and this identifier trv is used to

1401
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,839
identify the corresponding segment list

1402
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,640
and it contains the optional sub theory

1403
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:04,078
list protection theory which carries the

1404
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:07,759
protection relationship

1405
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:10,000
of segmentations the rightmost signal

1406
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,960
shows the position of the newly defined

1407
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,240
theories in

1408
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:16,480
advertisement of sr policy next slide

1409
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,479
please

1410
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,879
and in the tlsp

1411
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:26,640
distribution draft they could describe a

1412
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,039
mechanism to collect

1413
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,480
the sr the policy information that is

1414
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,760
locally available

1415
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:37,039
in the node and advertise it into

1416
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:40,880
pgpos updates and it it

1417
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:44,240
includes sr candidate pass state cov

1418
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:47,520
and has a settlement list to trv

1419
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:50,959
and the sab flag who

1420
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,240
are originally defining can we deposit a

1421
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,720
tree well the

1422
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:57,038
extracting the case the candida parts is

1423
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:59,680
an administrative sharp state

1424
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,480
and pay flag in the case can it pass in

1425
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:03,200
the active

1426
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,119
part and b flat in the case of kenya

1427
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,879
park is a backup

1428
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,599
and two new flat two new flags are

1429
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,520
introduced

1430
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:16,000
in this draft in sr segment list

1431
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,680
tlv to offer more details of the

1432
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,119
settlement list states

1433
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,839
and the s flat and the b flat as

1434
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,799
a similar meaning and the s flag

1435
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,279
indicates a second

1436
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,839
list using the administrative chart

1437
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,839
state

1438
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:32,078
and the b flag indicates the settlement

1439
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,880
list is a backup part

1440
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:40,559
can be next like please and anything

1441
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,559
will pass feedback some comments

1442
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:51,839
except

1443
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,640
okay please go ahead

1444
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:03,839
uh thanks for the update of

1445
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,280
your draft what i would suggest is some

1446
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:07,599
of the proposals here

1447
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,000
like you know having a primary and

1448
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,359
backup semantic within segment list of

1449
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,319
a candidate part i mean this isn't

1450
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:17,119
something that is

1451
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:19,359
covered by the base specifications in

1452
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:22,000
spring working group

1453
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,759
also this notion of uh you know primary

1454
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,119
and backup candidate path that is

1455
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,160
something which is covered to some

1456
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,200
extent

1457
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,680
but then there is also uh you know the

1458
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:35,680
way the candidate part selection happens

1459
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:38,319
what i would recommend is that please

1460
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,879
get the work reviewed and hopefully

1461
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:45,200
adopted in the spring working group

1462
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:48,240
before adding protocol extensions for it

1463
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:51,680
it's just a suggestion yeah and

1464
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,240
uh i i was going to make a similar

1465
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,038
comment

1466
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,598
which is that you know the the proposed

1467
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,799
encoding

1468
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:01,359
seem fine but the uh the

1469
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,000
underlying idea seems like it's

1470
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:06,000
something that

1471
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
um spring should review at least

1472
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:13,440
okay i'll check the comments and

1473
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,799
then to the screen for you thanks great

1474
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,680
thank you

1475
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,680
any other comments

1476
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:26,559
if not then we will continue forward

1477
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,559
linda are you here

1478
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:34,160
yes yep loud and clear

1479
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:37,359
oh good okay so here

1480
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:40,240
um we want to propose a new path

1481
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:41,359
attribute in the bgp mri called app

1482
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:44,479
metadata

1483
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:46,319
are the purposes for 5g edge computing

1484
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,359
service

1485
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,359
next page please

1486
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:59,839
okay so the purpose is to um

1487
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,440
for the 5g edge computing be able to

1488
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:05,200
propagate

1489
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:08,079
the running status including environment

1490
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,279
including site prefix site preference or

1491
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,240
capacity

1492
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,240
into the ingress router for them to make

1493
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,599
intelligent decisions

1494
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,238
to achieve optimal performance and the

1495
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:24,880
user experience

1496
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:28,238
next page

1497
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,960
so a little bit background um 5g edge

1498
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:33,278
computing

1499
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:37,120
is a project in the 3gpp sa2

1500
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:40,400
and this is defined in the tr23 748

1501
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:44,479
or the release 17 they have

1502
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:48,399
identified many use cases for example

1503
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:51,759
drone communication with controller

1504
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:55,519
they require back-end servers

1505
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:59,520
to be very close to the device

1506
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:02,239
and also they require multiple servers

1507
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,960
for the same applications so you could

1508
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,080
have

1509
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:09,359
5g sites and each of the cell

1510
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:12,799
tower to uh to have this um

1511
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,960
back-end server hosted

1512
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,000
and they have virtual interactive

1513
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,640
conference

1514
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,279
uh all those use cases being identified

1515
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,199
there

1516
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,719
all have the requirement of the short

1517
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:25,678
delay um

1518
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,399
so one of the characteristics of 5g

1519
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,239
system

1520
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:33,120
is the size are very close in proximity

1521
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:35,759
so you can have one side like you have a

1522
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,880
bunch of ues user device

1523
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:42,319
anchored into psa psa means

1524
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:44,799
packet section anchor and they go to the

1525
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:48,080
local data network

1526
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:52,080
and you could have another psa too

1527
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:53,920
in very close proximity so for the

1528
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,280
server back-end server you could have

1529
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,440
multiple

1530
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:03,840
copy of them very close nearby

1531
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,839
next page please

1532
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,440
so from ip perspective right we are

1533
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,639
working on the the plumbing from the

1534
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,440
networking side ip layer um more and

1535
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,640
more

1536
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:20,320
the trend is to use anycast address

1537
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:22,719
to represent all those duplicate servers

1538
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,480
not duplicate multiple servers for one

1539
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,520
application

1540
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:30,080
any cast have lots of advantages

1541
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,239
but traditionally have been used in many

1542
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,480
like far

1543
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,519
away at your perfect geographic

1544
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,639
locations

1545
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,679
so the the benefit of anycast

1546
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,640
is really for network to expose

1547
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,760
to utilize or leverage the network

1548
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,760
routing layer

1549
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:52,800
to help application to achieve better

1550
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,520
performance and to eliminate the

1551
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,560
single point of failure of the local dns

1552
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,960
resolvers

1553
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,239
or the application low server load

1554
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,880
balancers

1555
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,400
and also many client in the fixed

1556
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,600
network or in the mobile

1557
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,320
or ue um tend to use their cache

1558
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,679
ip addresses for extended period of time

1559
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,400
so even if you have

1560
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,600
local dns resolver in each of the local

1561
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,879
data network

1562
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:22,000
um you when they move to a new location

1563
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:25,199
they may not resolve to find a new

1564
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,520
ip address so

1565
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:29,759
the benefits are great but they're also

1566
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,960
bring a bunch of issues

1567
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:36,480
um one of the key issues is um

1568
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,679
um when all those servers are very close

1569
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:41,120
in proximity

1570
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:44,400
the routing distance routing cost

1571
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,559
can be very small and

1572
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,440
is smaller than other factors for

1573
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,800
example

1574
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:53,678
in this example you can have eas eas

1575
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,320
meaning edge computing application

1576
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,320
server

1577
01:11:54,320 --> 01:12:01,440
one in local data network one

1578
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:05,759
um has high capacity

1579
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:09,678
versus eas2 in ldn2

1580
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:11,360
is over over utilized so when the ue

1581
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,800
moved to

1582
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:18,159
anchor to the psa2 the performance

1583
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,080
um overall performance will be better

1584
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:22,080
if they are still served by their

1585
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:25,360
original es1

1586
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,480
so the many factors are affecting

1587
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,360
where the routing is um another issue

1588
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,519
that

1589
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,639
quite different bring in by this edge

1590
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,480
computing is

1591
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,679
um from the psa2 the

1592
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:43,199
package session anchor 2 there could be

1593
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:47,280
many ues already anchored there and they

1594
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:51,280
using their local algorithm to choose

1595
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:54,400
the the right edge server maybe eas2

1596
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:58,480
but when the ue one move from the

1597
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:00,879
uh anchor ps psa1 to psa2

1598
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,239
the better service will be provided by

1599
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,800
es2 so

1600
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:06,239
same destination same address the

1601
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,600
performance can be

1602
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:14,159
uh based on different uh source can be

1603
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:16,719
can be different um next page

1604
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:17,360
uh sure linda do you want to take uh

1605
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,640
questions

1606
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:23,839
interactively or hold until the end sure

1607
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,840
if it's not too long

1608
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:30,239
okay so you go ahead i'm just wondering

1609
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:35,199
if it's an anycast address

1610
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:38,400
how do you uh buy how do you uh

1611
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:41,678
find an a ue to a server

1612
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,799
because you don't want it to uh assuming

1613
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:47,840
their their state associated with uh

1614
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:51,600
the ue

1615
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:53,679
um okay so so you mean that when the ue

1616
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,560
moved to a new location how do you apply

1617
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,760
oh i mean if you're dynamically load

1618
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,920
balancing

1619
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,800
how do you how do you again how do you

1620
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,640
pin a ue

1621
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,920
to an app server if it's in anycast

1622
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,679
address

1623
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,679
okay okay so um in in today especially

1624
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:12,320
if you look at ipv6 right

1625
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:14,159
um they have a flow label so many

1626
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,679
today's routers support

1627
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:20,799
um putting all the flows all the packing

1628
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:24,159
within one flow into one path

1629
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,960
okay that's one criteria later on i can

1630
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,839
explain

1631
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,120
some of the criteria for them put into

1632
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,679
the ingress router

1633
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,199
so that they can guarantee that a packet

1634
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,080
belonging to one flow

1635
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:37,599
always anchor into one particular

1636
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,920
instance of anycast

1637
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,920
server

1638
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:43,839
okay

1639
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,839
why

1640
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,040
i'm assuming you can hear me uh can you

1641
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,080
yeah i can hear you now

1642
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,080
okay good um i don't know linda if it

1643
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,840
helps i see that you're

1644
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,760
i mean i see one slide that talks about

1645
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,239
within the market i see another slide

1646
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,840
that talks across markets

1647
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:12,400
and i know you're trying to kind of

1648
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,159
represent the ip network but

1649
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,239
i don't know if it helps if you can draw

1650
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,199
out you know the du cu

1651
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,919
upf because you know in the old days

1652
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:21,839
that was all

1653
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,600
you know backhaul now between frontal

1654
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,280
mental and backhaul

1655
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:29,040
when you call an ip network i don't know

1656
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,040
which area you're talking about so maybe

1657
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:35,679
that's a very good very good comment if

1658
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,560
you bring back to the first page

1659
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,560
previous page

1660
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,199
john if you can bring up the previous

1661
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:46,480
page so um

1662
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:47,440
in this network um obviously from the

1663
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,120
base station

1664
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:54,000
um e note b to the psa

1665
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,360
that's within 5g system so they have ip

1666
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,560
network as well

1667
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:02,559
um there's a draft in the dmn

1668
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:06,159
on the tn aware mobility about network

1669
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:08,880
within the 5g they have net ip network

1670
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,679
here i'm talking about a local data

1671
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,600
network

1672
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:17,199
after the upf so upf and psa

1673
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:20,560
is um psa is a function of the upf user

1674
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:23,839
user um user packet function right upf

1675
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:26,560
um so the ldn local network

1676
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,520
data network is completely ip network

1677
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:35,840
outside

1678
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:35,840
um the the 5g is serving the 5g system

1679
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:42,239
okay so maybe later i can um

1680
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:44,960
refine the um the the description

1681
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:47,919
maybe in the draft hopefully um people

1682
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,920
can get more comments

1683
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,159
i guess he'll put himself back in the

1684
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:02,880
queue if it's not okay

1685
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:05,839
um so then so this page is about um

1686
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,719
in the 5g edge computing service um to

1687
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,000
select

1688
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,800
a particular edge server um

1689
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,760
traditionally anycast is purely based on

1690
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,280
the network

1691
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:20,239
routing cost right um but in the

1692
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,960
5g edge computing environment for

1693
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:23,839
example

1694
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,719
s1 here and they are in three different

1695
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,920
locations

1696
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:31,520
because three different local network um

1697
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:33,920
and the network routing um distance

1698
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:34,880
uh maybe there's difference um the

1699
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:36,880
round-trip time

1700
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,159
maybe a little bit different but there's

1701
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:41,280
other factors

1702
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:44,799
for example um s1 could be

1703
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:48,320
a bigger capacity um l

1704
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:51,280
s one l d one could be bigger capacity

1705
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:52,559
i could have multiple servers behind a

1706
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:56,559
load balancer

1707
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,880
than the s1 in the ld3

1708
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,640
there could be a side preference like

1709
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:04,239
network capacity preference

1710
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:05,280
for example in the r1 that's like a mini

1711
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:08,080
data center

1712
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:09,199
the capacity there is much higher than

1713
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:13,360
the capacity

1714
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:16,559
um next to the r2 uh there could be that

1715
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:20,159
for particular ue1 that he

1716
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:23,760
actually initially anchored to psa1

1717
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:27,199
upf1 and go to the ldn1

1718
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:29,679
s1 when he moved to the side b

1719
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:31,280
which is maybe very close to each other

1720
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,320
um the capacity

1721
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:37,120
over taking the network

1722
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,239
delay so the quite a few different

1723
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:41,360
factors

1724
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:42,159
for the ingress router to consider to

1725
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,960
choose

1726
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:49,920
uh optimal optimal of any cast location

1727
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,880
um that's why we want to introduce some

1728
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,080
matrix

1729
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:58,480
for the egress router r1 r3

1730
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:00,320
r2 to propagate it to the

1731
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,599
ingress router which make decision

1732
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,559
importing

1733
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,560
next page please

1734
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:14,159
okay so here is why we need uh this mat

1735
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,960
application metadata um so this is um

1736
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:17,920
a new uh path attributes uh which

1737
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:21,280
include

1738
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:24,880
um load measurement meaning for the

1739
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:27,440
each of the egress router which have the

1740
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,320
server application servers directly

1741
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,519
attached

1742
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:34,880
be able to do some measurement on the

1743
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:37,520
traffic flow to and from the server

1744
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,239
um there is a capacity index this

1745
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,280
capacity

1746
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:43,440
index can be pre-configured

1747
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:45,199
or could be learned based on historic

1748
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,678
data

1749
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:49,599
and there is a site preference so the

1750
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:52,320
site preference can be dynamic

1751
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:53,440
based on who is accessing it depending

1752
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,360
on different ue

1753
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,199
the preference could be different so

1754
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:00,080
with all those combinations

1755
01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:00,639
added together the ingress router can

1756
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,199
make

1757
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,080
intelligent decision in the draft

1758
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:07,280
there's a

1759
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:10,159
we give an example um algorithm um

1760
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,120
how the ingress router utilize different

1761
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,360
attributes

1762
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,639
to compute the index to choose which

1763
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:17,599
side to use

1764
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,960
um there's also other factors to be

1765
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,800
considered

1766
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:25,199
in the rtg there's a draft on the

1767
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,639
make it transport network transport

1768
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,280
aware mobility

1769
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:31,040
so basically that drive is about within

1770
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,320
the 5g

1771
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,120
that gdp tunnel they use udp port range

1772
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,840
to represent

1773
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,880
different priority or different slicing

1774
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,199
of the network

1775
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,400
and those information can be passed

1776
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:45,599
through the

1777
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,080
5g network exposure function

1778
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:49,920
to the local ip network and that

1779
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,600
information can also be

1780
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:57,520
carried by the pgp's app metadata

1781
01:20:53,600 --> 01:21:02,560
tlb to pass to relevant

1782
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:02,560
routers next page please

1783
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,199
um here is the load measurement as the

1784
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:12,639
router itself

1785
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:16,239
we most likely applications

1786
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:19,280
are encrypted they don't give us

1787
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:22,080
information about the internal logic

1788
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,360
and from the plumbing side we can only

1789
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,080
see

1790
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,559
the packets going into the router going

1791
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,840
to the server and coming from the server

1792
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:34,400
and from historic data um the an

1793
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,040
analytic tool will be able to measure

1794
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,159
like

1795
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,719
like this particular hours

1796
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,080
traffic amount is much much higher than

1797
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,159
the historic ones

1798
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:45,760
or much much lower than the historic

1799
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:48,879
ones and also

1800
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,360
the delay from the response

1801
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:53,679
compare with the historic data through

1802
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,400
some kind of self-machine learning

1803
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,520
algorithm be able to figure out that

1804
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,559
whether

1805
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,480
the server is overloaded or under loaded

1806
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,719
of course that is all out of the scope

1807
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:08,559
of

1808
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:11,040
this particular working group for idr's

1809
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,159
bgp we just won't be able to carry this

1810
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,080
information

1811
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,199
suppose the router egress router have

1812
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,679
the information

1813
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:20,000
so for load measurement so far we

1814
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:22,639
defined two types of load measurement

1815
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,520
one is the raw measurement the raw

1816
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:26,880
measurement

1817
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:27,440
can be useful for um analytic tool like

1818
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,480
suppose

1819
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,919
there is a little tool um attached to

1820
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:35,120
the raw reflector

1821
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,159
and that need the raw data for future

1822
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:39,679
prediction

1823
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:43,120
um another um matrix to be

1824
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:46,239
propagated is aggregated

1825
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:49,519
index so that suppose all the routers

1826
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:52,080
belonging to belong to same provider

1827
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,440
they can have the same algorithm for

1828
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,920
example here

1829
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,799
kind of waited about all those different

1830
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,280
measurements

1831
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,800
they've added weight together to come up

1832
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:04,159
with the aggregated

1833
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:08,000
load index and this index being

1834
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:10,960
propagated to the ingress router

1835
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,960
next page please

1836
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:23,839
next page yeah i i need a sec here

1837
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:27,280
something went wrong with

1838
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,280
a pdf viewer again

1839
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:36,960
oh sorry okay

1840
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,638
i'm going to unshare my screen and then

1841
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,400
re-share it that

1842
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:42,400
finally is what ended up fixing it last

1843
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:49,840
time

1844
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,840
uh

1845
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,199
okay one more second we'll be back in

1846
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,679
business

1847
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:15,519
so when you're working on this slice i

1848
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,560
just want to mention that there was a

1849
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,520
site meeting

1850
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,320
on the compute first network that is

1851
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,320
assuming that

1852
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,320
application server the computing

1853
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,879
services

1854
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:31,360
can expose the internal logic to the

1855
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,440
network and having the routers

1856
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:35,679
in the network to be aware of the

1857
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,239
computing resource being utilized by

1858
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:40,719
different

1859
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:40,718
app server and be able to forward it um

1860
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:48,719
appropriately so those kind of uh

1861
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:50,320
information can also be carried by uh

1862
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:53,120
those

1863
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:55,599
app metadata path attributes of course

1864
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:56,159
they may introduce some new subtleties

1865
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:59,600
to

1866
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:01,599
indicate the detailed attributes exposed

1867
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,719
by the app server

1868
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,080
so here is the capacity index so the

1869
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,040
capacity index

1870
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:10,880
is just a value which can be configured

1871
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,320
or can be learned through the past

1872
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,800
history

1873
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,679
the preference index is actually

1874
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:18,320
referring to

1875
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,199
specific applications uh application

1876
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:22,159
servers

1877
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:23,199
and that is also can be configured and

1878
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,080
can be

1879
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:27,519
had can have the configured algorithm to

1880
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:30,639
calculate the prefix

1881
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:34,159
preference index

1882
01:25:30,639 --> 01:25:35,679
in the okay next page please um

1883
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:38,719
before i flip would you like to take

1884
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:38,719
ac's question now

1885
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,719
sure you see

1886
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,320
go ahead hey linda i think you need to

1887
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,760
i mean it wouldn't be the only way to

1888
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:49,280
implement it but i think you need to

1889
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,239
specify

1890
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,840
how this forwarding plane like like a

1891
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,000
reference model for this forwarding

1892
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,679
plane that you're envisioning

1893
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
you can't just wave your hand and say

1894
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:04,480
ip6 has a ipv6 says a flow label

1895
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,639
so it and at least at least in one of

1896
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,678
these one of these drafts with all these

1897
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:11,360
uh

1898
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:15,679
metrics you need to have that

1899
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:19,120
with the uh all the anycast

1900
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:21,120
reachable anycast destinations and

1901
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,920
at least one reference on how you would

1902
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:28,800
envision this working because i don't

1903
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:32,239
think anything like this exists today

1904
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:33,360
okay i will add the section on that um

1905
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:37,440
you know what i'm talking about right

1906
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,440
here support flow base forwarding

1907
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:45,599
okay i will add that thank you thank you

1908
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,280
and we have a couple more in the queue

1909
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,480
so uh you want to

1910
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:54,639
keep taking those um

1911
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:57,519
boris please go ahead thank you john

1912
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,400
uh linda one question i'm a bit worried

1913
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:01,760
about

1914
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:04,879
is bgp right like transport or tool

1915
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:08,560
for sending clothes measurement

1916
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:12,560
information because information about

1917
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:17,520
particular load of this aggress node

1918
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:19,520
will be delivered with delay right

1919
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,840
handling delay so it will be information

1920
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:25,280
about load in the past

1921
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:28,960
uh and my concern is about

1922
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:32,159
how actual this information will be

1923
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,960
to make this change okay that's a good

1924
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:35,120
question

1925
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,080
so here we're not talking about um

1926
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,239
transit

1927
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,760
measurement we're talking about historic

1928
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,959
measurement so you are talking about

1929
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,159
like for example

1930
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,800
last 24 hours measurement versus last

1931
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:48,159
one hour

1932
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:51,040
average and or last one month average

1933
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,440
so it's not about very transit so the

1934
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,719
goal

1935
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:56,719
is really to estimate

1936
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,800
the load measurement compared to the

1937
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:00,960
historic data

1938
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,480
so here i'm just not giving the

1939
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,639
specifics on how

1940
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,759
actual measurement could be done it

1941
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,560
could be that

1942
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,800
like in the compute first network the

1943
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:11,520
server themselves being able to expose

1944
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,560
that

1945
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,440
um they could use other information

1946
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,760
maybe genevieve header to be able to

1947
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:22,960
expose the internal

1948
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:27,040
requirement a desire so that is not

1949
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:29,520
specified here here i'm just saying that

1950
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:31,199
when those information becomes available

1951
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,080
need to be propagated

1952
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:35,360
i'll take aces comment and give a

1953
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,600
explanation um

1954
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,199
just assuming certain like a reference

1955
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:42,239
um design like

1956
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:45,280
how this the flow basically will work

1957
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,280
in the next revision

1958
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:52,880
good luck please go ahead

1959
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,600
um i'm guessing you can hear me this

1960
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:58,960
isn't just semantics it's not technical

1961
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,960
but you know you started with saying

1962
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,320
edge compute and i see multiple ip

1963
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:04,000
networks

1964
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,440
you know you know you get to think about

1965
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,520
what qualifies as edge

1966
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,960
you know if you go across multiple isps

1967
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,320
and your way across the line is that

1968
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,080
really an edge compute

1969
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:14,159
so i think it's semantics i i know i

1970
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:16,000
looked at it some pages

1971
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,199
i see where it's edge compute some pages

1972
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,480
i don't know if that could be called

1973
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,839
edge compute so that just for your

1974
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,480
reference as you look at it

1975
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,960
you know if you want to look up that

1976
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,000
i'll

1977
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:29,840
i'll clean up the drive this is the zero

1978
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,840
zero version so thank you

1979
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:38,400
all right let's continue okay so um

1980
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,920
in terms of propagation um of the app

1981
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,519
metadata

1982
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:47,440
we could use the ifc 4684

1983
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:49,440
the rt constraint distribution

1984
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:50,559
only distribute the information to the

1985
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,759
relevant

1986
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:56,880
routers because if you look at

1987
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:59,920
those services like edge servers

1988
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,360
they are not everywhere and

1989
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:06,719
also that not every ingress

1990
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:10,080
or psa would have the user device

1991
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,920
interested in those services so um

1992
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:15,199
the distribution doesn't have to be

1993
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:19,120
broadcast to every router

1994
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:22,239
since um there are many more

1995
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:25,679
much more numbers of edge servers

1996
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:27,519
uh application servers than like rt

1997
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,360
constraint being meant for for the

1998
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:32,080
routers uh we could

1999
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:34,559
another alternative is to create this

2000
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,880
app server bug group um

2001
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:37,920
so this group can be statically

2002
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,960
configured

2003
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,600
um or can be um

2004
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,960
each ingress router can ask for the

2005
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,800
network controller

2006
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:51,840
who are the ones interested

2007
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,719
in this particular service um also

2008
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,600
need a time to live because for any uh

2009
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:59,360
service

2010
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:02,719
um the the time if there's nobody

2011
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:04,400
inside a anchor to this psa is

2012
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:06,719
interested in that service

2013
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:07,440
then that ingress router to the local

2014
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,159
network

2015
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:12,320
that doesn't have to be uh receiving the

2016
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:15,759
information about the specific

2017
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,000
fm app server s1 so those are just about

2018
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,360
the

2019
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,199
scope of the propagation

2020
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,199
i think that's it next page

2021
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:30,639
oh here is about

2022
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:34,239
another unique feature that our

2023
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:36,080
ip network can provide better than the

2024
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:38,400
dns server can do

2025
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,280
we call it software anchoring of any

2026
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,839
cash flow

2027
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,840
next page

2028
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:49,120
so this is referring to um um

2029
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,840
this particular specific requirement by

2030
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:53,040
the

2031
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,719
switchy edge computing so for app server

2032
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:58,080
for example app.net

2033
01:31:54,719 --> 01:32:01,360
right app.net has servers

2034
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,639
located attached to r1 r2

2035
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:08,080
and r3 um what they want to do

2036
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:11,280
is my preferred location

2037
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:15,040
maybe is at r1 like for the

2038
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,880
app server and but if something fail

2039
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:20,719
either server fail

2040
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:23,840
or either the server is overly loaded

2041
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,360
or something happen i want the service

2042
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,400
to go to

2043
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:30,239
e2 or e3 so

2044
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:32,799
in networking we have done a lot of

2045
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:35,839
protection right this is um

2046
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,800
can be achieved by assigning multiple

2047
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,840
addresses

2048
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:42,239
into one app server we can achieve we

2049
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:45,280
call soft anchoring because it's not

2050
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:48,959
specifically anchored to our r1

2051
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,599
or this app server um the way to achieve

2052
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,280
that

2053
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:56,080
is um we create for this app.net will

2054
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:59,360
create a group of anycast addresses

2055
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,120
g4 being the address which not relevant

2056
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:02,159
to the location is not location

2057
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,280
preferred

2058
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:08,400
um l1 address

2059
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:11,759
is preferred to be anchored to r1

2060
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,080
l2 address is preferred to be anchored

2061
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,920
to

2062
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:17,519
r2 l3 address is preferred to be

2063
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:21,120
anchored into r3

2064
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:24,480
so with different cost and the network

2065
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:26,159
can be able to consider all the other

2066
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:30,000
costs like network delay

2067
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:30,638
there could be site capacity index some

2068
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,960
other

2069
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,400
information all consolidated together to

2070
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,880
make the intelligence

2071
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:39,040
decision and when the um like for

2072
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,679
example if it's anchored to r1

2073
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:42,960
if something fail and then they will be

2074
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:47,280
equally distributed

2075
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:50,639
by um r2 or r3 depending on

2076
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:53,440
the other factors so that's uh

2077
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,440
i think the network the ip layer can

2078
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,239
provide a very elegant solution than the

2079
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:58,799
dns

2080
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,799
solution

2081
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:04,799
okay i think that's it

2082
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,560
the background information is about how

2083
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,600
do we just example

2084
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:12,639
algorithm in choosing appropriate

2085
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:18,000
egress router for any cast location

2086
01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:21,600
that um has more discussion in the draft

2087
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:24,639
so just the information here i

2088
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,639
wish we had more

2089
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,320
discussion on the mentalist or from

2090
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:33,839
people here

2091
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:33,840
thank you

2092
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:47,840
please

2093
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,239
um we don't expect to be very dynamic we

2094
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:05,280
expect to be

2095
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:09,599
hours or days um um

2096
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:13,360
those are the average um that that's

2097
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:17,199
that's something we expect or better if

2098
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:18,000
the this provider actually owns those

2099
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:19,440
applications

2100
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,520
then they will be able to give the

2101
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:29,839
information directly and that will be

2102
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:29,840
more accurate

2103
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:40,719
okay so so um if you look at um

2104
01:35:38,159 --> 01:35:42,320
there was a talk at the nanak um a

2105
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:46,000
couple of land ups ago

2106
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:49,040
they talked about using any cash to

2107
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,800
provide for all their services um they

2108
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:53,280
talk about like

2109
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:54,960
they can change the cost they can change

2110
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,199
the peering policy

2111
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,080
but they're talking about in terms of

2112
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:01,280
month

2113
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:03,440
um the traffic pattern can change so

2114
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,880
that's with the manual intervention so

2115
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:08,320
with this approach

2116
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:11,840
um the egress router dynamically measure

2117
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:16,320
the the packets and um the adjustment

2118
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:19,280
can be in hours or minutes

2119
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:21,199
or days much faster than menu uh

2120
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:24,320
reconfiguring the cost

2121
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:27,360
and or reconfiguring the peering to

2122
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:31,280
better balance the the load to

2123
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,280
distribution to the anycast servers

2124
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,840
hello can you hear me

2125
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,280
does it work

2126
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:51,280
okay uh i'm still unclear about to keep

2127
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:54,639
walking

2128
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:55,599
could you clarify uh who is taking the

2129
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:59,040
decision is it

2130
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:01,199
ingress router or do you have a kind of

2131
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,239
intelligent controller which is pushing

2132
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:06,239
to the ingress

2133
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:09,919
via appropriate heart what is your

2134
01:37:06,239 --> 01:37:12,000
decision model here okay so john maybe

2135
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,840
it's easier if you flip to the next page

2136
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:17,760
the background information

2137
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,760
on the sample algorithm um

2138
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:22,320
the main question i have behind is what

2139
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:24,080
is the impact on the existing bgp

2140
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:27,920
decision process

2141
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:31,280
oh so the decision

2142
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:34,159
is made by the ingress router

2143
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:36,320
the ingress router receive all the cost

2144
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:39,119
from different egress routers

2145
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,080
and he had used his own algorithm to

2146
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:42,960
determine

2147
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,320
which egress is the right one for the

2148
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:47,760
particular flow

2149
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:50,559
and yeah yeah but this is bgp

2150
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:51,280
you cannot use your own algorithm you

2151
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,000
have to

2152
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,040
be compliant with the existing bgp

2153
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,440
decision processor

2154
01:37:55,040 --> 01:38:01,760
of course you can specify a new standard

2155
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,799
which is taking into account additional

2156
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,360
parameters

2157
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,360
uh somewhere in the existing decision

2158
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:10,480
process but you cannot simply

2159
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:13,360
uh do something else

2160
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:16,080
well wait wait um let's let's go to the

2161
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:19,119
next page let's go to the maybe second

2162
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:22,960
third page showing that uh the network

2163
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:22,960
structure the first page maybe

2164
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:33,119
oh oh okay yeah yeah this page so

2165
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,080
the the goal of this bgp is to

2166
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:36,639
distribute

2167
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:39,600
the information once the information is

2168
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:42,639
distributed to the ingress router here

2169
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:46,719
and today he used bgp

2170
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:49,760
to choose appropriate egress router

2171
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:51,119
that's all true but in this 5gh

2172
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,840
computing

2173
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:54,719
environment the the ingress router is

2174
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,239
part of the

2175
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:59,040
up upf or psa passion packet session

2176
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:02,320
anchor

2177
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:05,519
and he will not only just use the

2178
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:08,320
network routing as the only criteria

2179
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,119
to choose the egress router he has to

2180
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:13,040
consider

2181
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:15,440
other factors because different

2182
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:16,320
i completely agree with you linda my

2183
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:19,119
point is just

2184
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:20,880
because you are using bgp you have to

2185
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:23,839
comply with bgp

2186
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,719
which means that you cannot simply uh

2187
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:26,880
override

2188
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:28,239
the current decision process you can

2189
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,639
insert

2190
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,519
something into the existing decision

2191
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,920
process but you

2192
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,880
cannot bypass it completely otherwise

2193
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,760
you become

2194
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,880
you have a non-compliant bgp

2195
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,280
implementation

2196
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,520
and if if it's the way you want to do

2197
01:39:41,280 --> 01:39:46,800
simply don't use bgp and

2198
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:50,480
and and write your own protocol

2199
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:53,360
that's also fine but my point is just

2200
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:54,559
if you use bgp you can enhance the

2201
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:57,920
existing

2202
01:39:54,560 --> 01:40:01,280
decision process by taking into account

2203
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:05,040
your delay preference capacity index or

2204
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:07,440
or whatever but this should fit into the

2205
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:12,159
existing decision process

2206
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:12,159
and the question also is

2207
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:15,440
if you want to do that another way could

2208
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:19,119
be to

2209
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:20,000
compute your cost at egress and use the

2210
01:40:19,119 --> 01:40:23,920
existing

2211
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,320
cost attribute in bgp to carry it

2212
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:28,000
that could be another way to do it but

2213
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,559
the problem with that way we have

2214
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,040
because

2215
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,760
in the draft we did document that way

2216
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:35,519
okay

2217
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:38,639
um so the problem with that way is

2218
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:41,199
first of all then all the algorithm all

2219
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:45,360
the egress router has to be consistent

2220
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:48,559
second the you cannot differentiate

2221
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:52,000
which user which input side come from

2222
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:55,520
because as an ingress router he

2223
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:58,159
may need to have other informations

2224
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,840
in addition to the egress route running

2225
01:40:58,159 --> 01:41:03,599
status

2226
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:06,719
in addition to this cost matrix from r1

2227
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:09,920
it may need other factors uh to choose

2228
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:11,679
because for example in this uh um our

2229
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,159
for example let's just talk about the

2230
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:17,679
router b right but rather b

2231
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:20,400
when he has the ue traffic coming to s1

2232
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:21,840
if it's original ue he would choose the

2233
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,599
s1

2234
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,679
closest to him based on the routing

2235
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:28,639
distance or other conflict

2236
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:30,320
matrix but there's when there's a ue1

2237
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:33,600
coming from

2238
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:37,280
5g side a re-anchored to

2239
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,000
psa2 then this particular flow

2240
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:41,599
need to go to prefer to stick to the

2241
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,040
original server

2242
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:47,119
okay so based on the source he may need

2243
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:49,519
to forward it to a different server

2244
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,559
and maybe using a tunneling or maybe use

2245
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,040
the sr

2246
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:54,320
technology to forward to send it to the

2247
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:56,400
egress r1

2248
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:58,639
so the decision point should be

2249
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:01,360
considered that

2250
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:02,239
that not only just the matrix themselves

2251
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:05,040
the the

2252
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:07,599
computer cost the other factors to be

2253
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:11,280
considered

2254
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:14,239
fair enough but again if you are

2255
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:15,360
trying to modify the decision process

2256
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:18,559
you have to comply

2257
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:22,000
with the existing bgp decision process

2258
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:23,679
and try to fit your additional inputs

2259
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:26,560
into the existing decision process

2260
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:30,320
that's my comment okay okay well take

2261
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:30,320
that into consideration thank you very

2262
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,600
much

2263
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:46,400
yeah i heard the comment about hours

2264
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:48,239
linda

2265
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:50,719
i wouldn't make a blanket i wouldn't

2266
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:52,718
make a blanket say but about hours

2267
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:54,159
think about you know 5g is not one use

2268
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:56,560
case and you've got

2269
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:58,000
consumer you have enterprise and you

2270
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:00,400
have critical services

2271
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
you have some other stuff so if don't

2272
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,119
build your solution out that the

2273
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,800
you know the measurement is going to be

2274
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:05,920
in hours because in some use cases that

2275
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,719
won't be helpful so

2276
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:12,159
just keep that in mind oh thank you very

2277
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,159
much that's a very good input

2278
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:25,840
thank you

2279
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:37,440
okay next one so this is about sd1

2280
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:39,040
totally different subject um okay so

2281
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:44,719
this is about sql edge

2282
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:44,719
discovery using bgp um next page please

2283
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:54,800
um so the intention of the draft

2284
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:57,839
is to use the tunnel in cab

2285
01:43:54,800 --> 01:44:00,239
20 and using the recursive lookup

2286
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,119
and to tag the client routes with

2287
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:04,320
extended

2288
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:05,519
community and also with the color

2289
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,519
extended community

2290
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:12,159
to make the update more compact

2291
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,159
next page

2292
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:19,199
so the the recursive lookup is described

2293
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:22,799
in the tunneling cap section

2294
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:26,638
8 so the client route

2295
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:30,800
basically have the next hop to the

2296
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:33,119
edge node loopback address then with

2297
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:34,000
instead of describing all the detailed

2298
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:36,880
tunnel attributes

2299
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,880
for this reaching this client which is

2300
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,159
using the encapsulation extended

2301
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,639
community

2302
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:43,599
with the tunnel type we want to have a

2303
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:47,040
new tunnel type

2304
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:48,320
sd1 hybrid or other existing tunnel

2305
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:51,519
types

2306
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:54,960
and we color it with a specific color

2307
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:58,080
extender community and then the

2308
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:00,960
update 2 for the node

2309
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,960
will have the

2310
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:06,159
tunnel egress endpoint to describe which

2311
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:09,040
endpoint which port this

2312
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:09,839
tunnel ends terminate and we'll have the

2313
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:13,440
port

2314
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:14,560
uh subtly which include the isp

2315
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:17,759
information

2316
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:20,400
for this particular one port

2317
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,600
like whether it's from uh company a or

2318
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:24,799
company b

2319
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,440
um would include geolocation of this

2320
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,719
node

2321
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:29,759
just assume that when sd1 deployment

2322
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,400
they can be

2323
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,080
far apart in different countries or

2324
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:37,839
different states

2325
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:39,679
the lisp has this septual v geo location

2326
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:40,880
which is can be very useful to be

2327
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,239
included

2328
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,960
and also optionally to include all the

2329
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,919
ipsec

2330
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,760
sub tods um episode some theory can be

2331
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:53,119
tricky because episode

2332
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:55,760
security associations are pairwise

2333
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:58,000
meaning every node between two every

2334
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:01,199
node they have different keys

2335
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,040
so the the attributes as defined in the

2336
01:46:01,199 --> 01:46:05,440
secure evpn you can see is

2337
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:06,960
um there are many of course they can be

2338
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:11,280
included

2339
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:13,920
but also we could include security essay

2340
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:15,119
identifiers which is pre-configured as

2341
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:17,760
well

2342
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:17,759
next page

2343
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:25,840
next page so here is the

2344
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:26,718
just illustration of the recursive

2345
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,920
lookup

2346
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:34,000
um so you have um

2347
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:37,119
this example cpe2 has client routes 10.

2348
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,840
20. something 3.1.1x

2349
01:46:37,119 --> 01:46:46,080
so um for the prefix 10.1.1x

2350
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:47,679
and 20.1.1x uh their next hub is 222

2351
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:52,080
which is cp2

2352
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:54,560
and they are colored um with red

2353
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,760
and it shows that they are hybrid

2354
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:59,440
meaning that

2355
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:01,920
those rounds can be carried by um l3 vpn

2356
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:05,360
pass terminated at the cpe2

2357
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:09,679
and also being terminated like we have a

2358
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:13,559
one port provided by isp1 192 port

2359
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:18,000
and another port provided by the

2360
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:20,800
isp2 or you could be terminated by

2361
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,159
the loopback address ipsec terminated at

2362
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,320
the loopback address

2363
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:27,280
so either of them will be fine but here

2364
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:29,920
we don't have to specify that

2365
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,920
next page

2366
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:40,639
here is um update 2

2367
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:43,040
which describes the detailed attributes

2368
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:44,800
so one way to do it actually with this

2369
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:48,239
present at the bath

2370
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:51,360
yesterday we're just using the

2371
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:51,759
tunneling attributes with the new tunnel

2372
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,119
type

2373
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:58,639
sd1 hybrid which can include all the

2374
01:47:55,119 --> 01:48:01,759
needed information um and

2375
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:04,560
you will have the color

2376
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,440
you will have the detailed endpoint

2377
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:08,800
subtle

2378
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:12,559
you will have the ip sub tovs or

2379
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:13,119
ipsec sa ids that's that's one way to do

2380
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:16,159
it

2381
01:48:13,119 --> 01:48:16,880
um but more optimized way we'll be able

2382
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:20,879
to

2383
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:23,360
is to create a new savvy sd17

2384
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:24,560
which has the color um which are

2385
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:27,679
applicable to

2386
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:31,199
all the um tunnel attributes

2387
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:32,400
carried by this update just make the

2388
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:35,919
update

2389
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:39,599
more compact um also you can have

2390
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:41,520
like if there's a specific tunnel um

2391
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:44,480
be colored differently like purple for

2392
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:47,520
example only goes to cpu3

2393
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,280
you can use this tunnel uh you can use

2394
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:52,320
the color subtly

2395
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:54,719
to further identify the specific

2396
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,719
tunnel

2397
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:04,320
next page

2398
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:08,560
um so this is for the um sd1

2399
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:11,599
um hybrid uh hyper s1 hybrid tunnel type

2400
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:13,760
um you can um here are the introdu um

2401
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:16,480
you can include multiple underlay

2402
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:20,639
tunnels included in this

2403
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:23,440
you can have a list of episode essays

2404
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,840
you can have all those essay terminated

2405
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,638
at

2406
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:32,080
one endpoint um

2407
01:49:28,639 --> 01:49:35,360
endpoint egress endpoint subtle

2408
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:39,280
and all those ports all those ipsec

2409
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:42,400
essays share the common port

2410
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:45,360
information um

2411
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:45,360
next page please

2412
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:53,679
alternatively the episode attributes can

2413
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,719
be included

2414
01:49:53,679 --> 01:50:00,080
include the ipsec essays nouns

2415
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:02,960
public keys you include the transform

2416
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,760
substructures and those have detailed

2417
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,880
description

2418
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:09,199
in the secure ebt pm though

2419
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,560
all those attributes can be included

2420
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:14,159
under the

2421
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:16,480
hybrid sd1 in addition to existing

2422
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:21,199
tunnels like for example

2423
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:23,759
you may have mgie or you may have ip

2424
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:26,480
all those can be included underneath

2425
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:29,520
this tunnel type

2426
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,519
next page please

2427
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:36,879
so with the sd-wan survey just to make

2428
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:40,080
the implementation easier

2429
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:43,280
when the receiver received the update

2430
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:46,239
um the color hd1 color will be

2431
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,800
applicable to all the um paths all the

2432
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:51,199
tunnels

2433
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:55,119
attached in this update just like sr's

2434
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:57,598
color and

2435
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:58,960
here here are the detailed information

2436
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:02,880
underneath

2437
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:02,880
the hybrid sd1 tunnel type

2438
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:11,440
next page

2439
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:15,119
um for the savvy um sd1 sappy

2440
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:18,320
um we'll have two two types

2441
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:22,000
one is assuming that

2442
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:23,040
sd1 deployment is managed by one single

2443
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,400
company

2444
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:30,080
or all their locators can be

2445
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:33,280
represented by a local significant

2446
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:36,480
identifier another type

2447
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:40,400
is for a large deployment where you

2448
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:42,559
would require the geo geolocation

2449
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:45,598
sub-glv to be included

2450
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:49,199
to uniquely identify the location

2451
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:52,639
the geolocations sub tov is

2452
01:51:49,199 --> 01:51:55,919
from the lisp geolocation draft

2453
01:51:52,639 --> 01:51:59,520
um you have a local id port

2454
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:02,719
id like suppose that you may have

2455
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,920
a group of cpes there they may have a

2456
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,239
local significant

2457
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:06,960
number to represent different port

2458
01:52:06,239 --> 01:52:09,280
number

2459
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,239
so that's has a local id and then you

2460
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,559
have a coloring

2461
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:13,678
which represents the common properties

2462
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,679
shared by all the

2463
01:52:13,679 --> 01:52:20,639
tunnel attributes

2464
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,639
next page please

2465
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:27,199
so that's it we would like to hear your

2466
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:27,199
feedback

2467
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:35,119
and in the draft the more detailed

2468
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,119
description on the encoding of the

2469
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:43,280
nouns and essays

2470
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:45,760
and transform so that is more details

2471
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:48,080
i don't think we need to talk about them

2472
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,080
here

2473
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,480
okay well we want your feedback so

2474
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,920
anybody want to add themselves to the

2475
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:58,080
queue or

2476
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:59,920
is it too late at night early in the

2477
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:03,280
morning to

2478
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:07,360
dial into details about ipsec

2479
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:07,360
that's where my brain is right now

2480
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:16,400
linda thank you um seeing the queue

2481
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:19,360
empty i think that it's time for us to

2482
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:21,839
call it a night slash morning slash

2483
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,839
afternoon

2484
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:31,119
