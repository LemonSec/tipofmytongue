for 30 minutes and these are the two

91
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,520
items that we need to dispatch today

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
then we have the signature validation

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,359
token

94
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,638
svt update stefan and i just want to

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,199
remind that this is not a topic to

96
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
actually dispatch this was dispatch at

97
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,560
atf 107

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,360
but since this was since we had time

99
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,880
today

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,000
and this uh we requested some time

101
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,560
um this was requesting some time we

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,520
added it to the agenda

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,479
um yeah i see that stefan is in the

104
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,560
queue

105
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
so go ahead stephan

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,440
sorry i i completely misunderstood that

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,400
uh

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,080
intention tension for participating with

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
this presentation today

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,359
was that it should be dispatched today

111
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,360
because

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
what we did last time was make a

113
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,560
presentation but we never dispatched it

114
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,280
we decided to create a a email

115
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
list that we never created so this is

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,318
the time where

117
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
i would expect this item to be

118
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,960
dispatched

119
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,840
we did discuss it and dispatched it in

120
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
an appropriate way which was create a

121
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,840
main list to get to see if there was

122
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,840
interest to move it in forward

123
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,680
and according to the charter um

124
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,599
once items are dispatched they should

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,400
not be brought back obviously unless

126
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,199
there is some substantial changes

127
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,719
um which i think there is so could we

128
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,000
could we at least have the discussion

129
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,280
and then decide whether

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,080
we want to dispatch it so this is

131
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,198
kathleen

132
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,719
um the list being not being created was

133
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
probably a backlog

134
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,520
item so i'm assuming perhaps

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
it just didn't get done for

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,039
administrative reasons not for any

137
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,440
purpose so we do plan to have the

138
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,479
discussion but as francesca said it was

139
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,160
dispatched

140
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,159
um so let's make sure a list does get

141
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,720
created this time so stefan will need

142
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
your help on that and then the ads as

143
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
well

144
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,359
might be to put this actually in a

145
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
working group because we think it fits

146
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,319
there and then it would be unnecessary

147
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,080
to create a

148
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,000
a a list because it would be better to

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,000
discuss it in the working group where it

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
could be dispatched or is it completely

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
impossible

152
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,000
to add a working item to a working group

153
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
if it has ever been discussed in the

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,400
second dispatch

155
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,679
no no that's not then impossible but

156
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
let's let's hear from

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,520
our ad ben go ahead yeah i mean the the

158
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,280
short summary here is that yes we did

159
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,198
attempt to dispatch it to an emailing

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,799
list and the list didn't get created and

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
that's just because the 80s didn't

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,280
follow up

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
and we didn't get a reminder about it so

164
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,479
uh in order to create a list we need

165
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
a few pieces of information some of

166
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,199
those we can't actually guess

167
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,239
ourselves so stefan if you could please

168
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,599
follow up with us after the session

169
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
we can get you the list of pieces of

170
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,840
information that we need to create the

171
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,599
list

172
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,359
there's no problem creating a list and

173
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,080
then later wanting to create a working

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,639
group

175
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,680
we can reuse the same list if that is

176
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,720
appropriate

177
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
so i think the best path is to get the

178
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
list

179
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,120
and then um if we have interest

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,240
and we want to turn it into working

181
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
group we can

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,599
proceed using that list as well

183
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
we can take it later but the the idea

184
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
was not to create a new working group

185
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,040
but to fit it into one of the existing

186
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,760
working groups

187
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,599
oh i misheard yours in that case it

188
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,600
would be unnecessary to create a mailing

189
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,000
because that was my only point

190
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,000
i see we can talk it later take it later

191
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,160
okay but uh yeah let's take it later and

192
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
continue this

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,680
discussion during the time slot we'll

194
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
have time anyway

195
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,399
um yeah 25 minutes open mic

196
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,600
and then conclusion by the chairs

197
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,440
uh so release patch process this is just

198
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
a reminder for everybody

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
that the sect dispatch recommends the

200
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,640
next steps for new work it does not

201
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
adopt drafts or does the technical work

202
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,760
in the working group

203
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,320
so possible outcomes of this patch of

204
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
this

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,040
session today will be to direct the

206
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,680
document to an existing working group

207
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,640
propose a new focused working group ad

208
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
sponsorship

209
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,760
assuming ada is willing additional

210
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,880
discussion

211
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,959
or community development is required and

212
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
itf should not work on this topic those

213
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,518
are all valid

214
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,040
dispatching and just

215
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,519
to to uh underline

216
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,640
uh or to to go back one second to to the

217
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,839
previous document

218
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,640
um i i think that the dispatching

219
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,920
uh outcome last time this document was

220
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
discussed was

221
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
an additional discussion community

222
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
development was required

223
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,319
um but let's take it later so we can

224
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,319
move on

225
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,360
so um just a quick

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,360
run through the the uh participation

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,040
guidelines when you're at the microphone

228
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
please state your name before speaking

229
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,199
if you can remember

230
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,160
it helps with the minutes taking and

231
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,279
also for the recording

232
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,839
and keep the dispatch question in mind

233
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,120
so it's great to have comments and

234
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
feedback about

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,279
content but please try to keep it

236
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,480
constructive and also

237
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,360
give advice on where you think this work

238
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
should go if

239
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,880
it should go anywhere and keep your

240
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,519
comments

241
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,040
quick if you can two three minutes we

242
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
have more times today so we're less

243
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,240
strict about that

244
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,959
uh to speak you'll have to

245
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
join the queue which is the hand icon

246
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,279
and then

247
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,839
once you're given the floor you can send

248
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,480
audio and video if you want

249
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,720
and then there is other controls such as

250
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
show hand which i'm not sure we will use

251
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,360
today and the chat

252
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,040
which is synced with jabber as i said

253
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,519
and yes one slide for show of hand

254
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:34,880
but we can move on to the first

255
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,880
topic to dispatch which is thomas

256
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,839

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,199
for the opportunity

264
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
i think the goal of this presentation is

265
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,959
just to make uh folks aware of this

266
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
um you know ongoing effort and to invite

267
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
people to

268
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
to participate so so this is just the

269
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,638
the outline

270
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,560
um of the presentation um i prefer to

271
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399

everybody knows what's in scope and what

273
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
what is our scope

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
and then uh you know if you if anyone

275

questions uh next slide please

281
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,639
francesca

282
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
so so what's the what's the problem

283
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,120
statement you know for

284
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,800
uh folks who are following the whole

285
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,200
you know uh blockchain uh dlt discussion

286
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
narrative uh and for folks who are

287
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,120
following

288
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
the discussion about you know

289
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,639
decentralized finance and d5

290
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,800
it's it's very clear that that um

291
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,839
you know um the industry is still in the

292
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
nascent state

293
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,839
we have very poor interoperability

294
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,120
between a systems

295
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,440
and um right now if you want to do

296
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,519
um you know asset transfers virtual

297
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
asset and i'm using the word

298
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,560
sort of generically you typically have

299
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,600
to

300
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,680
ask uh help from a third

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,120
party entity which is in the industry

302
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,479
typically called you know crypto

303
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
exchanges and

304
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,399
in the united states there's about i

305
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,359
don't know between 25

306
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
to 30 crypto exchanges some of them are

307
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,079
well known you know

308
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,839
uh kraken um a base and so on

309
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,160
and so the the problem there is in fact

310
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,680
the the crypto exchanges themselves

311
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,959
become a centralization point

312
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,319
becomes a choke uh point and it

313
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,199
in fact goes it goes against the whole

314
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
um sort of ethos of this this

315
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,319
decentralization

316
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,160
and autonomy right if if you're

317
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
dependent on a third party to do

318
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,839
anything outside your system well

319
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,760
you know you're kind of you're kind of

320
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,519
um you know constrained

321
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
you're not really you know autonomous

322
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,959
and in some cases it could lead to asset

323
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,040
lockets so for those who

324
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,880
uh paid attention to the cryptokitties

325
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,399
incident it pretty much

326
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,360
you know put ethereum at a at a halt

327
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
which means if if you had assets there

328
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,760
that have nothing

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to do with with cryptokitty and you're

330
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,680
trying to exchange it you you know

331
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
you're you're impacted

332
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,239
you know by that um next slide

333
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,240
please francesca

334
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,719
so this is a quick quick diagram for

335
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,720
those you know we don't know you know

336
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,399
i i like to use visuals you know being

337
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,120
an engineer so this is kind of what it

338
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
looks like

339
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
there's an exchange entity in in the

340
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,839
middle

341
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,839
um next slide please uh franciscan

342
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,279
and so what we think we need is a

343
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,599
specific model between two dlt systems

344
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,199
based on on gateways so we need you know

345
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,680
standardized protocol

346
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,000
the protocol needs to be agnostic to the

347
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,758
economic value and and right now if you

348
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,600
read a lot of the literature there is a

349
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
lot of confusion between

350
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
you know the notion of economic value

351
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
and in fact some people are now

352
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,560
even questioning you know what is

353
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,959
economic value like you know

354
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,880
uh and so these gateways uh stand in

355
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,518
front of their uh dlt system

356
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
each dlp may have multiple gateways so

357
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
these

358
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,319
these questions that we need to answer

359
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,199
such as you know how do you pair up

360
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
a gateway how does a dlt system elect or

361
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,399
select

362
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,519
a given gateway you know to talk to

363
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
another gateway

364
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
and i just noticed there's a typo there

365
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,040
uh the second gateway should read

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
up g2 not not both g1 so it's g1 and g2

367
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
my

368
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,639
my apologies uh next slide please

369
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,199
please francesca so so this is kind of

370
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
what

371
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,000
we are looking at the model here is that

372
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,000
you have gateway g1 and g2

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,160
um there is the protocol in the middle

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
we call it generically the gateway

375
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,560
protocol but we actually have a draft

376
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,920
that the

377
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,040
uh open digital asset uh protocol or

378
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,160
odap

379
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,199
um and this is uh this is draft

380
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,040
hargraves you know dash odap if you just

381
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,160
uh google that

382
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,839
and um the the model assumes that on

383
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
both sides there are resources

384
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
instead of talking about blockchains or

385
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,399
dlps we just talk about

386
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,279
resources there are interior resources

387
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,240
to a dlt system and there are exterior

388
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,560
resources the interior resources uh

389
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,519
whatever the dlp is using it could be

390
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,479
its own ledger it could be the public

391
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
keys

392
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,400
uh it could be you know consensus

393
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,439
protocol if you want to call that a

394
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
resource

395
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,600
uh and there are things outside any dlt

396
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,959
which are off chain

397
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,719
resources what we've been calling

398
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,839
exterior resources and those are things

399
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,799
like

400
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,319
um you know asset depositories that can

401
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,879
actually perform validation

402
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,000
of the true nature of an asset so one of

403
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,600
one of the problems

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,080
today is that there's no definitive um

405
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,719
you know entity authority that says well

406
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,639
okay

407
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,919
this this is a stable coin that's coming

408
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
out of this group so

409
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
so so you know even even in if you guys

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,760
are following the whole

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,280
libra thing libra version two which is

412
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,600
actually a stable coin

413
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,440
question becomes uh what is the legal

414
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,080
status of the organization when they

415
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,640
they

416
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,639
proclaim that this is a stable coin com

417
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,720
coming out of liberal right so

418
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
that that's kind of out of scope but but

419
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
let's say for example in this discussion

420
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,600
you know the client wants to you know

421
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,799
affect the

422
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,520
transfer across g1 and g2 well g2 and g1

423
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,918
need

424
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,240
to understand that they're talking about

425
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,320
about that very specific

426
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,880
you know uh asset and and there's no

427
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,039
there's no you know discrepancy right so

428
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
so we'll we'll talk about that later on

429
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,520
um uh

430
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,199
but but this is this is the model and

431
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,639
the scope of work for the itf is

432
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,559
is that in the middle legs g1 and g2

433
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
uh what what happens in between what

434
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,039
what does g1 and g2 need to have in

435
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,559
terms of capabilities in order to

436
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:35,120
perform a unidirectional transfer

437
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,120
next slide please francesca

438
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,559
so so this is this is in a single long

439
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,880
sentence what is what is it

440
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,639
that you want to develop so so it's it's

441
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,160
a gateway to gateway protocol that

442
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,280
allows the secure transfer

443
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,600
of a uh digital asset representation so

444
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
just

445
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,399
put it that way we can we can we can

446
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
talk about you know what's the

447
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,039
definition of a virtual asset

448
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,440
it's unidirectional so we want to focus

449
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,480
just on just a one-way unidirectional

450
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
transfer

451
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,000
and get that working because i know

452
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,918
there's a lot of interest in industry

453
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,600
with a thing called atomic swaps if you

454
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,840
guys know what that is

455
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,080
which is a this is a dependent you know

456
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,399
uh two two directional transfer

457
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,918
um uh and there's some issues there you

458
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,440
know if you guys know what the hash lock

459
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,320
and the time lock is and there's a lot

460
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,160
of issues there

461
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,600
so you know what we want to do is just

462
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,200
do one direction

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,360
and make that a building block because

464
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
if you can get that working

465
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,479
you can do bi-directional with

466
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,639
conditionals

467
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,600
using the unit directional as a building

468
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,840
block

469
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,799
it needs to satisfy some requirements

470
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,199
and that's in the

471
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,918
architecture drive now basically

472
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,799
requirements

473
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,840
relating to atomicity you know the acid

474
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,080
properties

475
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,199
and the non-repudiation meaning that if

476
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,039
anything happens

477
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,720
there's a crash or there's some kind of

478
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,760
an attempt to cheat

479
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,160
then both g1 and g2 have sufficient

480
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,600
evidence for uh you know if they have to

481
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,760
um

482
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,158
you know argue and they have to um you

483
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,240
know dispute you know the transaction

484
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,640
it needs to be agnostic to the higher

485
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,960
level economic value so so this is

486
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,799
uh this is actually very much like the

487
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,039
end-to-end principle where

488
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
you know the the as well knowing being

489
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,799
the itf the the

490
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,158
ip network is agnostic to whether or not

491
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,280
the the datagram

492
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,440
is um is a you know a video

493
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,399
uh you know part of video or part of you

494
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,440
know a voice

495
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:34,240
or part of something else and

496
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:37,440
next slide please franciscan

497
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:40,400
so so what's what what do we see as

498
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,679
uh items in our work in scope of work so

499
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,080
we want to define

500
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,919
the apis of both ends of the gateway so

501
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,120
and right now we're focusing on wrestle

502
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,880
apis though

503
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,639
if we do this correctly then you know

504
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
somebody can you know if they want to

505
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,760
implement it using

506
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,639
you know a you know uh state full

507
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,320
um sort of messaging in a protocol you

508
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,159
could do that as well but but

509
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,158
that's what we want to you know focus on

510
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,600
today we're going to define the resource

511
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,640
identifier so that

512
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,280
g1 and g2 can be pointing to the the

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,760
same things using the same identifiers

514
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,600
uh we want to define the message flows

515
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,080
and of course the payloads that go into

516
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
that that

517
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,678
message and also a set of commands you

518
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,399
know that that

519
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,799
some of the messages are in fact you

520
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,880
know

521
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,720
uh you know affecting commands to

522
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,919
between g1 and g2

523
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,440
um secure channel establishment we we

524
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,120
want to use whatever is

525
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,480
you know available today if it's you

526
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
know jealous 1.3

527
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,799
you know great um you know that we don't

528
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,918
want to do anything new there

529
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,639
we might extend the terminology of uh

530
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,080
the nist

531
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
mr mr80202 which is actually a great

532
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,360
document if

533
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,480
if you want to you know point anybody to

534
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,799
a

535
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
sort of reference document about

536
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,080
terminology because

537
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,159
there's so many there's so many so much

538
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,480
confusion in terms of terminology in

539
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,200
in this space i would recommend looking

540
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
at that

541
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,760
nist document uh next slide

542
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,760
please francesca

543
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,720
so all this is out of scope so we are

544
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,480
not going to deal with

545
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,919
blockchains and dlt systems they're not

546
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,000
going to propose anything

547
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
anything new in blockchains and dlps

548
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,720
we're not going to focus on consensus

549
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,840
and vfd protocols i know there's a lot

550
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,080
of interest in

551
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,280
proof of stake proof of work uh and so

552
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,960
on uh

553
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,799
we're not gonna do cryptocurrencies and

554
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,159
tokenization and i know some of you

555
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,799
might be saying oh just

556
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
you know if if itf we just issue its

557
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,639
cryptocurrency we can all be rich but

558
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,600
unfortunately we're not gonna do that in

559
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,919
this

560
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
effort uh so we're not gonna talk about

561
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,440
incentive mechanisms

562
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,799
zero knowledge protocols another hot

563
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
topic

564
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,158
um so authentication authorization we

565
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
will use

566
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,280
whatever has been standardized so there

567
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
are some cases where

568
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,520
we think for say a private dlp system

569
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,360
that in order to access uh

570
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,918
the the resources uh interior resources

571
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,399
in fact

572
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,440
also in fact the the exterior resources

573
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
that the query

574
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,799
needs to have some kind of authorization

575
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,000
well if it uses

576
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
you know oauth or gnab great let's just

577
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
use

578
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,600
oauth we're not going to invent anything

579
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,280
new there

580
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
we're not going to do any concurrency

581
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,799
control algorithms

582
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,158
uh if you look at the architecture draft

583
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,400
we're just taking

584
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,200
uh the two-phase commit or three-phase

585
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
commit as

586
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
sort of the basis it's it's 30 years old

587
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,679
35 years

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,679
old um from jim gray back in 78 79

589
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,280
it's well studied well known implemented

590
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,919
everywhere if you have any

591
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,158
kind of database in your organization

592
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,640
probably has to face commit

593
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,640
identity management so identity might be

594
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,200
needed again that's out of scope for us

595
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,320
and identity privacy data privacy is out

596
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,919
of scope for us

597
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,158
and the list goes on if you have any

598
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,799
questions you know of whether or not

599
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,880
something is

600
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,000
in scope you know just send it to the

601
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,039
mailing list and

602
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,720
um you know somebody will answer or

603
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:11,120
i can answer it if no one answers

604
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,120
next slide please um francesca

605
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,600
so so um some desirable features well it

606
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,120
must work if one or both of the dlps are

607
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,399
private right so this is one of the

608
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,918
the key issues today is that that um we

609
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,799
cannot assume that the world in the

610
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,279
future will

611
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,559
consist of one gigantic you know

612
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,679
permissionless public

613
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,600
uh blockchain um or dlp it's

614
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
that's not how the world works in fact

615
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,120
there are already private

616
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,320
dlt systems running today if you just

617
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,840
google the

618
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,399
jpmorgan you know coin jpmt coin you'll

619
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,760
see that

620
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,320
the the monetary authority of singapore

621
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
is already running you know uh internal

622
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,240
tests on on a private

623
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,080
you know blockchain dlp so and and

624
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
that's how it is the geopolitical issues

625
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,799
right so

626
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,120
so for those who are following the the

627
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,240
central bank issued currency cbdc's

628
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,639
you'll understand that

629
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
that that's a very complicated

630
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
geopolitically

631
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,760
loaded issue and so um you know

632
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,320
uh you know we need we need to we need

633
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
to

634
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,918
be ready for the case where the world

635
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,840
has you know private dlts

636
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,840
it must work with one side as a legacy

637
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,360
system so for example if you look at g1

638
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,279
and g2

639
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,158
we have to be ready we have to design it

640
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,159
so that maybe behind g2 is not a dlp

641
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,039
it's a legacy system it's just a

642
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,840
monolithic you know computer system uh

643
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,840
well g1

644
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,279
really shouldn't care about that and and

645
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,158
vice versa right so that

646
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
the the interior the complexity of each

647
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,200
of the

648
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,400
dlts or systems behind the gateway

649
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,440
really needs to be

650
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
hidden away so that it doesn't uh you

651
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,120
know uh

652
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,600
influence the the design of the protocol

653
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,559
it it must result in atomic settlement

654
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,879
with sufficient

655
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,559
evidence i've mentioned that before and

656
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
it needs to support different client

657
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
modes

658
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,120
so in the odap draft you'll see there's

659
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,000
three different modes and

660
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,320
we think that pretty much covers you

661
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
know

662
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,399
most of the types of interaction between

663
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,720
the client and and the gateway

664
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
right and so you know we can we can

665
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
discuss that

666
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,678
you know later on if there's time or you

667
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,039
know if you have any questions about

668
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
that you know throw it on the mailing

669
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,480
list

670
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,120
and and and martin or myself or luke uh

671
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,159
you know

672
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:29,439
uh we'll answer that um

673
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,440
next uh slide please um francesca

674
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,600
uh just the uh throw this out so that

675
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,679
you know um

676
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,000
people know what we're referring to when

677
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,799
we say atomicity so we want the

678
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,559
acid properties to hold true when we do

679
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,520
a unidirectional transfer so that means

680
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,080
in terms of

681
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,799
of the actual asset um if there's any

682
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,279
failure

683
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
you know before the commit then you know

684
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,600
the transaction needs to commit

685
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,559
or completely fail so so that means in

686
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,240
terms of

687
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,918
uh the the effect on the asset the asset

688
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
must not change in terms of its

689
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,840
ownership

690
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,480
uh needs consistency so so you know a

691
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,639
transfer

692
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
you know must always result in the asset

693
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,159
being in one dlt only

694
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,760
right so you can't have you know

695
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,320
duplicates um

696
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,440
isolation while the transfer is

697
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,200
occurring

698
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,200
you know you you shouldn't be able to

699
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,919
change the the assets so so

700
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,880
let me explain so if if alice in you

701
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,000
know glt-1

702
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,480
is trying to send to bob in the lt2

703
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,799
while an analysis initiated transaction

704
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,120
and a gateway is processing it

705
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,799
that asset needs to be made unavailable

706
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,639
to alice so that alice doesn't

707
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,840
use it for another local transaction

708
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,440
effectively doing

709
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,199
a double spend so in fact we want we

710
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,320
want the no double spend

711
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,480
rule to hold um during an asset transfer

712
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,399
uh durability so this is a this is a big

713
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,120
issue and and we've had discussions on

714
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,399
this

715
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,158
um once once you reach the last stage of

716
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,120
the two phase commit which is the commit

717
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,679
final

718
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,678
um you know and and that means both

719
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,200
sides you and you two have agreed

720
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,919
uh to commit uh if one of them crashes

721
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,559
then you know it it needs to hold right

722
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,600
that that

723
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,760
that the the commitment is final um

724
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,120
and so this brings a whole lot of

725
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,679
questions about what

726
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,879
you know even before we reach that phase

727
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,039
what happens if

728
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,200
if one of the gateways crashes right so

729
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,000
so this this entire question of gateway

730
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,919
crashes

731
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,080
is a very important one and you know

732
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,440
we've got um you know discussions going

733
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,840
about that

734
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
uh next slide please francesca

735
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,520
uh so propose deliverable so so um

736
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,520
uh so so um

737
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
why am i watching intro so that's not my

738
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,760
slide

739
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,760
no let me just uh yeah i

740
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,520
i i know that i know the ripple guys and

741
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,879
i know i know in the intelligent

742
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,879
project um so so the deliverables let me

743
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,919
just continue while francesca is talking

744
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,960
um

745
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,679
so so uh i'm of the mind that i think

746
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,799
a good working group has very specific

747
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,840
deliverables

748
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:13,120
very well-defined possibly narrow

749
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,520
scope and you know a well-defined you

750
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,000
know

751
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,200
timeline so so so our proposed

752
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,279
deliverables are

753
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,320
um architecture specification

754
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,039
architecture draft

755
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,720
uh the protocol draft and the use cases

756
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,360
rough and we have that

757
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,120
up on the data tracker you know loaded

758
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,120
optional again we don't want to over

759
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,639
commit over promise

760
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,559
you know two additional possible work

761
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,760
items would be an asset profile

762
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,600
json specification so so it's basically

763
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,640
you know given an asset profile

764
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,918
if you guys know who the dtcc is in new

765
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,240
york it's the

766
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,760
it's the certificates depository so if

767
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,840
you you know if you own

768
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,760
you know assets do whatever you know

769
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,520
real estate in new york

770
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,760
that she's a paper you may not want to

771
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,000
hold it you know you deposit it

772
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,279
in the safes of the dtcc and and they

773
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,880
make a statement but

774
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,000
but uh in order for g1 and g2 to be able

775
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,480
to refer and talk

776
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
about the same asset there needs to be a

777
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,320
standard

778
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,320
on like a json you know representation

779
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,000
of that asset so it needs to have

780
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,520
you know the issuer name what's the

781
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,679
asset code name

782
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,039
is there any denomination uh you know uh

783
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,880
it's it's literally i don't want to say

784
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,399
an attribute certificate is but it's

785
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,480
pretty much an attribute certificate

786
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,239
that has all the attributes of the asset

787
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,159
it's just a description of what it is it

788
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,399
doesn't say anything about ownership

789
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,399
status and so on and most important

790
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,799
thing it needs to have a validation

791
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
endpoint a url there that says this is

792
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,840
the place where you can you know

793
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,440
validate the status of this

794
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,959
you know this asset particularly legal

795
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
status um

796
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,240
the other one role is to uh crash

797
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,439
recovery so

798
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,000
so uh in our model g1 and g2

799
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,840
needs uh to maintain log you know for

800
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,760
every message it needs to block so

801
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
so the question is what bits and

802
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,679
information need to be

803
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,559
kept by g1 and g2 just in case one or

804
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,080
both

805
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,918
you know crashes so that's you know the

806
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,760
first question second question is

807
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,440
what what is what is the recovery model

808
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,080
do we use pairs you know

809
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,679
uh primary and backup gateways you know

810
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,360
it's all the obvious question

811
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,600
very interesting but but we're going to

812
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,479
put that in in in that second this last

813
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,840
bucket of

814
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,200
the log metadata log data regarding in a

815
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,879
crash and and if there is

816
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,720
in you know interest then we can you

817
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,320
know make that you know we can focus on

818
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,799
on that draft um next slide please uh

819
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,840
francisco

820
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,120
uh so proposed roadmap so we're here in

821
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,760
itf 109

822
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,039
uh doing the presentation and you know

823
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,080
we'd like to invite people to

824
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,919
participate

825
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,080
on the mailing list the mailing list is

826
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,679
at the bottom of this slide

827
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,439
uh our plans is to uh request

828
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,240
uh for boss session uh at the next ietf

829
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,559
in march

830
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,000
basically to ask for a working group so

831
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,760
so the aim is is basically

832
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
to work on the drafts until it's

833
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,080
reasonably mature

834
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,519
that we understand more clearly what is

835
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,519
in scope and out of scope

836
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,440
uh and we identify some of some

837
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,360
difficulties you know

838
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,200
quite complex questions um we'd like to

839
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,879
you know work on the three drafts at

840
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,200
least you know

841
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,240
you know and get it finished by you know

842
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,840
the november

843
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,840
ietf next year uh and then

844
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,360
then you know if that's accomplished we

845
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,600
can say well you know do we close down

846
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,760
the working group or do we recharter

847
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,799
meaning you know add you know add some

848
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,879
more items but

849
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:38,080
basically the next sort of milestone for

850
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,679
us is is

851
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,240
asking the ads and and the security area

852
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,240
for

853
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,600
for a buff uh in in march um

854
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,880
next slide please francesca

855
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,080
uh so i i i had uh this question

856
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,919
actually several times

857
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,240
from people like you know some people

858
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,000
don't know who or what the itf is

859
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,159
uh some people do and of course groups

860
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,480
are like so why the idea

861
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,399
why not go to these various

862
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,600
organizations and and there are several

863
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,639
and i won't name them

864
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,678
and and go there and my answer is that

865
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,080
you know uh the itf has neutrality in

866
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,679
this

867
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:21,279
particular area so the icf doesn't

868
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,600
claim to own any specific you know um

869
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,720
blockchain or dlp system right it's

870
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,760
pretty neutral

871
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,760
um more importantly actually uh the itf

872
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,519
has a long history of gateway protocols

873
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,519
but for those who are around

874
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,000
you know back in the late 90s you know

875
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,880
ibmr ibr the whole discussion about you

876
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,919
know

877
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,399
bgp and for those who are in the

878
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,440
uh ipsec uh working group in the late

879
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,080
you know 90s

880
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,279
you know again we had you know uh uh the

881
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,918
ipsec and the ike

882
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,360
discussion and and you know if if you

883
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,159
think about it

884
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,199
a a vpn box that's you know running ip

885
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,480
second ike

886
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,640
ip1 or ipv2 it's essentially a gateway

887
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
right a gateway that that interconnects

888
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,200
you know subnets or networks and in fact

889
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:06,559
you know

890
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,120
enterprises the security area has a lot

891
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,359
of uh

892
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,480
expertise in security protocols um you

893
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,639
just have to

894
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,480
visit the rats working group and and you

895
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,960
know what i what i'm saying and you know

896
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,199
so i

897
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,800
i feel comfortable that that we will

898
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:21,118
receive sufficient

899
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,520
you know criticism and and you know

900
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,000
positive contribution to the design

901
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,599
and i you know i prefer to be you know

902
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,320
getting these difficult questions

903
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,679
in the itf you know while the protocols

904
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,760
are being developed versus

905
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,440
you know later on you know you know down

906
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,560
the road when you know we find you know

907
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,000
flaws

908
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,679
and for those who who um didn't know

909
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
don't know about the itf i usually say

910
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,480
well you know itf is the home of

911
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,879
gcp ipsec i per brush tls oauth glab

912
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,520
you know all the json encryption and

913
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,719
signing

914
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,359
co-op rats and so on and the itf as far

915
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,480
as i know

916
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,319
has numerous uh liaison agreements with

917
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
various organizations i think these are

918
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
the things these are the liaisons that

919
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,680
i'm

920
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,880
aware of you know in the past itu

921
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:16,480
3gpp and so on

922
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:18,640
next slide please francesca

923
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,920
oh so that's that's the uh this is the

924
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,680
last slide uh

925
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,920
cough you know please join this this

926
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,279
mailing list you know uh do i do ask

927
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,720
questions because

928
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,680
uh we don't know uh of the answers

929
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,799
and uh the the more questions uh we have

930
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,960
the more

931
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,960
uh clarity i think we'll we'll get you

932
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
know with regards to the design of the

933
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,160
gateway protocol

934
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,359
uh so that's the end of my slides

935
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,319
uh if anyone has any questions uh should

936
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,960
i turn off video

937
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
francesca

938
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,480
you can keep video on if you want if you

939
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,480
want okay

940
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,680
my queue for anybody who wants to

941
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,240
want to give any feedback and also there

942
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,078
has been a lot of discussion in the chat

943
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:11,279
so and we lost one of our

944
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,200
co-chairs so let's try to keep

945
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,800
the important comments to to the

946
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:26,399
microphone so that we

947
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:28,320
get the good feel of the room

948
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,359
jonathan hoyland um so if you wanted to

949
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
get in here that would have been fine

950
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,560
with me but um

951
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,960
uh but i guess not um so

952
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,680
uh thanks for the presentation thomas um

953
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,280
you know i think

954
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,720
it's certainly fine for you to have a

955
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,320
mailing list um

956
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,078
but um you know i'm somewhat familiar

957
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,359
with this i'm somewhat familiar with uh

958
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,400
the technology though i'm proud as

959
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
familiar as you

960
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,240
and there's a bunch of concepts here

961
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,839
that i think would be required to um

962
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,598
i've seen this successfully that i do

963
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,839
not think are familiar to the itf

964
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,440
um and i have to say i look at your i

965
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,720
look at your current mailing list and it

966
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,079
seems to have like relatively lot of

967
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,118
participation from a lot of people i

968
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,000
would think would be relevant for such a

969
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,760
protocol

970
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
um the example um examples you gave of

971
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,240
um

972
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,920
the the signal difference between the

973
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,000
examples you give your protocols

974
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,359
uh that we do gateway protocols and this

975
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,240
is like we actually understood the

976
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,359
protocols and

977
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,040
largely controlled the protocols on

978
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,000
either end of the gateways and in this

979
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,000
case we do not

980
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,599
so i guess um you know we had a number

981
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,119
of puzzles for um

982
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,400
blockchain work in ietf and we've

983
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,079
largely not done any of them and i think

984
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,359
that this one we also should not do

985
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,760
um for basically the same reason which

986
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,440
is we don't know what we're doing and um

987
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,119
you know um i think if you show up with

988
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,400
like you know

989
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,680
major representatives from like four

990
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,720
different important blockchains then my

991
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,319
opinion will change

992
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,160
but or it might change but i think at

993
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,400
the present that is not the case

994
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,680
sure sure uh yeah no no agree i think i

995
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,599
think part of the

996
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,118
sort of my approach in life is if we

997
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,280
don't understand it then

998
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,800
let's let's work on it so that we

999
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,720
understand it right and but you're right

1000
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
i think i think our effort now is

1001
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,959
you know uh to get you know a number of

1002
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,280
the you know participants and and i know

1003
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,680
who you mean like this three or four the

1004
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,240
of the of the sort of projects out there

1005
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,000
to get involved because in fact um you

1006
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,759
know something like this benefits them

1007
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,240
right and so and also we're trying to

1008
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,400
get the the the user base

1009
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,078
of of the technology involved right so

1010
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,760
so you know um

1011
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
crypto exchanges uh you know um

1012
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,040
crypto providers you know to get

1013
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,759
involved in in this work but no thank

1014
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,480
you that's that's

1015
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,200
that's very good comment and all quite

1016
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,200
quite legitimate

1017
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,839
thank you go ahead west

1018
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,280
i think it's actually you uh i was

1019
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,640
debating whether to ask this question

1020
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
then you just led with the information

1021
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
so now i want to ask the question which

1022
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,760
is

1023
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,520
do you have any idea how large this

1024
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,079
solution would actually apply to in the

1025
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
real world

1026
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,520
i mean you know are we talking just a

1027
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,800
few connections between a few

1028
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,240
uh various blockchains or you know it's

1029
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,920
sort of an n squared type problem

1030
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,959
because you you know in theory you might

1031
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,560
have a connection for

1032
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,240
every particular blockchain and every

1033
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,160
other particular blockchain but

1034
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,680
unless you have a lot of buy-in from

1035
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,480
existing people that

1036
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,160
want to do this i worry that it could be

1037
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
a lot of work for

1038
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,000
uh not a whole lot of gain if if you

1039
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,359
know it's not actually going to be used

1040
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,920
it seems like we should get a lot of

1041
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,400
buy-in

1042
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,119
at the time i agree agree that's a

1043
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,520
actually very

1044
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
very good question thank you so so so

1045
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,560
actually

1046
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,920
one of the reasons that motivated this

1047
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,759
work at this time

1048
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,040
you know we could have done this five

1049
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,000
years ago you know

1050
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,759
is is a couple of things um the fact

1051
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,200
that that you know bitcoin is now at

1052
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,480
least 10 years old

1053
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,799
ethereum is five years old uh six years

1054
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,480
uh we don't have any interoperability

1055
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,040
interoperability between the two

1056
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,320
you know uh hyperledger fabric with all

1057
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,960
its um sort of

1058
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,240
um different groups it's at least four

1059
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,760
years old

1060
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,680
so we still don't have interoperability

1061
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,920
but the big one is this question of

1062
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,680
you know central bank uh currencies so

1063
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,040
so for those who are following this

1064
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:02,480
you know discussion you know the sec

1065
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,480
the fed uh the u.s fed and in fact even

1066
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,200
even the the ec eu ecb bank in europe

1067
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,400
they're all contemplating the need of a

1068
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,799
digital

1069
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,599
fiat currency a digital currency issued

1070
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,440
by

1071
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,119
you know a sovereign government right

1072
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,960
that's kind of the you know uh the

1073
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,880
definition so the question is

1074
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,960
will there be a role for blockchain and

1075
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,560
dlps maybe maybe not there are some

1076
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,160
people saying no we don't we don't need

1077
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,960
blockchains or dlps that's fine some

1078
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,440
people are saying that

1079
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,440
actually we might need it and so in fact

1080
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,920
uh i personally believe

1081
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,960
that interoperability will be forced

1082
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,200
upon all of us

1083
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,160
you know the whole world if we really

1084
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,480
want to use

1085
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,680
um central bank issued currents cbdc's

1086
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,319
so so

1087
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,399
without interoperability cbdc's will not

1088
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,440
be able to flow across systems which is

1089
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,720
in fact again totally opposite than the

1090
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,520
whole idea of of

1091
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,399
of a fiat you know fiat currency so so

1092
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,240
if you have a

1093
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,079
greenback you can go to any bank in the

1094
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,799
united states and that greenback

1095
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,400
represents

1096
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,520
your claim onto the issuer in this case

1097
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,440
the central bank and

1098
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,119
every bank will accept it well right now

1099
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,800
we don't have that so that

1100
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,400
sort of if i come along with a

1101
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,240
particular stable coin there's

1102
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,760
there's only a limited place where i can

1103
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,759
actually be you know

1104
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,880
exchanged or that my currency will be

1105
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,520
accepted but no that's

1106
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,800
that's in fact a very good point uh was

1107
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,400
and you know that's that's one of the

1108
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,240
reasons why you want to have

1109
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,160
you know a mailing list is to get and

1110
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,720
invite all these people

1111
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,598
many of them are not itf people itf

1112
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,879
attendees

1113
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,880
you know to come and participate

1114
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,480
okay next thank you daniel go ahead

1115
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,000
uh hi there daniel kahn gilmore aclu uh

1116
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,839
so thomas thanks for this presentation

1117
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,760
i'm still struggling a little bit with

1118
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,839
the um the underlying uh ideas

1119
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,520
uh i'm in particular concerned that i

1120
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,319
don't understand

1121
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,720
uh if the two distributed ledgers are

1122
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,520
not

1123
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
using the same protocol internally and

1124
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,599
they

1125
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,119
don't necessarily know much about how

1126
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,040
the other one works how

1127
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
either one can guarantee lack of a

1128
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,119
double spend on the other one

1129
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,078
right good good one as well so that that

1130
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,680
is that is um

1131
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,200
that's in fact one of one of the

1132
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,319
challenges is that

1133
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,000
so if g1 is trying to transfer to g2

1134
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:19,759
g1 needs to give g2 sufficient

1135
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,520
evidence that the asset in the dlt the

1136
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,040
first dlp has been either

1137
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,240
locked or escrowed so so there's this

1138
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,040
notion of an escrow

1139
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,439
where where for example alice the sender

1140
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,680
could escrow temporarily the money to

1141
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,240
the gateway or the gateway owner

1142
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,359
until the transfer and completed and so

1143
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,399
so we need a way

1144
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,480
to enable g1 and g2

1145
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,079
to collaborate so that if if any one of

1146
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,079
them lies so

1147
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,160
g1 could cheat g1 could say hey look you

1148
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,800
know i've blocked the asset and so on

1149
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,799
so so the messages that proclaim or

1150
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,560
these assertions or claims by g1 that

1151
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,200
it's done its job in locking

1152
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,240
or escrowing that needs to be signed by

1153
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,480
g1 and

1154
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,759
g1 in particular so that so that if

1155
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,160
there's any dispute

1156
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,359
g2 can say but you know hey you know

1157
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,078
three messages

1158
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,560
ago you said that the asset has been

1159
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,960
locked

1160
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,759
all right and so if there's any dispute

1161
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,599
it goes

1162
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,800
basically the owners in this case

1163
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,359
entities called vast

1164
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,040
basic you know asset service providers

1165
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,359
can dispute this off chain

1166
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,680
and and you know recover it but but that

1167
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,279
this is this is one of the challenges

1168
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,680
uh that that you know if you want to

1169
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,560
have an opaque design that the dlts are

1170
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,160
opaque then

1171
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
then you have to solve this you know

1172
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,680
possible cheating problem

1173
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,079
between g1 and g2 i hope that helps but

1174
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,319
yeah

1175
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,520
this is this is what this is why we're

1176
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,440
trying to have a mailing list

1177
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,880
is is you know this is the this is the

1178
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,079
kind of topics that you want to talk

1179
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,640
about

1180
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,160
but i just worried thank you that sorry

1181
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,200
it just seems like that

1182
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,759
um your claim earlier was that you don't

1183
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,078
want

1184
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,079
the protocol to know anything about say

1185
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,839
the value of the asset

1186
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,359
it just seems like that doesn't line up

1187
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,880
with what you just described but maybe

1188
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,440
i'm misunderstanding it it's all

1189
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,280
it's also a funny hour for me so maybe

1190
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,480
i'm not getting it

1191
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,720
so so so the the g1 needs to

1192
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,560
just use the lock or the escrow example

1193
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,879
so so if if there's an asset

1194
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,520
representation on dlt one you know

1195
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,040
here's you know uh 10 units of this

1196
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,000
particular asset

1197
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,599
and uh the asset is described by the

1198
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,359
profile there's so there's a pointer or

1199
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,680
hash to the to the profile

1200
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,839
file somewhere you know it's json file

1201
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,319
and so g1 is saying that hey

1202
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,078
uh i have made i have disabled

1203
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,319
temporarily disabled

1204
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
access to this asset representation on

1205
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,240
glp one

1206
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,359
while the transfer occurred right and so

1207
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,759
so

1208
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,200
so that asset you know 10 units of this

1209
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,839
asset is now

1210
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,839
unavailable to anyone on dlt one and so

1211
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,599
um uh

1212
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:56,000
g1 now has to transfer that to g2

1213
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,720
uh you know in using you know a

1214
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,480
commitment

1215
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,720
protocol such as two-phase commits so

1216
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,440
that there's no ambiguity

1217
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,078
and at the end of that transfer uh now

1218
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,800
that that

1219
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,160
that asset has to be created the same

1220
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,040
representation or equivalent

1221
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,879
representation has to be created by g2

1222
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,640
in dlt2 right and once that happens

1223
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,760
the asset has to be destroyed or

1224
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,640
distinguished extinguished in dlp1

1225
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
and and created in in dlt2 right so

1226
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:27,680
that's how the transfer occurred

1227
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,118
it it it is it is destroyed in dlt1 it

1228
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,960
is created in dlg2

1229
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,160
that's kind of the model but we're open

1230
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,079
to any kind of

1231
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,720
other model if you have any ideas about

1232
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,640
you know what's a suitable model to

1233
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,640
to to actually do asset transfers

1234
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,839
okay phil go ahead

1235
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,119
you you i can't hear you i don't know if

1236
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:01,839
you muted via the

1237
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,839
headset or something else

1238
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:17,119
you seem to be unmuted via mythical but

1239
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,118
so it could be like

1240
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,480
no still nothing you're not gonna type

1241
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,480
your question phil type the question in

1242
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
jabber

1243
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,160
for a lot of people so uh there's a

1244
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,760
there's a medeco outage right now and um

1245
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,000
not everybody can get into the jabber

1246
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,000
chat

1247
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
use the mailing list phil i'm working

1248
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:52,400
okay let's let's move to wes and

1249
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,520
stay stay on audio just to try

1250
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,560
phil to see if you can get it to work

1251
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,599
yeah he can he can start talking

1252
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,359
if he interests me that's great um so a

1253
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,960
couple of things with relation to the g1

1254
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,598
g2 interfaces i've thought about this

1255
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,599
one

1256
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,040
it's unclear because you've used generic

1257
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,599
terms of g1 and g2

1258
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,359
if these are supposed to be anonymous

1259
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,720
gateways that don't necessarily have to

1260
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,960
know each other or whether there's a

1261
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,680
business relationship between them

1262
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,280
and there can be something no anonymity

1263
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,160
no anonymity sorry i should have put

1264
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,800
that on a slide

1265
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,640
so gateways are owned by if you read the

1266
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,520
architectures they're owned by legal

1267
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,040
entities

1268
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,119
so if you want to if you want to

1269
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,079
transfer legally

1270
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,920
recognized assets you have to be legal

1271
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:39,200
businesses today

1272
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,280
right okay so there's we know in fact

1273
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,040
in fact that you know i'm saying and

1274
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,720
people might hate this i'm saying that

1275
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,240
the gateways need to have device

1276
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,520
identities which is why i

1277
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,479
i cited the rats uh work and i

1278
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,520
i dev id that michael richardson is is

1279
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,480
doing is because

1280
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,119
the gateways need device identities fair

1281
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,720
enough

1282
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,280
the other thing that i think needs to be

1283
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,879
carefully considered is uh

1284
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:08,720
blockchains have different levels of

1285
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,400
of a non not i can never say that word

1286
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,040
of how well somebody can remain

1287
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,640
anonymous within the blockchain right

1288
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,880
so the instant that you actually

1289
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,598
possibly do transfers across it you may

1290
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,720
actually

1291
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,119
disclose and and in

1292
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,720
an identity across that that that is a

1293
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
ramification of actually doing that

1294
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,319
transfer and right so

1295
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,598
so no great great question so so uh so

1296
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,119
that stuff occurs

1297
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,280
if you look at the architecture drop in

1298
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,839
phase one so so right now

1299
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,319
there is a raging debate in in another

1300
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,759
world

1301
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:43,359
in another set of calls that i attend uh

1302
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,599
and it has to do with what is called the

1303
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,558
travel rule so the travel rule follows

1304
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,920
from the banking

1305
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,760
secrecy act in 1996 when what the travel

1306
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,599
rule basically says that

1307
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,079
if you do correspondent banking so if i

1308
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,440
go down my street here go to bank of

1309
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
america and i say hey

1310
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,280
could you please transmit you know a

1311
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,720
hundred dollars to where's

1312
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,640
actually make it make it bigger ten

1313
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,598
thousand dollars to where's in

1314
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,279
in tokyo bank of tokyo downtown tokyo

1315
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,960
right so when that happens

1316
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,880
uh bank of america has to transmit

1317
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,079
my information personal information

1318
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,000
which is

1319
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,319
first name last name telephone number

1320
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,440
home address account number at least so

1321
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,640
i'm the originator

1322
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,880
so that's the originator information the

1323
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,879
tokyo bank bank of tokyo needs to send

1324
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,200
back to bank of america

1325
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,880
you know the the first name last name an

1326
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,598
account number of the

1327
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,400
beneficiary in this case say where's in

1328
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,640
in tokyo

1329
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,880
right and and this has been going on for

1330
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:43,598
30 years now this is the standard

1331
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,720
mechanism to do correspondent banking so

1332
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,280
what's happened now

1333
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,118
is that the organization that that

1334
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,720
defines the standards

1335
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,720
and the policies to do that called the

1336
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,919
fat of has just declared

1337
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,439
last year that you know any kind of

1338
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,520
transfer of value needs to follow the

1339
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,119
travel rule so that means the big crypto

1340
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,520
exchanges such as

1341
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,280
you know you know coinbase the probably

1342
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,480
the largest one kraken

1343
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:13,520
if they transmit any kind of value to

1344
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,680
another exchange in uh you know in tokyo

1345
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,359
they have to implement the travel rule

1346
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,879
and this is a headache

1347
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:22,240
particularly this if the uh owner of the

1348
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,559
keeper is anonymous

1349
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,640
on the sending site so if the originator

1350
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,960
is is saying it's anonymous

1351
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,160
the question is should should the

1352
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,680
exchange actually

1353
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,558
fulfill the request and actually

1354
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:36,319
transmit to tokyo because now

1355
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,000
the exchanges are going to be liable

1356
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,640
legally and they could be

1357
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,119
you know shut down by the sec any time

1358
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,000
you know

1359
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,920
for you know failing to implement the

1360
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,079
travel rule so so so

1361
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,000
in our model we're assuming that all of

1362
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,440
that has occurred in phase one that

1363
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,200
that's out of scope for us

1364
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,200
and that in fact um the originator

1365
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,240
entity the beneficiary entity the

1366
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,359
gateway owner

1367
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,640
a g1 owner g2 owner unknown and they've

1368
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,558
completed the whole

1369
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,000
you know funny handshake to do travel

1370
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,119
rule and then

1371
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,520
our work really starts in phase two of

1372
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,200
the architecture draft but very good

1373
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,280
question it's actually

1374
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,118

1393
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,759
queue so just

1394
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:08,000
information a lot of people have had

1395
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,000
problems with mythical so

1396
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,599
whatever happens today we for sure have

1397
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,200
to

1398
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,200
get more input in the meaning list

1399
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,078
so but we've heard so far and please uh

1400
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,200
correct me

1401
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,160
anybody my co-chairs the 80s if i heard

1402
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,759
wrong

1403
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,040
uh support to um

1404
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,319
create a main list for more discussion

1405
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,480
and discussion is required for

1406
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,480
for

1407
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:47,839
development so to motivate

1408
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,640
list in fact listed at the bottom of

1409
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,640
this slide

1410
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,280
sorry what did you say i said isn't

1411
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,559
there already a mailing list listed at

1412
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,920
the bottom of the slide that has been

1413
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:05,359
created yes

1414
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,720
yes the mailing list is live so so i i

1415
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,440
guess my point would be let us do

1416
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,759
nothing

1417
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,839
and if this mailing list actually shows

1418
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,559
substantial amounts of interest and

1419
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,920
um you know and an activity that like we

1420
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,599
think was credible then we can raise the

1421
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,559
question of something else

1422
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,280
yep that's a good point yeah a good

1423
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,720
point thank you

1424
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,119
edgar yes

1425
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,640
so the dispatching outcome will be uh

1426
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,760
create a mini list which has already

1427
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,118
been created and

1428
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,119
redirect discussion there

1429
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,279
hey um so i know some people are having

1430
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,319
trouble with the chat here there's also

1431
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,880
an authentication

1432
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:50,160
problem happening with meet echo and um

1433
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,880
so we're gonna have to do a

1434
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,799
vm reboot and it's gonna take all of the

1435
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,720
sessions out for about five minutes

1436
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:02,079
and that's gonna happen in two minutes

1437
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,919
okay okay sorry

1438
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,760
yeah no worries and good that we were at

1439
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,400
the end of this topic then so it will

1440
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:15,440
not kill us

1441
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,440
main discussion um

1442
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:22,640
maybe francesco we pause for

1443
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,480
the reboot and we come back in what

1444
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,400
so it's five minutes so like in 10

1445
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,599
minutes and get the next session started

1446
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,160
what do you think yeah it sounds good uh

1447
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,440
i hope it would take less than 10

1448
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,960
minutes or

1449
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,280
do we have any information about that

1450
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,319
so it says okay five minutes plus two

1451
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,760
minutes

1452
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,759
yeah okay around that

1453
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:52,400
let i'll be back here uh in

1454
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:55,200
let's say at the top of the hour

1455
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,040
i will set slides so this this topic is

1456
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,598
concluded and we have a dispatching

1457
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,599
outcome

1458
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:07,839
or that will have to obviously be

1459
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:07,839
confirmed in the main list as well but

1460
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,200
great talk to you in five minutes

1461
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,839
thanks francesca

1462
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,119
we have almost everyone back yet but not

1463
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:21,839
francesca so we'll

1464
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:21,839
give her a moment to join

1465
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,880
having trouble joining with the next

1466
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,520
presenter

1467
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,839
share their slides so that hopefully by

1468
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,240
the time she joins we can just get going

1469

uh that you reload your window or close

1474
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,760
your tab and kind of try again

1475
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:10,640

01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:45,839
my second

1488
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,400
you should have slides now

okay so i'll get started i'm uh schumann

1491
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,760
huck and this is actually

1492
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,160
a joint presentation with my

1493
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,760
collaborator ash wilson who will also be

1494
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,839
speaking in the second part of the talk

1495
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,520
so if he could

1496
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:43,119
i don't know what he needs to do whether

1497
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,960
you need to guys need to promote him to

1498
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,240
speaker or whether he can just join

1499
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,839
himself

1500
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,240
or be prepared to do so that would be

1501
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:52,319
good um

1502
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,439
we would like to talk about the general

1503
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,759
topic of

1504
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,960
gain authentication for the internet of

1505
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,760
things

1506
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,839
and this being sec dispatch i assume

1507
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,839
folks are already familiar with dane but

1508
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:05,920
just in case you aren't

1509
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,000
the high level summary is that it's a

1510
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,200
protocol that uses the dns

1511
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,920
and specifically signed dns records to

1512
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,759
authenticate

1513
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:18,799
x 509 certificates and or public keys

1514
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,799
so next slide please

1515
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,319
so some of the topics we're going to

1516
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,200
cover today are listed here we'll go

1517
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:27,920
over

1518
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,000
some uh background on pre-existing work

1519
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,559
that we're picking up again

1520
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,079
so this is a dane for tls client

1521
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,960
authentication for which

1522
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,839
there are a couple of drafts that you

1523
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,240
may have seen

1524
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,680
announced on the mailing list recently

1525
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,359
and we'll summarize past

1526
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,440
engagement on this work and who is

1527
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,920
interested in advancing it

1528
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,599
we'll also mention some upcoming work

1529
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,359
that we're planning to do

1530
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:52,880
and what we're hoping to get out of the

1531
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,720
discussion today

1532
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:59,280
is where in terms of ietf venues

1533
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,720
we might pursue this work and also to

1534
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,440
generally get feedback

1535
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:07,038
and recruit others into helping out if

1536
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:07,039
there is interest in these topics

1537
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:21,839
next slide

1538
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:23,598
okay good um so the two drafts that we

1539
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:26,839
currently have

1540
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:31,200
were originally developed in mid

1541
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:34,160
2015 the first tls client authentication

1542
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,558
via tlsa records specifies how to do

1543
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,279
dain

1544
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,799
client authentication in tls and the

1545
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:44,400
second one defines a new tls extension

1546
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:47,759
to convey a client stain identity

1547
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:51,359
the original target use cases were one

1548
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,240
iot device authentication and second

1549
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:55,440
authenticating clients in smtp transport

1550
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,759
security

1551
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,720
for the second case you may be aware

1552
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,039
that that's an

1553
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,038
area that has already seen some uptake

1554
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,720
in day and authentication on the server

1555
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:08,160
side

1556
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:11,598
um we presented this work back in itf

1557
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:14,240
93 in the summer of 2015

1558
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,760
in the dane working group which existed

1559
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:18,240
at that time

1560
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,680
so provided a pointer to the slide deck

1561
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,598
for that presentation

1562
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,799
there was quite a bit of subsequent

1563
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,599
discussion

1564
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:26,240
on the list around that time but then

1565
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,640
the

1566
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,000
dane working group shut down because it

1567
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,118
had

1568
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,400
finished its um original charter of work

1569
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,319
and the authors

1570
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,400
didn't really have the time or energy to

1571
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,359
continue pursuing it

1572
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,559
but uh in the intervening years where i

1573
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,480
i'd say we're

1574
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,079
approached pretty regularly by

1575
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,839
miscellaneous parties

1576
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,559
many of them in the iot space about

1577
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,200
reviving and continuing the work which

1578
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:57,839
we are finally planning to do

1579
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,839
um so next slide please francesca

1580
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:03,598
all right so i'll give a quick protocol

1581
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,799
summary now the

1582
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,559
tls client has an identity in the form

1583
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,319
of a domain name

1584
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,319
a public and private key pair and a

1585
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:14,000
certificate binding the public key

1586
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:16,000
to the domain name and there is a

1587
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,679
corresponding tlsa record

1588
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,040
published in the dns the tls server

1589
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,560
sends a certificate

1590
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,799
request message in the handshake

1591
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,640
extracts the client identity from the

1592
01:08:26,799 --> 01:08:31,839
presented certificate

1593
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,759
obtains the tlsa record and validates it

1594
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,080
against the certificate or the public

1595
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,279
key

1596
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,318
in the certificate and we also have a

1597
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:41,120
new tls

1598
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:42,880
proposed new tls extension called dane

1599
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,399
client identity it has a couple of

1600
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,679
purposes

1601
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,839
uh first to signal support uh

1602
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,719
for this protocol which can actually be

1603
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,839
done with just an

1604
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,239
empty extension but it can also be used

1605
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:57,679
to

1606
01:08:54,238 --> 01:09:00,158
convey the actual client's dns identity

1607
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,880
which is needed to support for example

1608
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,879
tls

1609
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:04,839
raw public key authentication as

1610
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,640
described in rfc

1611
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:12,238
7250 the draft currently mentions

1612
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,920
using ech encrypted client hello

1613
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:16,080
in the latter case to protect the

1614
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,920
privacy of the transmitted name

1615
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,000
and that part is likely going to change

1616
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:23,120
based on uh discussion that has happened

1617
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,719
recently so eric riscorla has reviewed

1618
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,920
the draft on the mailing list and made

1619
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:30,560
some suggestions that we're considering

1620
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:33,040
in tls 1.3 we can actually place these

1621
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,960
extensions in the certificate request

1622
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,080
and certificate messages which are both

1623
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,000
encrypted

1624
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,198
rather than in the client hello and

1625
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,880
server hello

1626
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:43,678
and then we don't actually need to

1627
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,560
resort to ech to protect the

1628
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,399
first flight data from the client then

1629
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:52,000
the remaining question would be

1630
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:53,839
what to do about tls 1.2 support

1631
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,840
um there was another suggestion about

1632
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:58,239
modifying the extension

1633
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,760
data definition to properly allow

1634
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,519
extensibility and there have been some

1635
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:04,800
back and forth comments about that list

1636
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,800
that need to be sorted out too

1637
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:08,080
next slide please

1638
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,760
so the newly refreshed versions of these

1639
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,920
drafts have a few other small changes

1640
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,440
from the original versions and i'm just

1641
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,520
going to quickly summarize those the

1642
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:23,919
main two ones are

1643
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,719
simplification originally we supported

1644
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,880
two

1645
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:29,280
subject alternative name fields in the

1646
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,800
certificate dns name

1647
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:36,080
and srv name that's rfc 4985

1648
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,120
so we now specify only dns name srv name

1649
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,719
is really

1650
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,800
as far as we can tell not used in the

1651
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,520
real world at least not yet

1652
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,080
and if we need to specify service

1653
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,440
specific

1654
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,559
identities the dns owner name format in

1655
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,799
the tls record

1656
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,000
tlsa record can easily encode an

1657
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:54,400
application specific

1658
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,440
label which it already does in one of

1659
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:58,159
the

1660
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,480
proposed formats in the draft the second

1661
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,879
one

1662
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,000
is relaxing the record name format

1663
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,320
originally

1664
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,120
i think we were too prescriptive with

1665
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,120
the format and that aspect of the draft

1666
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,559
caused quite a bit of arguing on the

1667
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,320
list

1668
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,159
different applications will probably

1669
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,519
prefer different formats anyway so now

1670
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,559
the draft just

1671
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,120
recommends what we might think could be

1672
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,199
widely

1673
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,199
applicable formats but allows others

1674
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,600
so the other part of the work that we

1675
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:30,880
want to discuss is we want to expand the

1676
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,640
scope of the dane for iot work

1677
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,159
so in particular object security

1678
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,840
applications of dane

1679
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,599
there are quite a number of folks in the

1680
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,000
iot space that would like to use

1681
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,400
dane more generally for object security

1682
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,360
so neither of the currently defined

1683
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:49,599
records tlsa or sma are well suited here

1684
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,759
tlsa currently is defined for tls

1685
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:55,040
channel authentication only

1686
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,360
and s mine a is for is object security

1687
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,120
for

1688
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,400
email applications and further has a

1689
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:00,239
record format

1690
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,599
that is defined in terms of email

1691
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:05,040
identities

1692
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,719
we could of course propose a new rr type

1693
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,120
but that means a much longer development

1694
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,080
in the

1695
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:12,080
adoption cycle and tlsa is already

1696
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,280
widely known and in use and the proposal

1697
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,440
on the table which

1698
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,599
ash will talk about in much more detail

1699
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,678
is to extend its scope to cover this use

1700
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,159
case also

1701
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,880
where we also would like to use dns and

1702
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,799
dane

1703
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,640
more generally for certificate discovery

1704
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,920
and i'm going to defer

1705
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,760
that part of the discussion to my

1706
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:33,679
co-presenter too

1707
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,679
um next slide please francesca

1708
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:39,920
as for who wants to advance this work uh

1709
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:42,000
well the authors naturally but there's

1710
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,840
also quite a bit of interest from

1711
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,920
colleagues that we

1712
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,199
uh have in the past and are currently

1713
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,560
speaking to

1714
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:52,400
at places like nist icann

1715
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,199
and the laura alliance that's an

1716
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,440
alliance of lp1 device manufacturers and

1717
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:57,440
more

1718
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:02,159
so at this point

1719
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,840
i'm going to switch over to my

1720
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:06,000
co-presenter but before i do that i

1721
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,960
wanted to see if there are any questions

1722
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,080
or comments on the currently published

1723
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:18,080
drafts about

1724
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:20,880
dane tls client authentication

1725
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,880
and let's go ahead

1726
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,480
hi guys how's it going uh this is elliot

1727
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,239
i just had one quick question about

1728
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,440
your drop which was can you say more

1729
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:33,440
about the iot aspects that you expect

1730
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,639
you guys talk about it in the draft but

1731
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,320
it's i think

1732
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,560
you spent about a half paragraph and

1733
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:42,239
could you elaborate just a bit oh yes we

1734
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
definitely can so i i think what i'm

1735
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,959
going to do is i'm going to i'm going to

1736
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,559
defer to ash because he's going to talk

1737
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,400
about the iot

1738
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,679
motivation and use case in much more

1739
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,440
detail so i think you'll get your

1740
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,080
answers there elliot

1741
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,080
thank you very much

1742
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,320
all right thanks a bunch i think i can

1743
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,880
take it from here this is ashley thanks

1744
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:06,000
shimon

1745
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,360
go for it um can we advance the fly

1746
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,719
the uh slides please francesco

1747
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:17,280
uh so to sort of frame our thinking on

1748
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:19,440
iot device identity um it's

1749
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,800
a in a very basic sense a digital

1750
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,360
identity is

1751
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,000
a name and a way of proving ownership of

1752
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:27,360
a name

1753
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,480
and the um and the value of any sort of

1754
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,559
identity strategy

1755
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,320
or identity system is how widely the

1756
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,920
name is recognized

1757
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:39,920
and how resistant that system is

1758
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:42,960
to impersonation attacks

1759
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,600
the challenges with iot specifically

1760
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,560
um is you know with decoupled

1761
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,120
applications

1762
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,960
uh it's certificate discovery becomes

1763
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,280
difficult

1764
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:55,440
you end up with proprietary apis that

1765
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,840
are operated by certificate authorities

1766
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:59,440
and the consuming the message consuming

1767
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,560
application that needs to authenticate

1768
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,719
messages

1769
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,239
across a decoupled application then has

1770
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,520
to interact with that certificate

1771
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,360
authority consume

1772
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,440
and synchronize those certificates so

1773
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:12,799
that's one challenge

1774
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:15,839
um the there's a problem of subjective

1775
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:19,040
entity names that we oftentimes see

1776
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,920
within um you know within device

1777
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,480
certificates

1778
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,000
and you have a possibility of namespace

1779
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,239
collision do you really only guarantee

1780
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,760
the uniqueness of a name within the

1781
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,799
scope of a certificate

1782
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,159
authority and uh

1783
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,560
and that's another problem that we seek

1784
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:36,239
to to mitigate

1785
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,000
you know one of the ways that the

1786
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:41,280
industry is trying to mitigate

1787
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:44,400
the problem of um you know

1788
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,880
going across routes of trust

1789
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,320
is we're seeking to solve that with

1790
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,640
solutions like brewski

1791
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:52,080
right where you can automate a great

1792
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,400
deal of the onboarding process from

1793
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:58,480
manufacturer issued pki

1794
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,599
to locally issued or enterprise pki

1795
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,080
you know together with all of these

1796
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,920
other problems the fact that these

1797
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:07,120
platforms are really

1798
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,679
quite constrained and the example that

1799
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,199
i'll give

1800
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:13,760
is the the espressif esp32

1801
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,040
that's a really very common and widely

1802
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,880
used

1803
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,760
system on a chip that you often see

1804
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:23,199
shipped with about four megs of ram if

1805
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,560
you want to put the

1806
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:30,000
browser the browser ca bundle

1807
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,840
on it you know for tls

1808
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,760
just the server authentication aspect

1809
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,760
then that's 1.2 megs that you're

1810
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:39,280
dropping onto a four meg flash

1811
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:42,560
chip and so it doesn't

1812
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:44,320
it's i i guess an inelegant is a

1813
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,600
is a pretty good way to describe that

1814
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,840
aspect um

1815
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,840
could you advance the slide please

1816
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,440
um so dns is the my is

1817
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,360
definitely the most widely recognized

1818
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,040
namespace on the uh

1819
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:02,639
on the internet and public key

1820
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:07,519
authentication is

1821
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:09,199
uh is quite resilient to impersonation

1822
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,520
dane gives us the ability to use these

1823
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,919
two together it's a way of binding a dns

1824
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,640
name

1825
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,679
to a public key and this gives us an

1826
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,239
identity system

1827
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,840
that's resistant to collisions even

1828
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:21,280
across certificate authorities because

1829
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,239
even if two different authorities

1830
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,040
issue against the same name whichever

1831
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,120
public key

1832
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,519
is associated with the name and dns is

1833
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,599
the one that wins

1834
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,719
you don't have to worry about you know

1835
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,760
proprietary

1836
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:38,000
um interfaces with cas proprietary apis

1837
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,280
because the sdk for that interaction

1838
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
is already baked into the operating

1839
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,199
system um you can

1840
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,920
attribute um you know dubai

1841
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:49,599
uh device behavior via the dns hierarchy

1842
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,199
to whoever actually owns the

1843
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,880
identity um and that also gives a way to

1844
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,159
sort of repudiate that identity too you

1845
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,120
can tombstone the record

1846
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:00,639
or you can just delete it if that device

1847
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,679
should no longer be

1848
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,960
trusted and the current public key is

1849
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,040
always in dns

1850
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,800
this can you know can fit in with

1851
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:13,199
certificate rotation policies

1852
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:16,320
um you know and enable better um

1853
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:18,639
uh sort of identity hygiene

1854
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,759
and then you don't actually have to

1855
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,800
distribute

1856
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:25,360
certificates uh to

1857
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,480
um to authenticating parties when you

1858
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,080
considered like a decoupled architecture

1859
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:32,480
this is a discovery mechanism as opposed

1860
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:35,440
to distribution and the analogy here

1861
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,080
is sort of like the the host.txt file

1862
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,239
originally

1863
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:39,199
right that this sort of prompted the

1864
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,120
need for dns

1865
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,559
is because it became unwieldy to move

1866
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,840
around this host.txt file it was

1867
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:47,920
enormous

1868
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,920
and the rate of change was high um

1869
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:54,799
not exactly the same but similar we have

1870
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,360
you know managing certificate authority

1871
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,480
ca certificates uh for validating

1872
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:01,040
certificates

1873
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,879
can get that unwieldy for devices so

1874
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:05,199
moving from a distribution model to a

1875
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,600
discovery model

1876
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,879
can bring some elegance and simplify

1877
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,080
some things

1878
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,719
for a certificate discovery in iot

1879
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,719
next slide please

1880
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:23,440
so digging a little bit deeper into the

1881
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:24,799
implementation aspect uh this actually

1882
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:28,719
borrows from

1883
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:32,320
uh what we saw in the uh freeland barnes

1884
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:35,840
uh certificate id uh format for devices

1885
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:37,199
uh this was a draft um a few years ago

1886
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,520
that was presented but it's

1887
01:19:37,199 --> 01:19:41,280
it suggested the use of an underscore

1888
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,719
device label

1889
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:46,080
um you know within the certificate um

1890
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:47,120
and we think that actually fits pretty

1891
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,159
well here because it gives us a

1892
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,960
delegation point

1893
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:51,599
or a point beyond which we can delegate

1894
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,719
you know

1895
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,600
to either a third party provider or you

1896
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,640
know to

1897
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,480
a uh to a specific system that's under

1898
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:01,840
the control of whoever's managing the

1899
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,120
device identities for

1900
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,199
a uh for an organization and uh similar

1901
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:10,800
to how the s mine cert label works

1902
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:13,360
in 8162 um

1903
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,320
everything under s mime cert is a human

1904
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,480
identity

1905
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,639
and you know in this sense this would be

1906
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:21,759
everything under underscore device

1907
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:22,719
would be a device identity uh another

1908
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,440
difference in the two

1909
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,760
is this doesn't carry the the complexity

1910
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,960
that

1911
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:31,440
8162 has for hashing the email

1912
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,000
address local part to get something

1913
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,519
that's compatible

1914
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,120
with dns um devices would just have

1915
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,199
simple dns names

1916
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,559
and then you could have uh sub

1917
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,080
identities if

1918
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,920
if you wanted a device to have multiple

1919
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,880
certificates associated with it

1920
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,000
then you can use um you know different

1921
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,360
um

1922
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,400
labels uh say underscore labels on the

1923
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,280
uh

1924
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,480
you know on the far left of the dns name

1925
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,840
you know for

1926
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:01,839
smtp clients uh things like that

1927
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,600
the record type that we propose to use

1928
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,760
is tlsa

1929
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,360
there's no need to change the format of

1930
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,239
the record to serve this use case

1931
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,239
already works really well

1932
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,320
and this doesn't have to work

1933
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:16,879
exclusively for iot

1934
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,000
uh that's we've gotten some feedback

1935
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,159
that this might actually work pretty

1936
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,760
well for

1937
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:23,199
other applications microservices and

1938
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,080
things like that

1939
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:28,239
and since we're binding this to the

1940
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:31,120
universal namespace of dns

1941
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:33,440
then you could actually pretty easily

1942
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,199
and simply describe trust across

1943
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,960
organizations where you may have a

1944
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:39,360
client within one organization that's

1945
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,960
reaching out to a service

1946
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:45,199
that's presented by another organization

1947
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:47,920
and they can do mutual tls using dane

1948
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,919
next slide please

1949
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,440
um there are a few places in the stack

1950
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,440
where we think that this could

1951
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:59,440
that this could benefit the ecosystem

1952
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:02,879
right there's network authentication

1953
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:03,919
uh transport authentication

1954
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,920
further up there's message

1955
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,800
authentication and wrapping all of this

1956
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,280
together

1957
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:10,000
you get an authorization policy that

1958
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:13,199
starts looking

1959
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,960
like network access control lists i'm a

1960
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:18,239
former network engineer so this is

1961
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,239
just sort of how my brain works

1962
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,040
next slide please

1963
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,320
digging into the network authentication

1964
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:28,799
use case um

1965
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,920
this can be used to simplify radius

1966
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,520
configuration

1967
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:36,239
um radius often times for

1968
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,360
each tls involves interaction with

1969
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:42,959
certificate authorities

1970
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:42,960
and managing all of that stuff with dain

1971
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:49,040
it becomes as simple as managing a list

1972
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:52,480
of entities which are allowed to

1973
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:56,159
access a given vlan or

1974
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,599
um ssid and so

1975
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:59,599
you know your radius server really only

1976
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,920
needs to contain a list of identities

1977
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:04,880
and it uses those against dns to pull

1978
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,639
the public key to uh to authenticate the

1979
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,239
device as opposed to having to manage a

1980
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:09,760
certificate authority

1981
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:11,280
the challenges that come with the

1982
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,000
subjective naming that can come along

1983
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:15,599
with that

1984
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:20,480
this um this we think

1985
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:24,719
really cleans up uh the use of uh

1986
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:25,280
eeptls and can lead to wider adoption of

1987
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,239
uh

1988
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,840
x.509 based authentication for network

1989
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:32,718
access

1990
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,800
and it also makes this the support for

1991
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,320
raw public keys in that case a little

1992
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,440
simpler too

1993
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,960
uh raw public keys um you know which is

1994
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:43,759
essentially a certificate

1995
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,440
with all of this stuff like the issuer

1996
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,280
information the issuer's

1997
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,638
signature the entity name and everything

1998
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,960
else stripped out of it

1999
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:52,320
it's just a public key so it doesn't

2000
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,159
bear all that other metadata that's

2001
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:57,440
oftentimes used to correlate

2002
01:23:54,159 --> 01:24:01,120
you know with the named identity and

2003
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:02,960
using dns to host those raw public keys

2004
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,880
takes the burden off of the network

2005
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,840
administrator or the radius server to

2006
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,120
correlate

2007
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,159
the name with the uh the public key so

2008
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:15,440
we think this this

2009
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:17,199
simplifies that as well next slide

2010
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,719
ash please just gonna interrupt you

2011
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,559
quickly just to uh

2012
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,159
let you know you have around 10 minutes

2013
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:24,000
left and i

2014
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:26,080
i suggest we move quickly to the

2015
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,080
discussion part which is

2016
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:30,159
most interesting to to get to the

2017
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:34,800
dispatch outcome

2018
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:34,799
certainly all right um

2019
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:38,480
the uh the transport authentication

2020
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,440
aspects we've already covered in some

2021
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,199
detail

2022
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:43,120
and that's just being able to do mutual

2023
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:46,239
authentication between two entities

2024
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:48,480
regardless of the the

2025
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:49,280
certificate authority this we think

2026
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:53,199
works pretty well

2027
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:55,199
with multicast dns

2028
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,559
as a companion technology multicast dns

2029
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,400
gives us the ability to

2030
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,320
you know dns service discovery on a

2031
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:01,679
local network to announce

2032
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,440
this is the service i'm providing this

2033
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,719
is my identity the identity can then be

2034
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,400
confirmed

2035
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:10,840
using dane and the public dns um

2036
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,360
you know as a part of that process for

2037
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:15,679
authentication

2038
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,639
and then you can very simply describe

2039
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,960
trust as

2040
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,400
you know this device may act as a client

2041
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:22,639
with this server

2042
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,799
it can be objectively interpreted it can

2043
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,760
be interpreted by humans audited

2044
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,800
just becomes a lot easier to you know to

2045
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,960
understand and to

2046
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:34,480
parse policies from a machine and human

2047
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,480
aspect next slide please

2048
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,320
object security and i'll go into more

2049
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,480
detail on this in a little bit

2050
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:46,080
um you know the challenge one of the

2051
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,440
biggest challenges with object security

2052
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,760
is getting

2053
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,120
the certificate to the authenticating

2054
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,120
party

2055
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,159
and then also getting the you know the

2056
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:56,080
public key to

2057
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:57,759
the sender if you're trying to do

2058
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,960
end-to-end encryption

2059
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:02,639
so using dns as that certificate or

2060
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,960
public key discovery mechanism

2061
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,520
really simplifies that and again you get

2062
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,080
the benefit of working across

2063
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,040
cas and then policy in this case can be

2064
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:13,440
described as

2065
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,719
you know cinder may use middleware to

2066
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,440
reach recipient it starts to look a

2067
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:22,080
little bit like

2068
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:25,040
a policy route next slide please

2069
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:27,360
uh life with dane uh we think that uh

2070
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:30,080
identity suppliers will be able to

2071
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:32,559
um to ship more useful identities and

2072
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:36,080
this could be in the form of sim cards

2073
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:38,639
you know or uicc's um

2074
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,400
you know even you know tpm's trusted

2075
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,840
platform modules things like that

2076
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:47,839
uh can have uh identities that are

2077
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,760
uh authenticatable using dns um

2078
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,880
you know as soon as they're plugged into

2079
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,880
the device

2080
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,320
and then implementers get the benefit of

2081
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,360
being able to roll these devices out

2082
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:56,960
more quickly

2083
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:58,639
uh without having to re-key to

2084
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,280
enterprise pki

2085
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,840
and application owners can get the

2086
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,719
benefit

2087
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,719
of a standardized application or um

2088
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:09,120
authentication protocol

2089
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:11,440
um and hopefully this will lead to a

2090
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:13,519
state in the ecosystem where

2091
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:16,320
um where you can choose best of breed

2092
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,920
components uh you don't always get

2093
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,679
you know sometimes you have to buy your

2094
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:21,679
imaging devices

2095
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:23,360
from the same company that produces the

2096
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,600
software you use for computer vision

2097
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,639
and they're not always good at both you

2098
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,400
just kind of have to figure out which

2099
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,400
one's more important and go with that

2100
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:33,120
we're hoping that this opens it up for

2101
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,719
um for application owners to pick best

2102
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,199
of breed equipment too

2103
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:37,199
next slide

2104
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:44,559
current work centers around using dane

2105
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,880
for mutual tls

2106
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,639
we think that you know beyond mutual tls

2107
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,840
there's uh there might be a benefit in

2108
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:53,760
oauth 2

2109
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:57,040
which supports mutual tls um and eat tls

2110
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,840
we think that that may uh

2111
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:02,400
that may work with little or no

2112
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,400
modification once the

2113
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:08,159
once the tls library supports the use of

2114
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,880
dane client certificates

2115
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,879
next slide please

2116
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,120
upcoming work uh using dane specifically

2117
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,440
for certificate discovery across

2118
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,719
uh decoupled applications this is

2119
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:24,960
something we refer to

2120
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:26,400
as dain light uses tstls the tlsa record

2121
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,320
to represent the certificate

2122
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:29,599
and still uses pkix to authenticate the

2123
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,320
certificate

2124
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,199
um and we would we would propose this as

2125
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,920
a separate

2126
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:37,360
and very focused use case um with a

2127
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,719
different certificate usage

2128
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:42,400
mode called pcxcd the ultimate goal we

2129
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:46,320
want dns sec everywhere

2130
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:49,920
but because dns sec adoption is so

2131
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:52,159
so sparse that's that's an inhibitor to

2132
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,239
adoption for this so we think that using

2133
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:56,239
it like this we can still

2134
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:58,559
safely use the record and authenticate

2135
01:28:56,239 --> 01:29:01,519
what's coming across

2136
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,480
and incentivize the use of or the

2137
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,040
further adoption

2138
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,799
of dns sect down the road because if you

2139
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,519
can use

2140
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,199
the tlsa record specifically for

2141
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,400
authenticating messages in a decoupled

2142
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,919
application

2143
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,080
wouldn't it be really nice if you could

2144
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,040
just use that for mutual

2145
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,400
uh mutual tls authentication well then

2146
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:24,639
that then it becomes

2147
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:26,960
a simplification and there's a usability

2148
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:29,920
benefit to adopting dns sec

2149
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:32,000
beyond the security benefits and you can

2150
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:35,120
then turn dns sec on and you can start

2151
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,120
migrating these over to

2152
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:41,360
the cert usage of uh you know one or

2153
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,760
three or whatever

2154
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,559
so i realize that we have covered an

2155
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:47,920
awful lot

2156
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:51,280
um and i think we can kick to

2157
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,920
the uh you know i guess the question

2158
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:56,880
you know now is how should the uh you

2159
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,480
know how should the work continue

2160
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:04,400
and um you know should this

2161
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:04,718
land with the tls uh group with uta dns

2162
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,960
op

2163
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,320
or is there a better working group this

2164
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,520
could land with

2165
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:14,239
and and now is a

2166
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,840
probably a pretty good time for q a good

2167
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:20,320
time to start a discussion

2168
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,679
richard did you want to say

2169
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:24,320
no i was just going to say the same

2170
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:24,320
thing you just said

2171
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:31,199
good uh there is some discussion in

2172
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:36,719
in jabber going on which have been okay

2173
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:36,719
phil go ahead let's try this

2174
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:42,000
it's working yes yes

2175
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,280
no i can't hear you

2176
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,639
was working and then he stopped working

2177
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,159
phil can't hear you

2178
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,480
i can't hear you either

2179
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:08,239
no it's not working

2180
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:13,599
um elliot went into the queue

2181
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:19,679
yeah please should i go ahead

2182
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,760
do you want me to go ahead yes go ahead

2183
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:27,840
okay yeah we're having this pretty

2184
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:29,280
lengthy discussion in the chat uh phil

2185
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,800
we can't hear you so just

2186
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:34,239
just bear with you bear with us but um

2187
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:37,040
you know there's there's a couple things

2188
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:39,839
tied together here um

2189
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:42,000
i suspect uh people need to understand

2190
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,239
quite a bit more about this proposal

2191
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,199
and before before it goes forward for

2192
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:46,799
one thing

2193
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,638
i have lots of questions about

2194
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,120
dependencies uh

2195
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,239
relating to it um it's interesting but

2196
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,080
it's also one

2197
01:31:52,239 --> 01:32:00,000
of something close to a half dozen

2198
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:03,040
similar mechanisms uh that each uh

2199
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,760
offers a slightly different claim so we

2200
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,600
probably need to

2201
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,440
consolidate those discussions a little

2202
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,280
bit um

2203
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:12,000
maybe the thing to do is to push it into

2204
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:15,280
a boss maybe the thing to do

2205
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:18,960
is to uh bring it into the the

2206
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:20,800
uh pondered iot ops group for discussion

2207
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,000
and then dispatch from there with these

2208
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,080
other mechanisms

2209
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,600
uh those were the thoughts from i think

2210
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:27,840
i mentioned some of that in the chat

2211
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:30,080
i'm not sure uh what other people think

2212
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,960
but at least the idea is worth pursuing

2213
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,519
a little bit

2214
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,719
to to clarify what claims are are being

2215
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:36,239
offered what

2216
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,679
what environments can work and what

2217
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,638
environments it can't work and how does

2218
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:40,560
it compare to the other

2219
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,239
mechanisms that are being put forward we

2220
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,960
did have a little bit of these sorts of

2221
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:45,678
discussions

2222
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,199
in the side meetings for onboarding but

2223
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,480
we haven't really carried those forward

2224
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:49,678
and maybe we should

2225
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,759
because there are also a bunch of

2226
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:52,560
mechanisms outside of the iatf that we

2227
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,080
need to

2228
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:55,760
view in this context especially in the

2229
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:57,600
context of iot

2230
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:59,040
thanks for letting me blather on a

2231
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:01,760
little along here

2232
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:03,519
so elliot is uh iot ops is that a

2233
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,280
existing working group or a proposed

2234
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:06,880
proposed one and is that where you were

2235
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,040
proposing to have the discussion

2236
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,320
yeah it's proposed and and we have to

2237
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:13,679
run it by rob wilton

2238
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:15,759
and you know maybe that we should um

2239
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,880
you know have that conversation you know

2240
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,800
as time goes on

2241
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,159
i'm not sure how you want to handle the

2242
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:24,080
dispatch here though

2243
01:33:20,159 --> 01:33:24,080
i realize that timing is not perfect

2244
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:36,719
okay thanks elliot anybody else who

2245
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:39,040
wants to come to the mic

2246
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:39,040
no

2247
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,360
um

2248
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:54,320
okay so i

2249
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,760
i heard go ahead richard

2250
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,199
yeah i think i was going to go in the

2251
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,520
same direction you were and try and kind

2252
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,120
of

2253
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,480
start summarizing based on the

2254
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:04,239
discussion on the audio and the chat

2255
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:07,678
oh we have one one last person thank you

2256
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,678
roberto did you want to say something

2257
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:21,040
uh i guess not so um

2258
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,960
yeah roberto feel free to turn on your

2259
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:26,159
audio if you can get that working

2260
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,679
um so i was going to try and summarize

2261
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:29,199
it sounds like based on the discussion

2262
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:30,400
in the audio channel here and on the

2263
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:33,199
chat

2264
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:35,519
that um there's a fair bit more sorting

2265
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,638
to do here um so this might be uh best

2266
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,360
suited for a

2267
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:40,800
full up off um to as early as pointed

2268
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:43,040
out collect some related work

2269
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,840
and and get a more uh holistic view to

2270
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:46,480
this

2271
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:47,600
uh before we uh charter up a specific

2272
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,839
solution

2273
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:53,440
so i i would put that forward as kind of

2274
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,440
a proposed resolution for this one

2275
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:02,480
anybody's strong objections to both

2276
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:02,480
is there a discussion list

2277
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,520
and yeah i was going to say that that

2278
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,880
would be another another precursor we

2279
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,719
could do is set up a mailing list to

2280
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:12,560
discuss these sort of um

2281
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:14,880
authentication uh requirements

2282
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,840
so eliot is suggesting this iot

2283
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:21,040
onboarding

2284
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:23,280
analyst so that sounds good

2285
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,239
okay that's that's an existing mailing

2286
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:27,840
list or where

2287
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:31,759
you're proposing that okay

2288
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:34,320
steven go ahead so i wasn't clear what

2289
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:43,280
the topic of the buff richard was

2290
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:45,679
imagining what would be

2291
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,960
i i would probably defer to other folks

2292
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:47,920
with a little more expertise in me here

2293
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,080
but i would i

2294
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,679
it sounds like folks had in mind um

2295
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,480
something slightly broader than just

2296
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:55,840
this topic

2297
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:59,440
i'm covering some um

2298
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,760
uh slightly uh broader

2299
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:03,839
frontier of uh different iot

2300
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,679
authentication and identity provisioning

2301
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,840
technologies that are out there

2302
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:11,280
but i see elliot in the queue now so go

2303
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:13,600
ahead

2304
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,559
yep you you you just said it pretty much

2305
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:17,440
there richard

2306
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,320
um which is uh we should look at this

2307
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:21,440
mechanism

2308
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,400
we should look i think at uh the

2309
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,678
mechanism

2310
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:29,040
that uh

2311
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:33,119
dan harkins and um

2312
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:36,639
uh and our colleague from from malaysia

2313
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:39,199
have put together which is a tls pok

2314
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,480
draft which is related there's t work

2315
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:42,559
that's related

2316
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,559
and of course there's all the anima ace

2317
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,920
work that that needs to be considered as

2318
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,080
well and i think

2319
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:53,840
you might have some related work as well

2320
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:53,840
if i understand correctly

2321
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:07,600
um so michael was writing in the chat

2322
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:12,000
i think you is probably richard yes

2323
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:14,400
um no non-working group forming buff

2324
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,920
i i don't know if we discussed the the

2325
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:21,839
non-working group forming or

2326
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:21,840
working part of it

2327
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,600
any opinions

2328
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:36,480
ted or roman roman go ahead

2329
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:38,080
so i was going to say i think

2330
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:39,280
non-working group forming is probably

2331
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,639
right at this stage

2332
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,000
because one of the biggest problems you

2333
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:44,239
actually have is how do you get unique

2334
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,199
names to these devices that are

2335
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:48,239
usable in this context for the people

2336
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:51,040
who want to identify

2337
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:52,320
them and i think both phil and and ecker

2338
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:53,199
kind of laid out in the chat good

2339
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,480
reasons

2340
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:59,119
why the names they're commonly

2341
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,959
known by simply won't work here and so i

2342
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:02,880
think without that framing discussion

2343
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,000
first going into the methods isn't going

2344
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,920
to help a lot

2345
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,199
because you're arguing about the utility

2346
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:10,159
of something

2347
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:11,519
attaching a trust anchor to a name that

2348
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:13,759
isn't unique

2349
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,880
and that's really problematic in all

2350
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:17,920
bunch of ways

2351
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,840
so i think a a non-working group forming

2352
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,040
off that that took a bigger framing

2353
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,960
question and then

2354
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:24,239
invited people in to describe why their

2355
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,159
solutions

2356
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:28,159
took their views of it would would be

2357
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:31,839
more useful to make

2358
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:33,679
progress here thanks

2359
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,040
yes thanks for that comment ted so i

2360
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:39,520
think um

2361
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:41,519
uh we uh are expecting the names

2362
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:43,840
to be unique so there's there's a

2363
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:47,119
provisioning process by which

2364
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,679
unique names are deployed on the

2365
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:50,960
on on the devices i don't know if ash's

2366
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,840
presentation

2367
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,440
touched on that but um that is at least

2368
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:59,840
our expectation

2369
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:59,839
yes that's correct

2370
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,480
so i think that is your expectation but

2371
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,879
i think the huge number of these devices

2372
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:08,159
that

2373
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:12,000
expectation would not be met okay

2374
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:13,839
correct stop this discussion here uh

2375
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,440
but i i think roman wanted to say

2376
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,760
something before i don't know

2377
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:17,759
roman

2378
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,280
r d

2379
01:39:25,199 --> 01:39:29,519
if not um

2380
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:35,679
i think roman i lost uh lost mytico

2381
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:41,840
connectivity i don't know if uh and ben

2382
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:41,840
cadek is on the line it's our other id

2383
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:53,119
a super clear outcome but i agree that

2384
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,960
there's

2385
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:56,320
a lot of things going on in this space

2386
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,600
and

2387
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:02,400
um at least i don't have a great

2388
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,639
understanding of even the scope of the

2389
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:07,599
work that was presented here

2390
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,639
so it's definitely in a you further

2391
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,679
discussion

2392
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:16,719
whether that's an email list or

2393
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:21,280
off i don't have a great picture myself

2394
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:25,440
okay so i would say the conclusion from

2395
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:26,400
both um next up is both and continuing

2396
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:30,719
the discussion

2397
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:30,719
in mailing list proposal was

2398
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:37,840
too high on the chat

2399
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:48,880
um someone can someone post uh

2400
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,879
what mailing list was again

2401
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:55,360
it was an iot ops but

2402
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:57,519
iot onboarding thank you thank you

2403
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,559
um so we discussed we continued

2404
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:05,040
discussion there

2405
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:08,400
um waiting the buff

2406
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:10,560
opinion there as well and

2407
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:12,159
thank you ash and schumann for

2408
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,320
presenting

2409
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:15,599
uh yeah thanks can i just ask one quick

2410
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,239
question before

2411
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:20,159
we move on go ahead so the we'll start

2412
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,119
the discussion on the iot onboarding

2413
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:24,638
list

2414
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:25,199
and then the proposal uh to submit a

2415
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:27,679
buff

2416
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:29,599
would be if i understood elliott's

2417
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,199
suggestion correctly earlier was to

2418
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:34,719
cover the dane for

2419
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:37,919
iot topic as well as a set of related

2420
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:41,119
uh protocols that intersect in this

2421
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:41,840
area right so if i could ask elliot to

2422
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,440
summarize

2423
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:46,560
the set of things that he mentioned the

2424
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,879
related technologies and protocols

2425
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:51,119
uh maybe an email to the sector

2426
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:54,159
specialist that would be good

2427
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:55,599
this is a good point to to remind

2428
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,879
everybody that

2429
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:01,440
in this working group we actually

2430
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:03,600
dispatched the work

2431
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,599
to

2432
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:10,239
whatever dispatching outcome we

2433
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:13,760
recommended is actually

2434
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:15,519
done so um you can always

2435
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:17,199
come to the chairs too for more

2436
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,800
indication of what that meant

2437
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:29,040
but yes let's take it off this offline

2438
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:32,239
okay great thank you thank you next time

2439
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,239
all right i'm um

2440
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,119
trying to share my screen here

2441
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:45,360
and nice to see you as well great

2442
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,400
so you have my screen yes we can see the

2443
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,759
slides

2444
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,920
good so thank you for the opportunity to

2445
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,119
uh present the signature validation

2446
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:54,960
token um

2447
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:56,159
as we mentioned at the beginning of the

2448
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:59,600
meeting this

2449
01:42:56,159 --> 01:43:01,360
item was briefly uh presented and

2450
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:03,440
discussed at the security dispatch

2451
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:05,119
knight f107

2452
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,919
one of the news here is on the first

2453
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:09,040
slide is that russ housley has joined me

2454
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,080
as an editor

2455
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:14,080
for the isdf drafts that are actually

2456
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,519
now posted to the itf we have three

2457
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:19,360
drafts

2458
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:22,840
on this and so let me go through

2459
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:25,440
quickly and briefly the goal of this

2460
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:27,440
work is to provide

2461
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,919
a simple solution for a validating

2462
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:32,320
signature in the distant future

2463
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,760
this is an area where there is a great

2464
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:37,519
need and also

2465
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:40,159
a great potential of doing something

2466
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:43,040
that is not available through current

2467
01:43:40,159 --> 01:43:43,040
solutions today

2468
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:46,799
um the history of this work is that it

2469
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,480
started

2470
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,840
up as a swedish government-funded

2471
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,119
research project for

2472
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,040
archival of electronic signature what do

2473
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:57,360
we need to do in order to have effective

2474
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,920
archiving of electronic documents

2475
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,239
um there's a huge potential savings in

2476
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,800
be able to do that

2477
01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,879
this work got adopted by the swedish

2478
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:10,159
agency for digital government and

2479
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:12,080
now is a first standard for how to do

2480
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:14,000
this officially in swedish government

2481
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:16,320
work

2482
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,560
it has been developed in a public

2483
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:21,679
available open source

2484
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,520
and it has gone into production also in

2485
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,199
the education service i will talk a

2486
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,199
little bit more about that

2487
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:29,440
uh it's a signing service for the

2488
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:32,239
swedish education and the violence

2489
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,719
and and for the school systems in sweden

2490
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:35,440
and

2491
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:37,520
uh now we're approaching this in the itf

2492
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:37,919
for standardization not rubber stamping

2493
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,320
but

2494
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:41,040
we have a version 1.0 of the protocol

2495
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,159
and

2496
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:45,040
we would like to develop for 1.1 within

2497
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:48,960
the iitf

2498
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:51,519
to have itf uh full in in control of

2499
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:54,639
what happens and change control of that

2500
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:56,080
next version of the protocol and the

2501
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,679
important requirements

2502
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,600
that should be satisfied with the

2503
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,679
solution is first of all

2504
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,760
there are solutions that do not

2505
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,639
integrity protect the document that they

2506
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,199
are being

2507
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,800
protected here but this solution needs

2508
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:11,199
to fully integrity protect

2509
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:12,719
so that if anything changes in the

2510
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:15,360
document that's been archived

2511
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,000
when you pull it off this evidence

2512
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,559
should not work

2513
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:19,840
anymore you need to be easy to implement

2514
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,400
uh there is a great

2515
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,480
need for simplicity here we need

2516
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,759
absolutely predictable outcome this is

2517
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:27,919
nothing that is not

2518
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,800
currently provided by current solutions

2519
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,400
if you

2520
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:32,080
validate the signature today and you

2521
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,679
archive it and you pull it out ten years

2522
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,559
from now you might come to a different

2523
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,719
conclusions

2524
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,639
just following the validation procedures

2525
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:41,040
because some external

2526
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,639
information has or or condition have

2527
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:45,280
changed

2528
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:48,320
we want to avoid size explosion and

2529
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:51,840
especially cascading evidence collection

2530
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:53,519
um signatures are supported by external

2531
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,639
evidence and when you have

2532
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,639
external evidence that require

2533
01:45:56,639 --> 01:46:00,960
another piece of external evidence and

2534
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:03,119
that requires another piece of external

2535
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:06,080
evidence you get a cascading effect

2536
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:08,159
that we need to avoid um we want to

2537
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:10,559
avoid repeated storage of lars calmly

2538
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:12,879
validation objects if you're storing 100

2539
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,639
000 documents and all needs support over

2540
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:17,280
50 megabytes crl

2541
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:19,760
then storing that 15 megabyte crl in

2542
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:23,360
each of those 100 000

2543
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:26,080
documents is not very efficient um

2544
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,480
we want to provide fast verification and

2545
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,600
then

2546
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:30,400
more importantly it should all work

2547
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,440
offline

2548
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,320
not because we don't foresee an online

2549
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:37,040
capability

2550
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,920
in the future but anything that needs to

2551
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,920
be available

2552
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,280
online might not be available in the

2553
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:43,199
future

2554
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:45,360
and it must be compatible with current

2555
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:47,360
document parsers a signature validation

2556
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:52,000
software it should not interfere

2557
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:53,599
with processing these documents

2558
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,080
in any software that doesn't know

2559
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:59,679
anything about the solution

2560
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:03,600
um it is up and running in in production

2561
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:06,719
version 1.0 in edusign which is a

2562
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,440
solution provided by zoonet levieux and

2563
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:09,679
son

2564
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,799
that is well known here at the itf is

2565
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:12,880
handling this uh

2566
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,560
service and you're free to approach him

2567
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:17,440
about the the choice to

2568
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,960
to use this and this is used to ensure

2569
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:19,678
that everything that is signed in

2570
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:22,159
edusign

2571
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,760
can be archived and be validated in the

2572
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:26,480
future which is a

2573
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,400
key feature that is required by the

2574
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:30,879
educational system in order to use the

2575
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:33,679
solution

2576
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,280
um this is not different using the

2577
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,800
signature validation token is not

2578
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,920
different from any other signature

2579
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:41,360
validation because

2580
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:43,280
they all require some sort of external

2581
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:46,559
evidence no

2582
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:49,599
sign document solution can

2583
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,159
validate signature in a self-sufficient

2584
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,840
manner

2585
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:56,960
um in the easiest case where the

2586
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,679
signature certificate still is valid uh

2587
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:01,119
i still need to know is the signature

2588
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:03,600
not revoked or not

2589
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:05,040
and if this is revoked i also need a

2590
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:07,440
time

2591
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,320
when the signature was created before it

2592
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,960
was revoked

2593
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,480
or not in order to do signature

2594
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,719
validation even

2595
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,519
documents where the certificate is valid

2596
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,639
after this

2597
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:20,800
certificate expires

2598
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:23,440
i need to know a time when the signature

2599
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,719
existed and i need to know the validity

2600
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:28,080
status of that

2601
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:30,159
of the certificate at that time

2602
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:32,960
then when the algorithms are no longer

2603
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:34,159
trusted or if the key has been exposed

2604
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,639
or anything like that

2605
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:38,799
i need more information i need still a

2606
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:42,320
time where the signature existed

2607
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:46,000
i need the validity status of that time

2608
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:48,159
of certificates and other

2609
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,119
and i need the data that it was actually

2610
01:48:48,159 --> 01:48:52,159
assigned because

2611
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:53,599
i could have altered that signed

2612
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,599
document that made that fit the

2613
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,679
signature so i need to know

2614
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:58,639
actually what data that was signed at

2615
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:00,560
the time

2616
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,800
and i need to know all the certificates

2617
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,199
that were used and it would help also

2618
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,880
know

2619
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:09,119
to know results of prior validations

2620
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,000
and one of the problems with current

2621
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:12,880
approaches is

2622
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:14,159
the cascading evidence collection and

2623
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,639
that is the main

2624
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:17,759
area of improvement where we're trying

2625
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:21,119
to fix with this

2626
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,679
approach in the currency situation i

2627
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:25,839
tried to validate the signature and that

2628
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,719
signature is supported by cert and that

2629
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:29,280
cert is

2630
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:32,400
supported by chain and to validate that

2631
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:35,840
chain i need to support by lcsp tokens

2632
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:37,839
that is supported by cert and that ca

2633
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:40,880
cert is supported by crl

2634
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,040
and then in order to know a time when

2635
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:45,199
this was valid in case something happens

2636
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,880
i need a time stamp and i have the same

2637
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:48,879
problem with cascading evidence

2638
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:54,320
and they all end up in a trust anchor

2639
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,480
and i may know if that trust anchor is

2640
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,239
trusted today but i may not know in five

2641
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:59,440
years from now if that trust anchor is

2642
01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:02,400
still

2643
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,199
able to be determined to be trusted and

2644
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,839
then

2645
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:06,719
to have the long-term validation i need

2646
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,159
to

2647
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:13,760
timestamp all of this information

2648
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:16,960
by a a a

2649
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,920
we call a a archive time stamp and this

2650
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,159
archive test

2651
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,119
needs to be stored for by supporting

2652
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,440
evidence

2653
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:25,519
and since the time stamping authority

2654
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:27,199
does not see the document or don't know

2655
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:30,080
if anything else is valid

2656
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:32,638
it's only making it a a statement of

2657
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:35,360
this existence existed at a certain

2658
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:35,920
point in time and if you need new

2659
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:37,759
evidence

2660
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:40,480
you need to create a new archive

2661
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:42,719
timestamps that includes the first one

2662
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,919
the problem here is that any piece of

2663
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:47,119
evidence that is not

2664
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:49,280
valid in 10 years from now will destroy

2665
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:50,799
the whole chain of evidence this is not

2666
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:54,159
like i have

2667
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:54,800
100 parallel sources of evidence i have

2668
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:57,679
100

2669
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,119
serial points of evidence in anything

2670
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:01,520
that is not

2671
01:50:59,119 --> 01:51:03,199
verifiable tomorrow breaks the whole

2672
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:06,719
chain of evidence

2673
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:10,719
so the idea is to reduce this and

2674
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:13,679
to replace the cascading evidence

2675
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:14,159
with one piece of evidence uh in order

2676
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,920
to

2677
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:17,199
increase the predictability of the

2678
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,400
outcome and and

2679
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:21,759
removing its complexity and that

2680
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:23,759
is replaced with the signature

2681
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,000
validation token and the signature

2682
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,040
validation token put everything in one

2683
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,520
evidence

2684
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:31,280
and you collect the signature validation

2685
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:34,480
token when everything is fresh

2686
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:36,960
and can be checked in current time so

2687
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,759
the token includes information about

2688
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:40,159
whose issue

2689
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,920
the time of issues the algorithms used

2690
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:44,080
to create this token

2691
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,159
if there is an expire of the token and

2692
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:47,280
then it has a hash of an assigned

2693
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:50,320
document it have

2694
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:50,719
hashes over the signed attributes which

2695
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,880
is

2696
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:55,040
like signed attributes in cms or

2697
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:57,280
assigned info in xml

2698
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:58,960
it has a hash over the signature value

2699
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:00,320
and the hash of the certificates that

2700
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,159
were validated

2701
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,679
then we can add information about

2702
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:06,960
verified times

2703
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:07,360
that we have verified and how we verify

2704
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:10,080
them

2705
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,880
and also we can include the results the

2706
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,440
new now

2707
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,679
how we use this is that it's free for

2708
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,000
the validator to use whatever part of

2709
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:18,400
this

2710
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,440
evidence you feel are necessary you can

2711
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:21,119
use only

2712
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:22,638
the claim that the certificates were

2713
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:25,040
valid and

2714
01:52:22,639 --> 01:52:25,920
validate the signature while it can be

2715
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,239
validated

2716
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:30,480
but you can also choose to rely on the

2717
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:34,080
whole conclusion here

2718
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:36,000
but you can essentially replace the need

2719
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:37,360
for all the cascading evidence with one

2720
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,800
piece of evidence

2721
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:44,239
it's very time space efficient

2722
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:47,520
i'm sorry it's spacious space efficient

2723
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:49,519
so this is the example of of the format

2724
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:51,199
with compressed information if you show

2725
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:54,159
this how this looks

2726
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:54,960
live in xml it doesn't take very much

2727
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:57,839
space

2728
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,480
it's extremely much time space efficient

2729
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,880
than

2730
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:01,919
for example storing crls and ocsp

2731
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:04,080
responses and

2732
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:07,199
certificates of all cascading evidence

2733
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:07,199
in a signature

2734
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:13,040
the validation process is pretty simple

2735
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:15,360
you look at the document if it has a

2736
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,960
validation token you validate that if it

2737
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,880
doesn't have a token or you can't

2738
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,599
recognize the token you go to

2739
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:23,199
the traditional validation process you

2740
01:53:21,599 --> 01:53:24,880
come up with a solution

2741
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:27,199
and in the validation you choose

2742
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,440
whatever you think you want to use

2743
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:30,799
from the supporting evidence in the

2744
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:34,159
validation token

2745
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,840
in order to do this if i just

2746
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:37,519
sorry to interrupt that you have two

2747
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,440
minutes left

2748
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:45,360
okay um so basically we have

2749
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:49,678
profiles for pdf xml and jobs

2750
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:53,040
and we have um drafts on the internet

2751
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:56,639
uh we have open source available

2752
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:59,280
and we have a

2753
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:59,840
test site where you can test update and

2754
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:04,159
update

2755
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:05,840
upload any european validated

2756
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:07,519
signatures or qualified electronic

2757
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,679
signatures

2758
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,520
and you can download this document with

2759
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:13,520
a validation token

2760
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,960
and once you're validated you can

2761
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,199
revalidate it with the

2762
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,080
signature validation token enhanced

2763
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,839
process

2764
01:54:18,080 --> 01:54:21,199
and if you look at this in the pdf

2765
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:22,880
processor you will see that the

2766
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:25,119
signature validation token

2767
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:26,639
appears here just as another document

2768
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:29,920
timestamp

2769
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:32,960
um the iitf why is because this

2770
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:36,560
is first of all based on a

2771
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:39,440
jot format that is as a route to the itf

2772
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:40,639
and i have done similar work in the past

2773
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:43,598
and

2774
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:44,000
now we think that lamps because it's

2775
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:46,960
it's

2776
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,239
cms related would fit into the lamps

2777
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,280
working group

2778
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:54,080
to to work on there and um

2779
01:54:51,280 --> 01:54:56,480
questions so that's all i needed to say

2780
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,480
about it

2781
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:05,599
thanks thanks steven um

2782
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:08,718
so comments keeping

2783
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:10,239
so so this this work was dispatched at

2784
01:55:08,719 --> 01:55:12,960
idea format seven with

2785
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:15,519
more the outcome was more need for

2786
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,520
discussion

2787
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,679
and i'd like to hear if people think

2788
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:23,040
that

2789
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:25,280
um things have changed enough

2790
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,080
so i i am hearing that obviously the

2791
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:28,400
authors think

2792
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:29,840
things have changed enough so that there

2793
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:33,519
should be a different

2794
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:35,599
outcome today um

2795
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:37,440
yeah so we don't want to change the

2796
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,599
dispatch

2797
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:41,199
um you know what has been done but we do

2798
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,199
want to hear the feedback

2799
01:55:41,199 --> 01:55:44,320
in case something has changed so if

2800
01:55:43,199 --> 01:55:48,320
people have comments

2801
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:48,320
please come to the mic

2802
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:59,040
and also there is a lot going on in the

2803
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:59,040
chat so

2804
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:02,320
either people in the chat come forward

2805
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,280
uh

2806
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:05,280
roberto go ahead

2807
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:14,080
thing in the chat so far has um you know

2808
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,679
said anything that suggests

2809
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:18,159
a specific working group or anything

2810
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:22,000
along those lines

2811
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:25,119
so can you hear me yes

2812
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:28,639
oh thanks uh um

2813
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:31,679
roberto i know that there are some

2814
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:35,360
other organizations in europe that are

2815
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:39,920
trying to standardize a json profile

2816
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:39,920
for storing signatures just like

2817
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:47,598
ei das profiles for jason

2818
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:51,760
and something i saw before

2819
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:55,040
was quite similar of what was presented

2820
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:58,330
and i was guessing if you had

2821
01:56:55,040 --> 01:57:00,719
any um

2822
01:56:58,330 --> 01:57:05,599
[Music]

2823
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:09,040
talk with them or if you managed to

2824
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:12,480
put in your specification all the ideas

2825
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:16,080
requirements i think that

2826
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:18,000
this work is interesting and i will be

2827
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:22,719
interested to talk

2828
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:25,199
whether it makes it into the idf or not

2829
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:25,760
i could i could answer that uh very well

2830
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:28,879
uh

2831
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:32,320
the the work done in cesi

2832
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,440
is is another type of it's not this kind

2833
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:35,360
of solution but it's

2834
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:37,440
it's another type where you include all

2835
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:40,000
that cascading evidence in the signature

2836
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:42,080
they all have that for pdf and that is

2837
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,440
completely complementary to this work

2838
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:46,480
you can use

2839
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:49,280
that kind of cascading evidence into

2840
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:51,519
doing the conclusion of creating a

2841
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:55,199
signature validation token

2842
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:57,119
so there is no conflict here they do

2843
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:58,638
standards how to include cascading

2844
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:01,759
evidence in a document

2845
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:05,199
and this is another approach

2846
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:08,320
and this is completely compatible with

2847
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:11,678
anything that is designed in the itis

2848
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:14,799
there is no preference in the items how

2849
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:17,040
long-term validation should be done

2850
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:20,400
okay really quickly hank we have two

2851
01:58:17,040 --> 01:58:23,679
minutes left

2852
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:23,679
okay uh smelly fun

2853
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:28,800
go ahead okay thank you so i hope i hope

2854
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:31,919
you

2855
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:34,000
can hear me um so i i i

2856
01:58:31,920 --> 01:58:35,840
really like this work it's uh basically

2857
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,400
offloading the burden of

2858
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:39,280
appraisal of old stuff to a another

2859
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,920
entity

2860
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:44,000
now you can trust this entity my

2861
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,199
question is you're using tokens here and

2862
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,360
i have to admit i

2863
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:48,320
i fast read the document but i did not

2864
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,759
find it

2865
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:52,000
how long is this are these tokens

2866
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,599
supposed to live is it like a service

2867
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,599
you can request them if you

2868
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,119
receive something old or is it like a

2869
01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:00,840
substitute and it

2870
01:58:57,119 --> 01:59:02,559
lasts for years because token too big or

2871
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:04,880
short-lived

2872
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:07,119
so that's a that's a policy decision but

2873
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:10,080
they are not assumed to ever expire

2874
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:12,080
because this statement they do never

2875
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:14,239
expires the statement is

2876
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:16,000
this is what i checked and this is the

2877
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:18,480
conclusion using this policy

2878
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,119
that i came to and and that is a

2879
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,919
statement that never expires

2880
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:25,679
so you could do an expiration there is

2881
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:27,920
in the standard you could have but you

2882
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:29,840
could also let them live as long as

2883
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:32,159
the crypto that supports them is

2884
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:34,320
supporting them

2885
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:36,239
okay so the uh reliability the

2886
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:37,440
resilience of this service or this

2887
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:40,718
entity is higher

2888
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:44,080
than the substituted uh authority that

2889
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:47,280
was marching for or creating the uh

2890
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:50,320
uh sort of the first hand here yes

2891
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:52,800
so there's a listen you can you can

2892
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:54,960
replace this one you can replace this

2893
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:57,280
one with another one and you can also

2894
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:58,000
replace it with more using different

2895
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,920
algorithms

2896
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,520
if you think that you want to have a

2897
01:59:59,920 --> 02:00:04,560
bigger bet that

2898
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:06,560
this sign with this algorithm will live

2899
02:00:04,560 --> 02:00:09,440
longer than the other one so

2900
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:11,119
so uh but but the validation process is

2901
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,080
exactly the same if you replace this

2902
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:14,400
with the new evidence

2903
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:15,920
in the future okay i would have yeah i

2904
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,598
understand sorry francesca i will stop

2905
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,760
you right now because

2906
02:00:17,599 --> 02:00:25,760
i'm sorry yeah okay yeah thank you hank

2907
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:27,440
so this seems to

2908
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:29,119
been looking at the chat and reading

2909
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:32,400
feedback uh

2910
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:34,000
and uh i i think that the outcome is

2911
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,638
still the same it needs more discussion

2912
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,719
and

2913
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:41,199
what probably not

2914
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:42,159
continue i would need a new working

2915
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:48,000
group

2916
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:48,000
um so i again i recommend

2917
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:54,560
in the dispatch mailing list so

2918
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:56,860
everybody

2919
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:58,080
can join there and

2920
02:00:56,860 --> 02:01:02,400
[Music]

2921
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:06,480
yes let's let's conclude this

2922
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:06,480
presentation and the meeting thank you

2923
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:12,480
stefan i think

2924
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:16,159
uh to summarize let's see

2925
02:01:12,480 --> 02:01:16,159
let's do this real quickly

2926
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:23,519
so for the interoperability architecture

2927
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:25,598
for blockchain gateways

2928
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:27,040
so we have the main list blockchain

2929
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:29,040
interop and

2930
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:31,360
we need more discussion and community

2931
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:34,639
development in that mailing list

2932
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:38,239
for the dain for iot security we

2933
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:42,639
recommend a buff

2934
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:44,799
to discuss more and then

2935
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,800
use iot onboarding mainly list in the

2936
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:50,000
meantime for discussion

2937
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:52,800
and for the svt um

2938
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,960
we still recommend more discussion in

2939
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:58,880
the main list to be created

2940
02:01:54,960 --> 02:02:00,800
and all of these will be of course

2941
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:03,280
confirmed in the sec dispatch mailing

2942
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,199
list and we hope to advertise a

2943
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:07,519
different discussion we'll ask the

2944
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:08,559
different authors to post a thread in

2945
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,920
the menu list

2946
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:15,440
to do so and with that said we are

2947
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:16,320
two minutes over and thank you so much
