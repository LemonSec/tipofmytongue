25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,560
at least one minute we we just think um

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,760
um a little bit of jim shot that

[Music]

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,720
but before we do this silent minute

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,000
i might invite our ad

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
to take a few words

33
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
thank you danielle and it's indeed quite

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,800
a loss to us all

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,200
to lost jim um

36
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,720
jim really was quite an exceptional

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,958
individual and

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,359
that extends of course to the breadth of

39
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,920
his enrollment in the itf

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,400
he's been involved in quite a lot of

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,958
things

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,080
and of course he predates me i've only

43
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
been in the itf

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,319
for about eight years and when i came in

45
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,200
he was already an old hand but he was

46
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,760
definitely

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,200
always willing to offer advice even to

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,239
young fresh faces like i was at the time

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,959
uh i do know his hands were on

50
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,519
many of the foundational rfcs for things

51
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
like

52
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
cms or some of the crypto algorithms and

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,120
i came to rely on him for

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,840
for pique's questions i did get to work

55
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
with him

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
pretty closely during my own time as

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,720
co-chair of ace

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
um and he was sort of a mentor to me

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
during that time

60
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,760
i got to learn more about how the idf

61
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,040
works and got to work on my

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,679
my own skills and then

63
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,319
i was only based co-chair for a few

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,599
months

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,399
before i got promoted to being a.d

66
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,518
but i was still a responsible id for ace

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,840
so i got to

68
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
spend time in the working group and i

69
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,840
got to appreciate

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,519
how much time and energy jim would put

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
into the technology and the documents

72
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,159
just

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
trying to make everything really as good

74
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,760
as it could be

75
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,879
um you know as an ad i got to say to see

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,000
a broader

77
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,879
view a broader appreciation of jim's

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,120
role and all that he did for the itf

79
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,120
i'm still not sure i got a full view of

80
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
what he did for the itf

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
uh because i'm sure there are things

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,120
that he did that i

83
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,440
don't know about but i can definitely

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,720
say

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,560
that his his efforts were not limited to

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
just the security area

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
they were not limited to a class of

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
technology he really was

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,120
quite well-rounded

90
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
and i'm happy to say that i was able to

91
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,680
watch

92
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
jim mentor countless individuals

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,040
in the itf that was another way in which

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,960
he served us all

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
he's helping people you know getting the

96
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,159
technology right and get the

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,520
process details and navigating the uh

98
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,240
the process itself which can be complex

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,039
he was just so incredibly selfless and

100
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,120
generous in his time and his expertise

101
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,159
i certainly relied on him for many

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
things i know

103
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,199
others did as well and you know it's

104
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
sort of

105
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
strange to think that he was just so

106
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520
selfless and so

107
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,759
helpful that the only time that he

108
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
really felt the need to say no i can't

109
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,199
help you right now

110
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,160
was actually at the winery during the

111
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,160
pressing season

112
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
it was just too busy at the winery so he

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,960
couldn't do with the itf

114
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
stuff but uh when that season was over

115
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,440
of course he was

116
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,758
back to being our gym and helping us out

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
and

118
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,720
getting things into place so

119
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,119
i can say i will listen very much i know

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,479
that

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,479
we all will thank you jim

122
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,080

123
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,639
um we we have um we observe um

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,880
one minute of silence and then we will

125
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,840

155
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,319
regarding the the current drafts

156

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,079
received um

182
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,880
it was in working with last call

183
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,920
and we have also the oauth param that is

184
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,200
being um

185
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,560
waiting for some time also

186
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,760
um to me all those drafts seems

187
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,119
ready and we have the last one

188
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
that needs to be complete is the os

189
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
gopro 5

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,839
that has just been updated there is a

191
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,120
working group last call on it

192
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,920
um but as far as i know i haven't seen

193
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,040
any reviews for now so

194
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,839
it would be really appreciated that we

195
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
got

196
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
reviews to avoid the draft to be moved

197
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
forward and then

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,120
be called back for um

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,399
subsequent changes so

200
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,680
i am encouraging encouraging the

201
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,079
co-author and additional persons

202
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,239
to review this draft before we can

203
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,199
submit it to the ahd

204
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
we are waiting for um the security

205
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,680
direct

206
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,680
review so we expect at least one review

207
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:08,839
but we would like more

208
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
um anyone planning to review that

209
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
document

210
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
justin i'm just

211
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:27,200
marco here i'm playing also by monday

212
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:31,120
okay so i haven't heard the first person

213
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,120
christian okay

214
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,000
great and also hi francesca

215
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,519
i just wanted to say um

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,760
that um looking at the diff for whoever

217
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,399
has already reviewed it

218
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,880
um should be enough but diff is not huge

219
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,000
so

220
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:55,120
the review shouldn't take long time

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,160
yeah so the diff is um is is one thing

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
but um

223
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
it would be good that we can ensure the

224
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,800
the document is current

225
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,560
and uh all that so um

226
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,680
i would not discourage anyone to review

227
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,839
the full document

228
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,079
okay so i think um yeah and so we also

229
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,600
have documents in progress

230
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:21,359
so i want is the

231
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:35,839
aif so i don't know if casten wants to

232
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:35,839
say a few words on this one

233
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:53,040
if you are speaking i cannot hear you

234
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,880
yeah it must be a local or hardware mute

235
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,560
that kirsten has on because he shows up

236

or he did he dropped off

238
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:15,040

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,439
do the

250
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,639
the statutes of that document um we had

251
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
a working group last goal

252
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,519
all comments have been addressed and uh

253
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,079
what remains to be addressed is really

254
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,959
to

255
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,959
look at the needs

256
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,399
there are some versions of draft that

257
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,519
raise some

258
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,279
warnings and basically

259
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,760
the there are some informative documents

260
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,800
in the normative section so

261
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,639
it's um it's really

262
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,639
really ready to be sent to the asg

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
um we have another draft which is the

264
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
ace pepsi

265
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,519
profile that has not been updated since

266
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:32,479
the last itf i'm wondering if

267
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
any of the author are willing to say a

268
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,160
few words on

269
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,160
this draft

270
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,079
maybe carson do you want to go ahead

271
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:46,160
first for yeah

272
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,160
so i pressed various buttons here

273
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,040
i don't see you so there are error

274
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
messages

275
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,719
coming from mute echo which are going

276
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,440
away before you have a chance to read

277
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,079
them so

278
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,480
you have no idea what's going on anyway

279
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,599
um

280
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
so aaf um essentially has been stable

281
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
for

282
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,759
for half a decade uh until we recently

283
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,000
added the

284
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:14,480
the idea of inheritance to it

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,480
so i think people haven't really

286
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,079
looked at inheritance a lot

287
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,359
and maybe people haven't implemented

288
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,399
inheritance yet

289
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,880
in the various protocols so i think it

290
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,639
would be useful to get some

291
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,720
uh feedback about that of course we can

292
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
finish this draft without inheritance

293
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
but it sounded like

294
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,320
like a good way to solve various

295
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,758
problems that we were having with

296
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,240
post actions um so plea please have a

297
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,279
look about that

298
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,560
so basically your comment is um

299
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,279
that you're looking for um for review

300
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,518
of the current version of the document

301
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,519
okay

302
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:08,079
okay so yeah oh yeah please francisco um

303
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,480
so that has gone to um

304
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,918
yeah i have been prioritizing the oscar

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,520
profile and the

306
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,120
and and the ac group com stuff um

307
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
which is why it hasn't been update

308
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,239
updated but it's still missing

309
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,839
sections in the document about mqtt so

310
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,839
that's why

311
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,760
that that's what's missing right now

312
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,200
though

313
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,879
okay it's in plan to update this and

314
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,880
collaborate with sigdom to do that

315
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,919
but so i guess that for the next itf we

316
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,559
can expect this draft to be sent to the

317
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,559
isga

318
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,000
um i don't know to the isg but

319
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,720
uh regressed yes and then it depends on

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,320
how much work

321
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,320
there is in the oscar profile and

322
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:04,639
okay okay good

323
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,440
so i propose that we start uh the

324
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
presentation

325
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,640
maybe francesca

326
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,320
we may start with

327
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,360
the group communication i think that i

328
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,360
think that's the first one

329
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:26,720
yes sounds good thank you

330
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,879
um let me send as well

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,880
good morning everyone it's dark outside

332
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,399
so keep provisioning

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,840
for group communication using ace this

334
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
is version 10 that has

335
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,760
and next slide please so

336
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
just a quick recap if you haven't seen

337
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,400
this before

338
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
this

339
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,919
if and

340
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,559
for a group member to join a group

341
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,720
and it uses the ace framework

342
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,799
uh in the first part of the exchange

343
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,840
documentation request response

344
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:23,360
and a token post and then it defines

345
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,840
other operations uh between the client

346
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,760
and the kdc which means key distribution

347
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,799
center

348
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,760
to uh join the group so

349
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,799
in this uh in this figure it's only

350
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,080
about

351
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,679
the group joining request a response but

352
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
there is more operations that are

353
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,559
defined

354
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,160
um yes and after that

355
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,678
the the client can do secure group

356
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,480
communication

357
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,360
so this this document is complemented by

358
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,280
the one that

359
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,399
marco will present later which is about

360
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,000
ac group com

361
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,240
oscor and defines the

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,760
additional information for node to join

363
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,840
an oscar group

364
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,158
so this is a general one that cannot be

365
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,799
implemented by itself

366
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,640
and needs what we call application

367
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,000
profiles

368
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,000
so next slide please

369
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,399
since itf 108 a lot has happened

370
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,200
um we have submitted version nine um

371
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,679
based on a follow-up review from jim

372
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,200
which we discussed at itf on 108

373
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,559
and close uh 24 issues

374
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,120
if i'm not wrong and then also

375
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,559
christian gave us a review thank you for

376
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,918
that christian

377
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,080
and uh we have uh

378
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,520
vanapu requested to be the next version

379
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,559
version 10

380
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,158
based on that based on that review

381
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,000
and you can see the details in the

382
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,000
github next slide please

383
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,240
so the goal for version 10 is

384
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,199
hopefully it may it will make it easier

385
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,240
for

386
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,080
implementers to actually understand and

387
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,760
implement this document

388
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:15,039
so we have added co-op message examples

389
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,799
for all exchanges which i think

390
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,520
was a great idea we should have done it

391
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,480
way earlier

392
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,840
we added example for how to calculate

393
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,840
the input to the signature

394
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,799
we try to remove as much as possible

395
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,039
text

396
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,120
that was duplicated from either the ace

397
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,760
framework or from other sections

398
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,439
of the document and then there was some

399
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,039
minor changes with

400
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,159
or yeah modify the error code if a

401
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,158
client is not a member of the group and

402
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,000
is trying to access resources that are

403
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:55,039
dedicated members

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,039
uh from four zero zero that quest

405
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:03,200
bunch of clarifications

406
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,320
that we made so today i want to talk

407
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,240
about

408
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,720
one issue next slide thank you one issue

409
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,039
that is um about the scope encoding and

410
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
um this came from a comment from

411
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,200
christian again

412
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,799
thank you and um

413
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,600
while we were talking about this we

414
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,158
realized maybe this is a more general

415
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,000
problem that is valid for

416
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,840
a resource server which is supporting

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,679
several profiles

418
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:39,280
or application profiles so

419
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,880
this is the scenario you have a kdp

420
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,158
distribution center

421
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,679
which acts as a resource server for all

422
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,080
the resourcer

423
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,760
resources which are accessible via other

424
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,039
profiles of ace

425
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,120
for example oscar file

426
00:22:53,039 --> 00:23:01,840
so the client sends a post token

427
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,840
um to the kdc and the scope is encoded

428
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
the scope in the token is encoded as a

429
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
sieber byte string

430
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,960
and the question is how does the kdc

431
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,480
know

432
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,919
what what is the actual format of scope

433
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,679
because

434
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,840
um for example in our

435
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,039
ascii group com document it's a siebel

436
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,000
byte string but

437
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,960
it's actually cbr array wrapped in a

438
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,960
seaboard by stream

439
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,679
so how does the kdc know how to actually

440
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,240
parse the scope and

441
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
how does the kt know which profile of

442
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,400
ace

443
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,678
the resource survey is being posted a

444
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,360
token for

445
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:51,039
before being able to access this code

446
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,678
um so

447
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,919
yeah so this this is the problem that we

448
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,919
were

449
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,600
dealing

450
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,840
two or three possible solutions

451
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,120
so the first solution is to solve this

452
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,760
locally

453
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,399
so to prefix the scope with a byte

454
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,240
um and this byte will indicate which

455
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,320
application profile of ace

456
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,559
is being used and um

457
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,360
to make this effective this needs to be

458
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,918
agreed

459
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,000
of course between a resource server and

460
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,520
authorization server

461
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,880
and if the same scope is reused

462
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,440
for several resource servers

463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,159
they need to sync this this value of

464
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,720
this byte

465
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,240
for like for each application profile

466
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
with the authorization server

467
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
another solution could be to actually

468
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,360
register a keyboard tag

469
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,600
one different encoding of scope or

470
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,959
for application profile

471
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,879
this has the drawback that the this will

472
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,080
be longer

473
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,279
prefix local or locally agreed prefix

474
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,120
uh maybe only one byte it depends on

475
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,360
how big of a seaboard tag we would go

476
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
for

477
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:28,159
um so for now we only can

478
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,279
see that we would register a keyboard

479
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,919
tag for

480
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,720
only for the ask group oscar profile

481
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,240
because this is not

482
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,159
the only application profile we have

483
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,159
and but later on we would have one for

484
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,520
each application profile encoding

485
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,279
and the question is is is it too much

486
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,240
to have one keyboard tag for each

487
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,240
application profile

488
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
so again this keyboard tag would

489
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,639
indicate

490
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:01,919
okay this scope is formatted in the way

491
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,919
defined in that draft

492
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,919
and another way that this could also be

493
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,440
done is by registering a new token

494
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:14,720
claim that tells you the encoding

495
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,039
of the scope for that token

496
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,799
so the token itself contains a claim

497
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,158
that

498
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,520
is indicating the format of scope

499
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,640
and this has the same problem

500
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,960
or drawbacks as registering a keyboard

501
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
tag

502
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,419
um i wanted to point out that these

503
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
solutions are not

504
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:44,000
[Music]

505
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,679
in they could be used in parallel

506
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
so we could describe both in our

507
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,200
document so we could reach

508
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,039
the tag and at the same time describing

509
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,640
appendix how

510
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,120
either a prefix or a tag could be used

511
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
and then depending on the applications

512
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,239
uh

513
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,640
the the implementer might want to use

514
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,840
one or the other

515
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,320
but it would give them the opportunity

516
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,000
to to choose

517
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,720
so i i don't know if this was clear

518
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,679
um so does anybody have opponents

519
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
are you asking the working group to

520
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,840
state

521
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,480
some preferences i i understand you go

522
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,320
with the prefix

523
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,159
and well i i think

524
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,360
our proposal would be to actually

525
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,399
allow for both either a prefix

526
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,120
or a tag and then let the

527
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,678
implementers decide if they want to use

528
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,760
either

529
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,000
or both or none in some cases you might

530
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,520
not

531
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,159
need to to to even indicate encoding of

532
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,200
a scope because you already know um

533
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,720
you're only using that

534
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,480
at that type of yeah but i'm asking the

535
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,760
working group to

536
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:08,320
give if they have an idea

537
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,320
an opinion yeah

538
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
yeah i i don't think i understand the

539
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,360
problem yet

540
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,799
um but there is a word on this slide

541
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,399
that makes me

542
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,840
nervous at least the first time it

543
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:27,840
occurs it's about same

544
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:31,039
um so how how do the various parties

545
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,720
find out that that some scope is the

546
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,799
same i think this is the whole problem

547
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,640
we are talking about

548
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,440
um and well

549
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
if if you negotiate a namespace you

550
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,799
essentially

551
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,080
need to have had a namespace in place

552
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,760
already to

553
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
enable that negotiation right

554
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,320
yeah so so how

555
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,159
how how do the resource servers and and

556
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,279
the authorization server

557
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,080
do the the discussion about whether a

558
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,000
scope is the

559
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,439
same or not they already need a

560
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,200
namespace

561
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,480
to to do this in so this bullet would be

562
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,960
in the case where a token same token

563
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,080
is reused with several resource servers

564
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,240
which is the case that

565
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,480
is allowed by by the ace framework it's

566
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,279
so it's described there so it's not only

567
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,120
the same

568
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,200
encoding that is used it's actually the

569
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,959
same exact

570
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,200
value because the

571
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,679
the same exact video doesn't imply same

572
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,679
encoding

573
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,080
so you you you cannot discuss whether

574
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,678
you're using the same discord encoding

575
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,000
by just looking at the values you need

576
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
to

577
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,360
yes the encoding as well so you already

578
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,120
need to

579
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,120
have a namespace for doing that

580
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
yeah and that's that's the assumption

581
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,000
with the prefix

582
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,158
uh solution um

583
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
i

584
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,120
thought about if if you use a prefix and

585
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,760
then

586
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,360
then you need to then you need to think

587
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,679
about that you need to sync your

588
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,320
resource servers and the aes and agree

589
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,320
beforehand

590
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,600
ben has another take on the same thing

591
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,879
so

592
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,760
i shut up now let's see what

593
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
that says there is same in the sense of

594
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,360
knowing what email offline access etc

595
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,039
mean and then there is same in the sense

596
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,639
of knowing that it's encoded as a c

597
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,158
board by string containing the zebra

598
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,279
array containing individual

599
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,279
text strings or whatever

600
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
yes

601
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,200
yeah yeah it requires synchronization

602
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,840
that's how the scope

603
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,840
to use

604
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,039
yeah just to jump in in the audio this

605
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,480
is ben kadek again

606
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,240
so my understanding is that the sort of

607
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,240
knowing what the email and offline

608
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,360
access and what not mean that's

609
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
definitely out of scope um for for this

610
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,479
document

611
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,480
and certainly in the oauth world you

612
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
just have like an out of band agreement

613
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,799
as to what those

614
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,959
mean uh and so we're talking about the

615
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,480
other one

616
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:15,840
well that's the thing uh in the

617
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:15,840
uh ace world you kind of assuming

618
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
foreign

619
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,879
so you need to indicate in some way

620
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,120
you can actually parse it and then from

621
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,840
there you

622
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,840
you know what you're using yeah

623
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,080
so i'm not sure if this is exactly the

624
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
question that kirsten was trying to

625
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,799
raise

626
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,960
but you know when you're in the scenario

627
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,360
where you have some things that are

628
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,279
already agreed to out of band and then

629
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,399
you're talking about do i need to add a

630
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,279
inbound mechanism to disambiguate

631
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,879
something else you have to ask yourself

632
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,080
is this something else that i'm trying

633
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,360
to disambiguate

634
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,678
something that could be agreed out of

635
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,678
band as well because i already have this

636
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,519
out-of-band mechanism

637
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,360
and my understanding is that the answer

638
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,120
is no that we do need an inband

639
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,240
mechanism here

640
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,199
because the sort of knowing what email

641
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,279
means that we say

642
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,799
is is out of band that's like a

643
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,240
universal constant

644
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,519
in some sense and the particular

645
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,200
encoding used by the different profiles

646
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,240
is something that can change and you

647
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,159
won't know a priori

648
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,840
so i think we do need some mechanism

649
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,480
here whether it's to

650
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,720
have a byte prefix or a c bar tag i

651
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,279
think both of those would work

652
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
yeah and daniel if you could go back one

653
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,960
slide

654
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,079
just to go on the slide on the

655
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,079
issue itself rather than the solution

656
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,119
um yeah that that's the

657
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,879
what you said then is that um this

658
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,520
happens when the client send the post

659
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,359
token

660
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,520
and uh the the

661
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,040
kdc or resource doesn't have other

662
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,280
information about

663
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:40,719
what application profile

664
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,720
the client is posting that token for

665
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,960
so

666
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,918
yeah but uh i don't know if

667
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,199
anybody else or so we talked about this

668
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,638
in a side meeting with christine and

669
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,279
marco i don't know if they want to add

670
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,960
anything if i

671
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,880
missed something or anybody else has

672
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:16,640
opinions or even

673
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:18,880
if you have opinions about i need to

674
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,040
think about this uh some more because

675
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,119
i'm not entirely sure what the various

676
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,880
uniqueness requirements here are

677
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,520
and what what the consequence of

678
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
not achieving uniqueness actually are

679
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,839
and what the attack vectors are

680
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,040
and so on so uh i think i have to take

681
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,759
this offline

682
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,160
but generally registering sibo takes is

683
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,240
is

684
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,440
something that you can easily do

685
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,319
registering one

686
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,880
byte c bar takes well there are only so

687
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,880
many

688
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,320
of them so i wouldn't be too optimistic

689
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,520
that we wouldn't we would go for one by

690
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,160
the plus one meant

691
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,320
it's probably one more byte than the

692
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,799
prefix which is at least one byte so

693
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,920
it's

694
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
two bytes um

695
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,240
and then you're in the queue as well

696
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:18,480
get myself out of the queue sorry okay

697
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,920
so yeah i guess we'll try to uh

698
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,200
to uh write down this problem

699
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,440
uh with cristiano marco and

700
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,118
and send it to the mailing list to see

701
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
if

702
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,560
we can get more discussion

703
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,800
i see um one one advantage of

704
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,839
um prefix is the the length

705
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,640
one bite yeah um but

706
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,599
is that something that um is really

707
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,520
important or

708
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,359
can we can can we leave with two bytes

709
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,440
or the the length here is not

710
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,759
uh okay matter because we're already

711
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,240
sending the token

712
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:08,320
so it's not good that's not going to

713
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:12,399
make it one bite in this case

714
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,960
it's more about what is uh simpler for

715
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,640
or what is more convenient for

716
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,440
implementers in some cases

717
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,240
as i said in some cases you don't even

718
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,720
need to have an indication of what

719
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,040
scope you're using because maybe you're

720
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,160
only using one application profile you

721
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,880
have already communicated with that with

722
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,879
the aes

723
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,440
so it might not be hinted but in some

724
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,799
other case

725
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,680
uh you might need it

726
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,680
and it might be one or the other

727
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,919
okay thank you i think so

728
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,359
um one coming from then um

729
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,480
on the driver and uh well that's easy to

730
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,078
say after

731
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,680
i had the same intuition that might be

732
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:12,720
using sibor might be cleaner

733
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,720
than a bite do you have any

734
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,440
um

735
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,439
it might be but then uh

736
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,000
yeah in some cases it might not be

737
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,520
necessary to

738
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,800
to use keyboard tags it's yeah

739
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,720
okay but i i will try to summarize this

740
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,560
um issue or the problem statement and

741
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,640
and get the discussion in the main

742
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,640
list or pick one

743
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,000
and then to the last slide

744
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:56,400
uh plan forward so i guess the first

745
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,760
point should be talk about more about

746
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,320
this scope encoding problem

747
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,599
and solution we have some other minor

748
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,760
clarification to do

749
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,599
we want to submit definitely submit a

750
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,079
new version before we can

751
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,720
think about moving forward to working

752
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,720
group let's go

753
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,720
okay sounds great any

754
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,720
comments on that from the working group

755
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,880
i'm seeing no one

756
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,160
so be ready to review that document soon

757
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,440
i mean um

758
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,879
version 11. uh when when do you think

759
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,119
you

760
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,560
you're are you planning to submit

761
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,800
version 11 before

762
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:46,160
the end of the year um depending on

763
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:51,119
how the conversation goes about uh

764
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,118
okay no yeah

765
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,560
okay

766
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,800
then i think it's marco

767
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,319
the next presentation thank you

768
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,599
francesca

769
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:14,079
yes hi everyone good morning or evening

770
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,680
so this is marco this is an update of an

771
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,920
application profile of ace

772
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,118
building on ac group con that francesca

773
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,280
presented

774
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,280
uh to enable authorized joining two

775
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,839
oscar groups

776
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,839
next slide please

777
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,240
right um just as a quick recap here

778
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,160
i know they're interested in joining

779
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,959
another group contacts and authorization

780
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,759
server to

781
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,200
get an access token as an evidence of

782
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,040
being authorized to be

783
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,240
a group member with a particular role or

784
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,160
a set of roles

785
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:48,078
the token is posted and what follows is

786
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,359
joining request joining response

787
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,880
exchange

788
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,640
and especially the the ace client here

789
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,000
gets in return the key material needed

790
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,118
later on in the group

791
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,880
to communicate with other group members

792
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,400
and the focus is really about that

793
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,640
getting authorization to get

794
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,599
into the group and get the group key

795
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,000
material

796
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,720
other things like communication in the

797
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,480
group or

798
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,160
accessing resources of group members or

799
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,160
autoscope of this document their cover

800
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,160
somewhere else

801
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,720
next slide please

802
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,640
okay uh some updates in this version too

803
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,680
uh aligning with keygroup com we have

804
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,400
also

805
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,720
had the renaming of the main resource

806
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,319
path

807
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,839
the group manager from group squared to

808
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,079
this group to keep it uh more general

809
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,400
anyway and following also uh

810
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,400
new content and requirements introduced

811
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,520
in hq com

812
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,640
we have also provided a summary of

813
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,839
the methods um intended to be

814
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,040
to be used by a node at every resource

815
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,160
or some resource and depending on that

816
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,200
exact

817
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,839
uh type of node so member or not member

818
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,560
yet

819
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,599
and depending on the exact roles it has

820
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,759
or can have

821
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,119
uh in the group so it's summarized also

822
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,319
in in this table

823
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,480
um extracted from the draft um

824
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,759
in the previous version already we we

825
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,319
introduced one more

826
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,160
um operation on the very root resource

827
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,759
ace group

828
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,160
where the payload is the current group

829
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,200
id of the group and what's return

830
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,279
is the invariant group name uh for that

831
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,480
group useful for other operations

832
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,079
and we realized in kirkum already that

833
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,760
that's something useful not only for

834
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,160
group members but in general

835
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,440
uh for other possible roles like the

836
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,480
verifier here

837
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,720
uh a if really missing possible

838
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,599
making operations and a change of group

839
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,040
id values

840
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:47,440
this is useful for verifiers too to

841
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,160
have an idea oh it's again about that

842
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,640
group

843
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,240
with that name and continue getting

844
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,920
public keys for verifying

845
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,078
uh signatures of flying messages

846
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,280
and just as a reminder here we are

847
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,880
considering

848
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:06,319
um scope as encoded uh building on

849
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,359
an aif data format with a find already

850
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,720
uh in the previous version

851
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,400
right there are also some updates in the

852
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,078
in the main parameter of the joining

853
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,720
response transporting the

854
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,680
the key material uh to a new uh joining

855
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,078
member

856
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,040
uh we used to have a client id parameter

857
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,520
borrowed by

858
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,880
the oscar security context object and

859
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,880
that parameter was

860
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,359
removed from that object definition in

861
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,880
the last update of your score profile

862
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,400
so we simply have to rename that

863
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,359
parameter as

864
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,480
group center id now also registered as a

865
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,720
new element

866
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,640
of that object but all in all keeping

867
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,359
the same meaning so the idea here is to

868
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,560
provide the

869
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,839
sender id assigned to this uh

870
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,920
journey node as a group member um

871
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,920
also since in the group score document

872
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,040
now we have the pairwise mode uh

873
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,440
just stable we have added here two

874
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,560
additional parameters uh again for the

875
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,640
joining response

876
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,839
uh in case the pairwise mode is

877
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,319
supported at all

878
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,400
in the group of course uh to describe

879
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:10,400
what algorithms and parameters are used

880
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,440
when the pairwise mode has to be used to

881
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,920
communicate in the group

882
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,520
and default values just like for other

883
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,839
parameters

884
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,800
are also defined in the corresponding

885
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,240
section

886
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,560
and the moment we have introduced these

887
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,319
parameters explicitly signaling

888
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,880
the pairwise mode and how it is supposed

889
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,920
to work uh we didn't need anymore

890
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,240
separate policy to tell uh that the

891
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,359
group

892
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,520
can rely on that mode as well so we

893
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,359
remove the the signaling of the separate

894
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,240
policy

895
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,240
next slide please

896
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,959
write some clarifications also on on the

897
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,640
requiem process

898
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,240
it can happen we say the rate that the

899
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,440
group member can request

900
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,000
uh for a new sender id uh from the group

901
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,880
manager

902
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,480
uh for a number of reasons uh in that

903
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,400
case it's up to the group manager to

904
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,280
decide what to do exactly

905
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,760
it can just provide a new sender id or

906
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,200
instead rekey the whole group

907
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,440
or do both uh so the this possible

908
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,200
set of alternatives uh have been

909
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,319
clarified

910
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,000
um also we we have uh

911
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:23,680
tried to align the bit better the group

912
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,640
manager described here with

913
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,359
uh requirements and and no reassignment

914
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,680
policies

915
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,240
already stated in the group score

916
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,520
document or the non-recycling of sender

917
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,118
ids and group ids

918
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,359
there's been a discussion also earlier

919
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,000
this week about this exact point

920
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:41,920
uh at the core meeting so something is

921
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,880
going to be updated in the group score

922
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,000
document

923
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,760
uh it will be reflected um here when it

924
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,960
comes to these details

925
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,920
and finally we

926
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,400
we had a resource type registration for

927
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,160
this

928
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,400
joining resource that can be contacted

929
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,279
by joining notes to access the group

930
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,319
that used to be registered in another uh

931
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,240
document

932
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,920
in in the co-working group and the

933
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,560
actual registration

934
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,160
uh was in fact moved here and well the

935
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,040
resource type can for instance be useful

936
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,078
for the sake of

937
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,000
uh discovering joining resources

938
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,480
uh just sending a request to well known

939
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,480
for instance

940
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,319
next slide please yeah

941
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,040
as a next step i expect at least one

942
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,000
more iteration to to align this document

943
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,960
with with the plan

944
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,720
changes in ace giga.com and with uh some

945
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,640
things i also mentioned before

946
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,598
in the in the group score document for

947
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,560
instance about uh no recycling policies

948
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:42,160
of ids uh we've been continuing working

949
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,078
on implementation and the whole

950
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,720
interface of the group manager is almost

951
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,920
complete i think only only three

952
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,560
operations are missing

953
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,960
uh we plan to have some tests i can take

954
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,160
how

955
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,079
peter van der stock and crystal

956
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,118
announces especially uh

957
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,800
in the near future uh so possibly after

958
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,760
that next version

959
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,720
this should be uh close to be considered

960
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,839
i hope

961
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,839
for a working robust call

962
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:15,839
ready or close uh

963
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,118
close to be conservative if you and the

964
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,119
group are all fine

965
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:25,839
well we can more seriously consider it

966
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,839
why not

967
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,599
any any comment

968
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,839
so i think you you have now um

969
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,200
another presentation on yeah the other

970
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,200
interface at the group

971
00:47:52,160 --> 00:48:00,160
just trying to open it in the same

972
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,280
yeah this one yeah thank you

973
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,399
uh so yeah this is another interface we

974
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,040
are describing

975
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,200
at the very same group manager uh this

976
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,640
document was adopted following the

977
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,960
previous itf meeting uh next slide

978
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,960
please

979
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,200
um all right while in the previous

980
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,919
presentation we focused on the

981
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,000
interface for uh joni nodes to access

982
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,680
the group and get the key material uh

983
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,280
this interface on the group manager is

984
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,240
instead intended for

985
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,880
an administrator user that can create

986
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,279
configure or delete

987
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,319
oscar groups before they can start being

988
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,200
operated

989
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,400
and overall it's following a high level

990
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,520
resource pattern

991
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,960
uh very similar um to the one intended

992
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,520
for the co-ops of broker

993
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,359
and right now we are supporting

994
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,240
operational message exchanges

995
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,119
uh both in link format and simple

996
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,000
payload or

997
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,680
or instead in coral with examples for

998
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,359
for both cases

999
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,000
so overall for the sake of this

1000
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,078
interface the group manager has

1001
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,520
one single instance of a group

1002
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,960
collection resource

1003
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,839
at the path say slash manage essentially

1004
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,480
including the

1005
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:17,359
the list of existing uh oscar groups

1006
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,760
and then for each uh existing oscar

1007
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:20,720
group

1008
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,079
uh one group configuration uh resource

1009
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,839
in fact mentioned uh

1010
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,000
in that list and each group

1011
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,960
configuration resource can be accessed

1012
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,559
as at slash manage slash well the name

1013
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,319
of the group and it includes the the

1014
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,359
current configuration

1015
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:37,200
um for the adult score group uh here we

1016
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:38,400
we have again the group manager this

1017
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,879
resource server and

1018
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,760
the administrator acting as client so it

1019
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,440
still has to

1020
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,440
get an access token and post it as per

1021
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,760
race to prove to be

1022
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,720
authorized to take these actions as a

1023
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,079
group manager for these groups

1024
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,520
next slide please yeah just

1025
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,119
some more details on the resource and

1026
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,960
the interface

1027
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,480
so on the left you can see the the

1028
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
possible operation on the

1029
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,079
root single group collection resource

1030
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,880
what we have today

1031
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,000
is a post uh a center the group

1032
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,800
collision resource to

1033
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,319
create a new group in fact and already

1034
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,920
at this point in time it's possible to

1035
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,680
provide

1036
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,040
a configuration for that group otherwise

1037
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,000
default values

1038
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:20,880
apply and when a group is created that

1039
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,520
practical mean

1040
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,319
two things for the sake of this actual

1041
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,880
document

1042
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,920
a child group configuration resource is

1043
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,920
created

1044
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,200
so including the configuration

1045
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,160
parameters

1046
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,279
for that group at the same time a

1047
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,839
totally different

1048
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,400
group membership resource is created and

1049
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,480
that's for

1050
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,839
joining the group according to the

1051
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,960
interface of

1052
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:47,520
the previously presented document uh

1053
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,040
issuing instead get request to this

1054
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,680
group collection resource it's possible

1055
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,800
to get the

1056
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,000
the full list of existing of core groups

1057
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,520
and well actually the

1058
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,440
links to the corresponding

1059
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,640
reconfiguration resources as child

1060
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,720
resources

1061
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,680
uh it's also possible to retrieve

1062
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,160
however uh

1063
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,520
just part of this list uh using fetch

1064
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,720
and specifying filter

1065
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,520
uh criteria for group configurations to

1066
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,040
match

1067
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,119
to have the group configuration

1068
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,640
resources returned

1069
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,359
in the list on the right instead just

1070
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,879
focusing on one instance here

1071
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,720
operations on the group configuration

1072
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,079
resources you can send

1073
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,480
a get to retrieve the

1074
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,480
the full configuration for that group so

1075
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,440
all the parameters and values

1076
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,280
describing it at the moment and now we

1077
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
have also introduced fetch in this

1078
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,920
update

1079
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,440
to retrieve only part of the

1080
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,000
configuration so only

1081
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,200
uh parameters expressed uh in the fetch

1082
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,040
request

1083
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,520
uh right now we can modern update

1084
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,558
i should say override all together the

1085
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,520
current configuration

1086
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,640
of the group brutally with a put we have

1087
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,880
plans to introduce

1088
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,480
patch also for a selective update and

1089
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,760
issuing a delete to this resource

1090
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,760
instead we just

1091
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,760
uh destroy the group so of course

1092
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,040
there's no safe operations have a side

1093
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,720
effect on the group and the group

1094
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,759
members that we are also

1095
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:13,200
describing in the document

1096
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,760
next slide please uh right

1097
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,200
in this particular update uh related to

1098
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,119
what i mentioned before also for the

1099
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,520
other document now that the pairwise mod

1100
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,640
of group

1101
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,880
score is stable uh we have already

1102
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,078
introduced configuration parameters here

1103
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,760
concerning

1104
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,000
uh the support for the pairwise mode in

1105
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
the group so essentially a flag

1106
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,160
telling the group manager if that mod is

1107
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,880
supported or not and well if it is

1108
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,920
uh more detailed parameters describing

1109
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,599
the algorithms

1110
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,280
and its parameters to be used for the

1111
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,640
sake of the pairwise mode

1112
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:47,599
and default values to possibly applied

1113
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,400
are not defined here they are defined in

1114
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,480
the previous

1115
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,920
application profile i are presented

1116
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,720
where we decided to

1117
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,400
collect all uh default values to to

1118
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,919
consider

1119
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,920
as i mentioned we have also introduced

1120
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,760
the the fetch method for the group

1121
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,000
configuration resources

1122
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
uh that we are supporting already both

1123
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,119
in the sieber

1124
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,240
and in the choral case so this is about

1125
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,000
retrieving just part of the

1126
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,160
configuration uh so only

1127
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,400
parameters indicated in the fetch

1128
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,598
payload and the values

1129
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,680
overall we have revised all the examples

1130
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,839
in the draft and include new ones

1131
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:26,839
especially for this fetch handler

1132
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,000
both in silver and coral next slide

1133
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,000
please

1134
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,920
right we have also clarified this point

1135
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,359
who take the final decision

1136
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,480
on the uh invariant once then

1137
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,598
once established group name so we still

1138
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,520
have the possibility for the

1139
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,480
administrator asking to create a group

1140
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,119
to specify

1141
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,760
an intended group name but then the

1142
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,680
final decision remains

1143
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,760
on the group manager that picks up a

1144
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,680
final group name also returned to the

1145
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,119
administrator in the response

1146
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,118
and it seems to be the best way and as

1147
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,559
also suggested by by christian i think

1148
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,119
uh at the discussion at the previous

1149
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,480
meeting

1150
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,319
uh this is good because the

1151
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,359
administrator can have

1152
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,960
uh more constraints than uh sorry the

1153
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,400
group manager can have more constraints

1154
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,960
than the administrator can

1155
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,240
even imagine about going for a feasible

1156
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,599
group name so it's good the group

1157
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,640
manager takes

1158
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,680
uh a final word on this

1159
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:23,359
um also we we actually have extended the

1160
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,598
registration procedure

1161
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:27,119
uh which practically means extending the

1162
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,599
uh the

1163
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,720
the creation of a new group uh request

1164
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,040
message

1165
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,399
uh so that the administrator indicates

1166
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,720
the group manager also

1167
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:42,960
uh the names of the application groups

1168
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:45,680
using this security and oscar group

1169
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,280
and this essentially aligns also

1170
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,160
operations

1171
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,200
following this draft for instance the

1172
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,640
registration

1173
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,480
of the security group um in in objects

1174
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,359
like resource directory so simplifying

1175
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,680
discovery

1176
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,799
of this security group and links for

1177
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,720
john 8

1178
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,880
to other nodes it was also something

1179
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:08,319
already suggesting in a discussion

1180
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,200
in core related to coral and choral

1181
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,200
forms

1182
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,598
but essentially makes the group manager

1183
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,078
aware of the application groups

1184
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,799
that are using or are going to use the

1185
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,960
security group

1186
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,559
next slide please that also clarifies

1187
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,079
this a bit more

1188
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,760
yeah following the creation of a

1189
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,359
security group here

1190
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,680
and now that the group manager has more

1191
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,440
information the group manager or the

1192
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,640
administrator can in fact proceed

1193
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,680
registering the link

1194
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,240
uh to join the security group uh to

1195
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,640
separate

1196
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,160
entities like for instance the uh the

1197
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:42,319
resource directory

1198
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,520
um and now it's much better that the

1199
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,000
group manager knows

1200
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,119
also the uh the names of the application

1201
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,160
groups um

1202
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,760
involved and they are in fact used as

1203
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,000
for instance target attributes in a

1204
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,280
particular approach we're describing for

1205
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,400
for doing this in another um core

1206
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,160
document

1207
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,400
we also give overall guidelines about

1208
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,520
this process and we we do recommend that

1209
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,000
the group manager really does that

1210
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:10,559
because it's it's the one most likely to

1211
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,960
to remain up-to-date on possible changes

1212
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,520
related to the oscar group or even

1213
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,240
its own address and uri they would

1214
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,720
require

1215
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,479
a refresh on what registered in the

1216
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,879
resources directory uh otherwise

1217
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,640
in principle uh the administrator would

1218
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:28,000
be also in a position to do

1219
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,000
uh those same registrations and speaking

1220
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,240
which we have also

1221
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,839
refined just the name of a previously

1222
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,359
registered resource type for the group

1223
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,520
collection resource

1224
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,359
and we've also added the registration of

1225
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,200
the resource type for the group

1226
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:45,040
configuration resource as well

1227
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:49,118
in the ayana registration section

1228
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,880
next and final slide i guess please okay

1229
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,880
yeah summarize new interface on the

1230
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,880
group manager for administrators to

1231
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,359
create configure and delete the oscar

1232
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,119
groups um

1233
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:00,799
we have quite a good set of operations

1234
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,640
already uh to be

1235
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,400
continued and finalized we have full

1236
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,200
support already for link format and

1237
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,319
sieber

1238
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,160
or coral operations and messages as

1239
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,440
immediateness steps we want to introduce

1240
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,319
the patch method

1241
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,680
to selectively update only part of the

1242
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:20,640
group configuration for an unscore group

1243
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,200
we like to uh to focus also on defining

1244
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:25,279
better

1245
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,598
format of scope again using

1246
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,760
aif and there was early discussion at

1247
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,040
the academ of the previous itf meeting

1248
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,760
in fact

1249
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,119
to to express scope in terms of patterns

1250
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,520
of group names

1251
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,880
that can be created and possibly

1252
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,160
configured

1253
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,960
this would open the way also to uh allow

1254
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,558
some actions not necessarily all of them

1255
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:49,359
also to

1256
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,000
other administrators coming in later on

1257
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,078
uh

1258
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,880
also different uh from the exact

1259
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,760
administrator that did create the group

1260
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,200
and also expanding on a previous

1261
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,520
discussion of choral forms that i

1262
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,000
mentioned also in the previous slide

1263
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,280
we can give some more guidelines when

1264
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,960
coral is used

1265
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,799
in the response to the administrator

1266
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,599
following the registration especially in

1267
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,480
case something

1268
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,319
went wrong to guide the administrator on

1269
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,880
what's the correct way to proceed for

1270
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,119
correct

1271
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:20,640
group creation in times for instance of

1272
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,640
message format and api

1273
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,399
and that should be all from my side

1274
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,400
thank you

1275
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,839
a lot of backup slides yeah you can skip

1276
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,359
them totally

1277
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:39,680
just in case okay

1278
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,680
thank you um any questions

1279
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,520
christian um i've seen

1280
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,040
in in this document but also in many

1281
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,160
other ace documents so this might be

1282
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,160
more general

1283
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:54,799
um a lot of um resources that are given

1284
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,879
with in the document with uh basically

1285
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:59,839
with a path that starts with slash

1286
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,480
so um how is very generally best

1287
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,839
practice

1288
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,960
uh 190 about uri namespace ownership and

1289
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:08,558
path ownership

1290
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,559
um treat it here how is this managed

1291
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,599
entry point supposed to be discovered

1292
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,880
is this a fixed path that might be

1293
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,680
considered for being a well-known path

1294
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,400
um so this this applies here with slash

1295
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,319
manage but

1296
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:26,400
probably also applies to the the group

1297
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,400
probably everything else we've seen

1298
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,400
today

1299
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,960
uh as far as i know we've been following

1300
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,079
the the wording already from the ace

1301
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,520
framework about

1302
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,400
um this is a default example or not even

1303
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,319
default actually

1304
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,839
just an example your implementation can

1305
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,680
go for something else

1306
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,160
and we've been trying to use resource

1307
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,919
types to help discovery and

1308
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,759
well the framework two versions ago i

1309
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,280
think introduced also

1310
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,359
um a resource type for uh

1311
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,359
one of its resources to support

1312
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:00,319
discovery

1313
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,520
i think this should be the current

1314
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,640
status at least

1315
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,640
if i'm not missing anything

1316
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,480
does that answer to your question

1317
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,319
i'll look through the document with with

1318
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,359
the focus on this but

1319
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:29,359
if if slash if this is a

1320
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:31,598
discovered entry point it's

1321
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,119
it's probably okay so i think there's a

1322
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,160
there's a rough preference

1323
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,119
for things that don't

1324
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,558
give that static structure at all but if

1325
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,119
this

1326
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,839
but kind of if if the structure is given

1327
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,200
under the

1328
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,319
an entry point it's probably okay as

1329
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,839
long as the entry point is discovered

1330
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:55,520
personally if the creation just

1331
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,520
returned the location and that location

1332
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,280
is then the location of that thing

1333
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,799
whether it's in a sub-path or somewhere

1334
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,960
else but

1335
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,680
that might be a matter of taste the root

1336
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,079
resource is not

1337
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:09,118
to jump in this has been kirakos sadie

1338
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,359
again

1339
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,960
i think the intent is that in the

1340
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:15,359
document we refer to

1341
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,400
like a name of the endpoint a

1342
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:19,119
descriptive name

1343
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,319
and maybe the slides were not as careful

1344
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,079
about

1345
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,880
using the descriptive name instead of

1346
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,119
slash name

1347
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,040
but i think the documents tend to be

1348
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,359
more careful about that and yes we do

1349
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,558
try to

1350
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:37,119
reflect bcp 190 and i guess the

1351
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,680
revisions underway to bcp 190 make it

1352
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,880
easier

1353
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,640
to say that if the the parent is

1354
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,480
discovered then you can have

1355
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,480
fixed strings as the subpaths

1356
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,240
and we should probably not dwell on that

1357
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,839
too much right now because i think we

1358
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:56,959
do need to watch the clock

1359
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,960
but thank you for bringing it up

1360
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:08,480
okay any additional question

1361
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,480
comments

1362
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:16,240
no um

1363
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:21,839
checking the driver no so i guess now

1364
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,839
we move to the chateau discussion

1365
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,079
and then we will

1366
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,640
present with the remaining time the new

1367
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,640
topics

1368
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:41,200
yes the clock uh we have

1369
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:43,440
just under an hour left so yeah

1370
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,879
we can of course discuss the charter as

1371
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,520
being a little bit more important

1372
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,119
because

1373
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,960
uh depending on how the charter goes we

1374
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,880
may or may not be able to do

1375
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:56,720
the new topics yeah

1376
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:00,000
so um let's kick up the discussion

1377
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:02,720
as anyone i mean um

1378
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,520
do you can you read the charter now if

1379
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:07,919
you haven't

1380
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:11,680
read it and see how

1381
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,680
you agree with the suggestions

1382
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,280
so let's read the first paragraph

1383
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:31,839
i'm highly highlighting it

1384
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:45,839
i'm gonna send the link

1385
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:45,839
to the jobber

1386
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,038
so michael please

1387
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,880
hi um i was distracted by the buff as

1388
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:41,599
well

1389
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,799
but i'm reading this um i read it before

1390
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,079
um

1391
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,000
so the last part about est tl esp

1392
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,839
est co-app well so that's done it's in

1393
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,520
the rfc editor's queue you could

1394
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:54,240
i think at this point strike it from the

1395
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:57,520
charter um except for the question about

1396
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,680
someone would like to do cmp now um

1397
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:01,680
and i always thought it was weird to do

1398
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:05,200
this in this group in the first place

1399
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,960
um so um

1400
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,520
i don't know what to suggest there but i

1401
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,920
think as it's currently written

1402
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:15,280
restricted to est and we're done that

1403
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:15,280
work you might as well strike it

1404
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:20,079
okay so yeah i mean you're talking about

1405
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,359
this spot are you

1406
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:25,839
yeah i am yeah okay if

1407
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:28,000
if if it's restricted to est and so it

1408
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,799
really doesn't fit for cmp

1409
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,760
then strike it if you want to do other

1410
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,359
things then

1411
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,559
other wording will be necessary but at

1412
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,880
this point it's done you might as well

1413
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:39,440
strike it that's what i'm trying to say

1414
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,359
okay i i think the the important word

1415
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:50,079
was a profile

1416
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:52,799
in here but i see your own

1417
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,200
all i'm saying is that at as written

1418
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,160
it's

1419
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:56,558
very narrow and that works already done

1420
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,279
so

1421
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,400
either strike the word that sentence out

1422
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,119
because we're done

1423
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:08,240
or expanded in some way there okay

1424
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,200
okay so the previous paragraph i see

1425
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,038
says cmp

1426
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,359
and that could say it or not include it

1427
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,359
or not

1428
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:21,119
yes can you hear me oh

1429
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:24,319
okay this is euron um so

1430
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:27,760
so this yes what is done is est

1431
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:33,038
over co-op s but what is not done

1432
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:35,039
is est protected by oscor and ad hoc

1433
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,760
so that's i think the reason why this

1434
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:41,039
paragraph still could stay

1435
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:44,319
in the draft in the charter

1436
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:47,839
so um my question is um

1437
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:51,200
maybe to i mean to michael and um

1438
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:54,720
and gurren uh profile is profile

1439
01:06:51,200 --> 01:07:01,839
not specific enough and you would prefer

1440
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:01,839
um clearly mentioning um oscar

1441
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,720
and that's so that's what i would

1442
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,839
suggest why don't you just start and end

1443
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,480
the sentence there

1444
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:16,480
and not be cmp or esp or

1445
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,558
um

1446
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:31,520
so this is your own um i i

1447
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:33,520
i disagree with the change here i i

1448
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:36,720
propose this paragraph

1449
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,200
uh because we're done with one part of

1450
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:42,558
the est profiling but we are not part

1451
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,118
done with the other part so remind you

1452
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,880
about the

1453
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,000
ace interim if this was discussed on the

1454
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,520
mailing list there was an ace interim

1455
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:56,559
in three years ago where we discussed

1456
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:58,720
different profiles of the est protocol

1457
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,319
and one is done but the other is not so

1458
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,439
that's why i proposed

1459
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:06,000
a charter text which included both

1460
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,280
to illustrate that we have we are

1461
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,359
working on this

1462
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,880
and we have more work to do so i don't

1463
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:13,279
really know why we should

1464
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,000
take this out this is we are halfway

1465
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,359
through the

1466
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:20,479
through the world what i'm trying to say

1467
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:21,520
is that i think that if we want to

1468
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,000
include

1469
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,359
enrollment protocols over co-op then

1470
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,158
let's just say that

1471
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,520
and link the details as to which ones uh

1472
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,559
elsewhere maybe the

1473
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,239
isg won't like that but that just seems

1474
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,080
simpler to me

1475
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:37,519
oh i'm sorry i'm sorry michael now i see

1476
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,519
what you say i'm

1477
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,040
i was a bit a little bit locked in my

1478
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,159
own thoughts here so yes you're saying

1479
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:45,439
that

1480
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,719
with a change made now we include all

1481
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,358
aspects of

1482
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,399
enrollment over koa sorry if someone

1483
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,600
wants to know which

1484
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:58,559
we could put such as but not limited to

1485
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:02,880
right yeah this is fine

1486
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,880
go ahead then

1487
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,158
uh no i was preparing to say something

1488
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:12,799
that i don't need to say anymore

1489
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:12,799
okay so andrick

1490
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:22,640
yes so i'm i'm fine with that

1491
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:25,120
as i read it that it is the cmp of a

1492
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:28,239
co-op work is included

1493
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,759
as posted in the jabra so for cmp

1494
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,358
transport over co-op

1495
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:36,640
no profiling of cmp is needed so it's

1496
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,880
just addressing the the transport

1497
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,759
of the messages so this is different to

1498
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,279
to est

1499
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:47,198
so yeah i would be fine

1500
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:50,799
okay so i am hearing that

1501
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,799
everyone agrees with the text

1502
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:56,400
um now the thing is that i i would like

1503
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,920
to

1504
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,960
but um i mean this is uh my personal

1505
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,080
opinion

1506
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,800
um i would like to i mean um the current

1507
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,920
charter

1508
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:13,920
does not mention cmp and east profile

1509
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,320
so i am wondering i would like to avoid

1510
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,640
to

1511
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:21,840
have that discussion again and again

1512
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:25,199
so i'm wondering

1513
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:29,840
if we can agree

1514
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:33,519
um on whether a

1515
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:45,520
is part of that work as well as

1516
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:48,880
est profiles

1517
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:51,199
so garen is so i'm reading the chat

1518
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,199
um

1519
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:59,839
screenshot cue oh okay

1520
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:15,120
so i guess we're not uh not seeing too

1521
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:19,440
many more

1522
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:21,760
other comments queued up so

1523
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,199
sounds like we should declare victory

1524
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,640
and uh go ahead and

1525
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:30,159
confirm this on the list yeah so

1526
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,280
but um my question was um

1527
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:37,519
um i mean we had some discussions

1528
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:40,880
um between the east profiles

1529
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:44,960
and cm i mean a bit mostly cmpv2

1530
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:47,360
and is profile and

1531
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,120
i mean none of those appear in the

1532
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:52,400
charter

1533
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,440
uh so what i just

1534
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:59,120
i'm wondering if if if it would not be

1535
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:02,159
the time to clarify that the

1536
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,559
both of these items are part of the

1537
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:04,559
charter

1538
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,920
uh so i think that michael's phrasing

1539
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:12,719
about

1540
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,400
uh including but not necessarily limited

1541
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,800
to

1542
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,159
might be a useful way to get those in

1543
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,960
because that would indicate

1544
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,599
that's what we have in mind now but if

1545
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,600
there is

1546
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,800
potentially some other thing that comes

1547
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,840
up

1548
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,159
uh that we feel uh need to work on

1549
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,199
this would be an okay place to do such

1550
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:33,519
work

1551
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,519
provided there's justification for

1552
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,840
actually doing it

1553
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,520
we don't want to develop uh certificate

1554
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:42,159
enrollment protocols just for the fun of

1555
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,159
it after all

1556
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:47,679
yeah yeah my purpose was just to avoid

1557
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:51,839
um

1558
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:51,840
another discussion um

1559
01:12:52,080 --> 01:13:00,640
okay so is the current text

1560
01:12:55,199 --> 01:13:00,639
um proposed by enrique fine too

1561
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,840
current michael benn

1562
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,239
yeah i think that's fine okay i might

1563
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,280
worry

1564
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:24,879
but i don't need to do that right now

1565
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:26,800
okay so my understanding is that the

1566
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,960
current text with all the

1567
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:34,239
the um i mean is that

1568
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,239
everyone is fine with that

1569
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:41,600
anyone having um any comment

1570
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,440
it's the time to say it

1571
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,600
we will confirm that to the mailing list

1572
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:48,239
anyway

1573
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,239
but um

1574
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,640
i'm hearing everyone is fine so

1575
01:13:51,679 --> 01:14:01,840
thank you very much and we can move to

1576
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:01,840
the next items

1577
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,480
so i think it's

1578
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,320
marco that's correct

1579
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,120
hi again so the group boy score

1580
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,679
profiling

1581
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,679
i mean uh

1582
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:26,080
in group o s profile

1583
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,080
there's too many till tiloka

1584
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:43,839
okay copy link

1585
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,920
great thank you thanks

1586
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:54,879
uh this is a new proposed transport

1587
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,560
uh profile base uh to use grupo score as

1588
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,800
security protocol to

1589
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:04,480
access resources of group members

1590
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:07,280
of an oscar group in an authorized way

1591
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,280
next slide please

1592
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,719
um so why are we doing this uh

1593
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,560
there are use cases where you want to

1594
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,800
have a good communication

1595
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,000
uh and you want to secure it for

1596
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,080
instance with a

1597
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,040
group of score and on the communication

1598
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,600
side we are fine and we have solution to

1599
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,480
enforce

1600
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,840
access control to access the group and

1601
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,599
get the key material

1602
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,199
to use group score in the group that's

1603
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:36,640
essentially what we saw

1604
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:39,919
uh in the previous presentation today uh

1605
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,360
we argued as a separate uh domain to

1606
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:44,560
cover in terms of us

1607
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,280
of access control though uh

1608
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,080
if you if you use simply the document we

1609
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,800
saw before

1610
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:52,559
and you are authorized to get into the

1611
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,679
group you do that and you get the key

1612
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,000
material

1613
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,120
for very simple use cases this is just

1614
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,520
fine

1615
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,280
and you don't need to do anything more

1616
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,920
in particular for the sake of access

1617
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,199
control

1618
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,239
uh once in the group essentially you can

1619
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,400
think that

1620
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,360
being in the group and and having the

1621
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,719
keys and

1622
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,480
essentially having access to the

1623
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,679
messages uh

1624
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:17,440
gives also you access to any resource

1625
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:20,239
at any member of the group with any

1626
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:23,280
method and again this can be fine

1627
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,759
in some application we just argue that

1628
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,400
um

1629
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,199
it's not fine in general where you may

1630
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:30,159
want to have

1631
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:31,678
different clients authorized to do

1632
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:34,480
different things

1633
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,920
at different group members to con to be

1634
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,919
considered as

1635
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,920
resource servers essentially you have

1636
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,280
different classes of access rights

1637
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:44,800
uh for different clients and sure one

1638
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,360
can try to address this

1639
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,400
just creating several security group

1640
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,000
groups

1641
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:54,000
one for each class

1642
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,480
of access rights but they would

1643
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
complicate management of groups and key

1644
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,360
material

1645
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
considerably especially in case

1646
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:06,000
classes of access rights change over

1647
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,840
time requiring change of group and

1648
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,280
possibly rekeying

1649
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,960
so we started to think about something

1650
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:17,040
different

1651
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:19,199
next slide please

1652
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,199
so just to give examples the first one

1653
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:24,080
is really a toy example

1654
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,759
a simple home automation application for

1655
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,960
example when you may want to have some

1656
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,840
clients like

1657
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,679
kids only able to check the status of a

1658
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,320
lock while parents are instead fined to

1659
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:34,719
both

1660
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,519
check and change the status of the lock

1661
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,000
or or

1662
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,880
even a more simple detail you may want

1663
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,040
locks to

1664
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:42,480
to act only resource servers and not to

1665
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,840
start opening

1666
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:48,879
and closing each other

1667
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:52,080
so clearly not everyone can do anything

1668
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,000
at anyone else a more real-life use case

1669
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:57,120
was also suggested by

1670
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,239
dave robin from bacnet where they

1671
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,120
consider

1672
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:02,239
in fact different classes of clients in

1673
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,120
terms of

1674
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,959
um intended privileges so you may have

1675
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:08,559
some clients intended only for low

1676
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,280
privilege operations

1677
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,880
another class of clients for doing both

1678
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,400
low and high

1679
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:19,120
uh privilege level of operation and

1680
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,759
uh some clients only are supposed to

1681
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,719
change the

1682
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,320
minimum required level of operation at a

1683
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,520
given time

1684
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,320
so clearly here as well not everyone can

1685
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:33,040
do

1686
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:35,920
anything at anyone else in the group

1687
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,920
next slide please

1688
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:44,080
uh right so as i mentioned before we see

1689
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,280
two different domains of access control

1690
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:47,360
here one is about

1691
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,519
being authorized to get into the group

1692
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,559
and get the keys which practically means

1693
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,280
having access to

1694
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,159
to the messages that's fine and that's

1695
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,199
covered

1696
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:59,839
with other works we also saw uh today uh

1697
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,559
the second domain that uh we argue

1698
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,040
should be

1699
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:04,080
addressed separately instead um in

1700
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,880
general is about

1701
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:08,880
uh ones in the group uh having

1702
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,600
authorized access with fine grain access

1703
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,360
control

1704
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,520
at the recesses of other group members

1705
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,559
and of course one can think of using

1706
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,040
uh ace and the access tokens for that

1707
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:20,800
so you need a profile uh well the

1708
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,400
current profiles around

1709
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:25,520
don't cover access control with secure

1710
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:28,000
group communication

1711
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,880
in in the domain i i'm really addressing

1712
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,679
here

1713
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,760
the closest thing we can have is the

1714
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,159
score profile but of course it considers

1715
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:38,159
the oscore protocol uh

1716
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:39,199
not group of scores so it doesn't really

1717
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,199
target a

1718
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:42,400
group communication so it seems we are

1719
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:45,199
missing uh

1720
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,239
a transport profile with fine grain

1721
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:48,839
access control

1722
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:50,000
and supporting secure communication

1723
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,360
practically

1724
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,360
with the group score protocol

1725
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:56,480
next slide please

1726
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,480
and that's essentially the proposal of

1727
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:04,000
this document so

1728
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:07,839
it describes a new transport profile

1729
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,679
using grouposcore um a security protocol

1730
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,080
between the client and resource servers

1731
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:15,040
as um already members

1732
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:15,920
of the group and i'll come back to this

1733
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,320
point but we have

1734
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,360
uh try to clarify in as best as possible

1735
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,320
the timeline

1736
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,639
uh here in the document so the client

1737
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:27,040
and resource servers consider here

1738
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,080
are already group members the joining

1739
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,920
happened first

1740
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:32,000
for both of them according to the

1741
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:35,120
approach of the document presented

1742
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,320
earlier today after that all this can

1743
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,239
happen

1744
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,599
to enforce access control in accessing

1745
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,638
resources of group members

1746
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,639
and here we practically have the access

1747
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,639
token he issued in this profile

1748
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,520
bound to the group of score security

1749
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:51,760
context and we achieve the typical

1750
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,960
properties you uh you can also achieve

1751
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,600
in other profiles

1752
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,040
so there's proof of possession of the

1753
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,520
client signature key

1754
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:00,560
meaning the senior key used in the oscar

1755
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,920
group

1756
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,600
that's achieved by the resource server

1757
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,639
when receiving a first request from the

1758
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,600
client and

1759
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,480
it works both for the group mode uh or

1760
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,360
pairwise mode

1761
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:12,400
or group of score already the resource

1762
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,639
server can

1763
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,480
can achieve proof of group membership so

1764
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,440
to say so it can actually check that the

1765
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,120
client is

1766
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:22,960
indeed a member of that oscar group

1767
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,040
and there's also mutual authentication

1768
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:26,639
that is of course achieved only when a

1769
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,800
full exchange

1770
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,080
is completed liking the escort profile

1771
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:34,000
by the way

1772
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:38,159
next slide please um

1773
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,560
so this up check uh please

1774
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:43,839
just do the updates or do you also plan

1775
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,840
to do the protocol overview

1776
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:53,199
updates mostly i would say okay cool

1777
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:54,960
thanks please continue yeah uh

1778
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:56,719
yeah a number of dates updates have been

1779
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,320
included in this latest version

1780
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,320
uh as i mentioned we clarified the

1781
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,199
timeline that was mostly requested by

1782
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,840
ben actually

1783
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:05,759
in the singapore meeting last year so

1784
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,239
this is really about something for nodes

1785
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,440
that are

1786
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:12,559
already group members the join have to

1787
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,960
have to has to happen first uh then we

1788
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,080
have

1789
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:18,239
considerably simplified the the profile

1790
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,320
and the workflow of the protocol itself

1791
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:22,239
uh thanks to input from joran so now the

1792
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,679
document really focuses

1793
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:27,440
on the grupo score uh protocol only

1794
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:28,800
uh for secure communication between

1795
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,519
clients and servers

1796
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,440
and uh the the public key that the

1797
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,840
client uses in the group is in fact used

1798
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,080
as

1799
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:38,080
a proof of possession key and that

1800
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:41,040
simplifies the workflow overall

1801
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,239
and also the message format and their

1802
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:47,199
processing

1803
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:50,638
um still we added an appendix

1804
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:52,719
including what used to be the original

1805
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:55,760
version of this profile

1806
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,840
and considering both oscor and group

1807
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,960
score and security protocol so in

1808
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,719
addition to that

1809
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,400
you would also have the possibility to

1810
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:05,360
establish um

1811
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:07,679
a pairwise or security context between a

1812
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:09,679
client and the resource server

1813
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:11,840
as i said it's an appendix for now if

1814
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:12,960
not worthwhile or relevant enough can be

1815
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,320
easily removed

1816
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:18,159
but that appendix now is also aligned

1817
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,440
with details of the latest version of

1818
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,839
the oscar profile

1819
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,440
by the way just just for the sake of

1820
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,600
alignment

1821
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:28,320
next slide please yeah if time does not

1822
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,800
allow i

1823
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:32,080
i can skip the protocol overview but it

1824
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,199
just follows the

1825
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,920
the basic ace workflow and yeah some

1826
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:38,799
more

1827
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,080
information has to be provided into the

1828
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:43,520
token request and

1829
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:45,360
that's also echoed in the token

1830
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,679
but again we can skip this details if

1831
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,679
you want

1832
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,840
yeah i think it's probably most

1833
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:54,880
expedient to skip the details

1834
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:57,120
today we do have a few other

1835
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,639
presentations we want to hear from but

1836
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:59,360
this is the core of the proposal

1837
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,760
essentially

1838
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:03,839
so so checking this at a high level a

1839
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,600
client is interested to to access with

1840
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,679
fine grain access control

1841
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,600
resources at two group members rs1 there

1842
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:12,080
is two here it gets a token

1843
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,679
for rs1 just some of the new

1844
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,920
informations i did here

1845
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,960
are also in the slide so first token is

1846
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:20,080
received

1847
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:23,679
and posted and confirmed next slide

1848
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:24,239
please yeah the same happens to get a

1849
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,520
token

1850
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:31,519
for rstu also posted to rsdu

1851
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,520
next slide please

1852
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,800
yeah and following that the client can

1853
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,360
send a request in group

1854
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,159
score in this example over multicast and

1855
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,920
in group mode

1856
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:42,000
received by the two resource servers

1857
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,400
they each reply with one response in

1858
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,960
group

1859
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:46,400
score that can be either groupon or

1860
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:49,120
payouts mode and

1861
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,638
i said before for uh either mode proof

1862
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:52,239
of possession is achieved

1863
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,159
at the resource server either by

1864
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:54,799
directly verifying a counter signature

1865
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:56,960
or

1866
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,239
decrypting uh the message in the first

1867
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,000
place using

1868
01:24:58,239 --> 01:25:02,879
a pairwise key derived out of the

1869
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:06,239
asymmetric keys of the two nodes

1870
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:08,000
next slide please yeah it's a new

1871
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:10,320
transfer profile base

1872
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
to bring fingering access control as per

1873
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,799
ace

1874
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,040
security protocol and we still have an

1875
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,440
appendix describing an old version with

1876
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,280
both

1877
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,559
all scoring group score and security

1878
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,559
protocol uh

1879
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,719
so these changes incorporated mostly

1880
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,360
comments from from ben and joran

1881
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:28,480
and as next step we would like to give

1882
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,799
guidelines on

1883
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,080
how even the main mode with the group of

1884
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:34,960
score only

1885
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,360
uh the client can possibly go separately

1886
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,000
for

1887
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,639
uh an execution of the oscar profile as

1888
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,560
is

1889
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,040
in case it has also second thought later

1890
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:45,760
on and once also pairwise context

1891
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:46,639
with that resource server and of course

1892
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:55,840
with welcome

1893
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:55,840
comments and document reviews

1894
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,560
any comment

1895
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:10,480
so uh because we are

1896
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:11,360
somehow running out of time i propose

1897
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:14,000
that

1898
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,159
we move to the next presentation which

1899
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,159
is

1900
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,840
goran

1901
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:31,679
we know it's in scope um

1902
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:34,480
can you hear me yeah i mean

1903
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,760
it's me i got some error message here so

1904
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,000
i got a bit nervous

1905
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,040
so good morning everyone and your salon

1906
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,800
there

1907
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:45,840
i'm yeah so the

1908
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:48,480
the title slide showed the co-authors of

1909
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:52,639
this proposal

1910
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:53,280
this is a as i mentioned in the charter

1911
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,760
discussion

1912
01:26:53,280 --> 01:27:02,639
a way to do certificate enrollment

1913
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:05,840
protected with uh ad hoc and oscore

1914
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:06,960
and it builds on on other drafts now we

1915
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,080
already mentioned today

1916
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,440
cms and cmc which jim shard worked on

1917
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:13,360
and we have the enrollment of secure

1918
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:17,519
transport and then

1919
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:18,559
the draft which is soon for publication

1920
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,000
the esd co-op

1921
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:24,639
s uh draft protecting

1922
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,120
esd payloads over dtls and co-op and

1923
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:28,480
this

1924
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:30,880
draft is closely following that draft

1925
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,519
but uh replacing dtls with that hopkins

1926
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,239
low score

1927
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,239
next like this

1928
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:41,199
uh yeah this this is saying more or less

1929
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,199
the same thing

1930
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:47,120
we have the est request response

1931
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:50,719
messages which are the same

1932
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:53,760
and we replace the security uh

1933
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:57,360
or complement security with

1934
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:58,960
security on co-op or http layer

1935
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,839
and then running over various transports

1936
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,840
next slide please

1937
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:11,040
it's uh section by section copying

1938
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:14,080
stuff from from ust or referencing

1939
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:15,519
the corpus profile of sd

1940
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,120
yeah you see here discovery the

1941
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,960
functions the payload formats measured

1942
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:21,280
findings

1943
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:22,320
response codes and the delayed responses

1944
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:25,040
which is defined

1945
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:27,199
in that draft introduced in that graph

1946
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,840
and then fragmentation

1947
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:29,839
next slide

1948
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:39,040
and it also adds some some features

1949
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:41,599
so we have a new resource type attribute

1950
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:44,239
in the discovery to

1951
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:46,239
to show that this this profile is

1952
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:49,280
supported

1953
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:53,360
we have started to define

1954
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:56,880
a one new est operation

1955
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,719
to request raw public key space transfer

1956
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:01,840
anchors

1957
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,400
and we have an appendix defining seaborn

1958
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:05,199
coding

1959
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:06,239
obviously payload so you could actually

1960
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:07,759
use

1961
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,839
you could have a certificate signing

1962
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:12,159
request in

1963
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,120
and you could also have a certificate in

1964
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:16,000
cbor

1965
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:17,440
as defined in another draft so that

1966
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,040
means that you don't need to use any

1967
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:22,839
asn1

1968
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:25,920
encoding at all in in in the constrained

1969
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,840
device and there are

1970
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,080
some other optimizations following from

1971
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,719
using

1972
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,320
an ad hoc as it has some lightweight

1973
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:39,840
features

1974
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,840
the next slide

1975
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:43,839
and another feature with with uh with

1976
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,560
all score

1977
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:46,560
is that

1978
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,250
we don't need to make any assumptions on

1979
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,519
the

1980
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:54,719
[Music]

1981
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:57,520
co-op http proxy so

1982
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,679
the real realistic scenario will have a

1983
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:02,800
a constrained

1984
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:06,000
esd client perhaps only supporting

1985
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:09,440
co-op and a esd server

1986
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,120
perhaps only supporting http so you need

1987
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:14,799
to proxy the

1988
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:16,480
enrollment request and

1989
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,480
with the use of oscore you don't need to

1990
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:21,678
do anything

1991
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,280
est related in the proxy so you could

1992
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:26,080
actually just

1993
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,040
just pass it on and then you could get

1994
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,239
end-to-end security

1995
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:33,600
and that's the next slide last slide is

1996
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:35,360
um next steps we need to complete the

1997
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,840
additions on on the

1998
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,679
the new est function submit a new

1999
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,719
version

2000
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:46,719
um we think it's fairly

2001
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:50,000
um similar to to the esd

2002
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,400
co-op s but we'd like to have reviews of

2003
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,880
course

2004
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:53,519
see what people think about about the

2005
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,040
additions

2006
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:57,040
and how this fits into the

2007
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:02,400
the settings use cases you are working

2008
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,760
on

2009
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,759
so any comments questions

2010
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:17,840
any comment questions

2011
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:25,840
i'm hearing known so oh

2012
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:27,760
ben uh just

2013
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,360
this is a great chance to see if we can

2014
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:32,639
get anyone on the record as saying that

2015
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,920
they will review the document

2016
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,080
if they don't have any comments right

2017
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:36,080
now

2018
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:41,760
so your question is who has reviewed the

2019
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:44,799
document

2020
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,000
or who plans to review the document all

2021
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:58,400
right that's even better

2022
01:31:46,000 --> 01:32:00,719
yeah any volunteers

2023
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:01,839
uh michael says i'm in i think i'm

2024
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,440
involved already

2025
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,880
he's not formally on warsaw but but yes

2026
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:09,678
yes michael has been in the discussion

2027
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,679
for a while as well

2028
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,000
so but if you have any other comments

2029
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,360
unless you have

2030
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:27,440
already provided your comments that

2031
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:30,400
would be very very helpful michael

2032
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:32,320
then maybe we can also ask the question

2033
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:36,719
so i think we are over

2034
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:40,719
with this presentation and we um

2035
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:40,719
so francesca said she will review

2036
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:44,800
ben do you want to ask that question

2037
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,080
also for

2038
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,080
the previous presentation

2039
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:57,519
let's uh just see if people can type

2040
01:32:54,960 --> 01:33:01,199
that in jabber i don't think we should

2041
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:08,560
try and get the the live audio

2042
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:13,599
for that part

2043
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:23,840
okay so let's move to

2044
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:23,840
the second presentation from garen

2045
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:38,960
okay thank you so here is uh another

2046
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,080
draft

2047
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:44,159
making use of of ad hoc and the

2048
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:47,600
lightweight properties of ad hoc

2049
01:33:44,159 --> 01:33:51,360
in this case this

2050
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:55,280
is a way to combine authorization

2051
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:58,559
and authentication in a lightweight

2052
01:33:55,280 --> 01:34:02,080
manner so these are my co-authors and

2053
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,080
uh please take the next slide

2054
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,840
so i i can easily spend more than 10

2055
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,239
minutes here but i suppose i won't

2056
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,080
since uh ben ben has asked this to be a

2057
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,480
little bit more restrictive on time

2058
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:15,120
uh this there's a lot of uh arrows and

2059
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,480
colors

2060
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:21,599
in in at least in the first slides uh

2061
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,080
so i'll try to

2062
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,199
just to let you know um we have one more

2063
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:28,400
presentation

2064
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:31,440
um which is for the revoked token

2065
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,480
notification which is 10-15 minutes so

2066
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:35,360
you have uh

2067
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,638
roughly 10-15 minutes okay i'll i'll try

2068
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:40,639
to make it into

2069
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:45,440
or i will make into 10. um so this

2070
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:47,840
the setting here is the device

2071
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:50,000
joined the on say the onboarding of a

2072
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,600
device in a network

2073
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,280
uh which has been described in different

2074
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:56,639
contexts

2075
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:58,000
uh enrollment over secure transport has

2076
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:00,560
as one description

2077
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
we have the and there are many other

2078
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:04,719
settings

2079
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,440
and in you have typically a number of

2080
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,119
faces

2081
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,040
in this procedure there is an

2082
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:12,159
authentication phase

2083
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:14,960
there is an authorization phase which

2084
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:16,879
can happen in parallel but sometimes in

2085
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:20,719
sequence

2086
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:24,159
and uh it might involve a trusted party

2087
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,040
like the authorization server and then

2088
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:28,320
there might be

2089
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:32,239
as an est and enrollment phase

2090
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:35,280
where you enroll in local certificate

2091
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:38,320
with the network you're joining

2092
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:42,880
and the problem statement is about this

2093
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:46,719
doing things in sequence which inc

2094
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:49,199
adds latency and you said past the same

2095
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:52,000
data in different phases

2096
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:54,799
and also that you don't always make use

2097
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,760
of the fact that you have may have an

2098
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,280
the internet behind that behind the

2099
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:03,040
authenticator in this case

2100
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:05,199
uh so you don't need to pass so much

2101
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:07,679
data really all the constraints next

2102
01:36:05,199 --> 01:36:07,678
slide first

2103
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,679
so we have the blue the red and the

2104
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,440
black

2105
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:19,119
face here and in the next slide

2106
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:20,320
uh we see that we can combine them

2107
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:22,799
actually in a more

2108
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:24,559
more efficient way so this is just an

2109
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,119
example of how to

2110
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,400
do this buried your microphone and you

2111
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:31,839
are rushing on it

2112
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,879
all the time sorry carsten i didn't hear

2113
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,199
you

2114
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,560
you just buried your microphone so we

2115
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:39,519
didn't hear you

2116
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,239
and all the time so you may try to keep

2117
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:43,840
it

2118
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:45,678
free of your clothing okay

2119
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:49,040
thank you very much there's something

2120
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,040
touching is this better

2121
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:54,000
yes thank you okay so as i was saying

2122
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:57,360
the

2123
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,880
um try to say is that there is an

2124
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:04,159
option to make these faces

2125
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:07,280
more uh more parallel parallel

2126
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:08,320
in parallel and that's the scope of of

2127
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,559
this

2128
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,679
this presentation so here here is a

2129
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:14,239
slide

2130
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:15,119
showing how different uh different

2131
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:18,638
components

2132
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:20,559
can be different drafts can be used to

2133
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:24,719
make this more efficient

2134
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:28,239
um in the we see we see the ad hoc

2135
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:32,000
exchange the blue messages and

2136
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:33,678
uh we see the enrollment uh the black

2137
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,440
box and the black messages that was that

2138
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:39,920
was previous draft

2139
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,919
and this described here in this session

2140
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,639
but the scope of this this presentation

2141
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,239
is the red box and the red arrows

2142
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:50,639
so that's if you take the next slide

2143
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:50,638
daniel

2144
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,800
so it's actually the question how can we

2145
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,040
make

2146
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,560
uh authorization in parallel to

2147
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:03,920
authentication

2148
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:05,600
in a lightweight way and

2149
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:06,960
in this case we are using the adword

2150
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:09,920
protocol

2151
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,520
and we carry authorization related

2152
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:15,119
information

2153
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,560
in the auxiliary data that's between

2154
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,880
it's all over the constrained link and

2155
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:21,360
then we have an exchange

2156
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:23,040
uh in the backend with the with the

2157
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:25,119
trusted third party the authorization

2158
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:27,440
server

2159
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:29,199
and in this way we can reuse the data

2160
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:30,879
public keys and identifiers

2161
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,719
in the authentication protocol for the

2162
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,880
authorization process

2163
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,480
which makes it more lightweight and we

2164
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,440
can transfer credentials

2165
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:45,519
over the unconstrained link instead of

2166
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:48,799
the constraint next slide please

2167
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:51,840
uh so there are more arrows and uh

2168
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:52,719
colors so what if you look at the

2169
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:56,239
assumptions

2170
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:59,440
it's basically uh we introduced

2171
01:38:56,239 --> 01:39:03,440
the u v

2172
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:05,360
and w here to have easier notation

2173
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:07,599
we have no prior trust relationship

2174
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:11,519
between the device and authenticator

2175
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:13,840
it's basically the setting with the

2176
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,679
device onboarding it's a device coming

2177
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,679
from the factory

2178
01:39:15,679 --> 01:39:19,199
uh we do have a trust relationship

2179
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,960
between the device and the trusted third

2180
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,000
party that's exactly what we're using

2181
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,119
here

2182
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,800
uh authorization server it could be

2183
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:29,280
in the brewski case it's the

2184
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:32,400
manufacturer authorization service

2185
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:35,759
or it could be some other some other uh

2186
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:38,879
trusted third party and v and w

2187
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:41,920
only have sort of a web-based trust

2188
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,440
so that they could look up and have some

2189
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,480
implicit trust anchors and they could

2190
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,239
verify their

2191
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:51,759
yes certificates so the actual

2192
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:53,360
interaction sort of on a sketch sketchy

2193
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,880
level is that

2194
01:39:53,360 --> 01:40:00,880
you is providing information

2195
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:04,400
like an encrypted blob with a locator to

2196
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:08,560
w in the ad hoc auxiliary data

2197
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:11,599
and that's a locator is like a uri

2198
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:15,920
and the authenticator can then

2199
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:18,000
set up tls based on certificates

2200
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,760
with the authorization server and in

2201
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,400
that interaction pass on the encrypted

2202
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:25,679
data from the device

2203
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:26,960
as well as its public key

2204
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,639
and the proof of possession that it's

2205
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:34,000
going to use for authenticate to you

2206
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:36,800
in in in the adult protocol with this

2207
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:39,840
information the authorization server

2208
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:42,480
can so

2209
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:44,320
based on its its trust relationship with

2210
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:49,040
the device it can decrypt

2211
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:49,040
the identifier of the device and

2212
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:52,239
look up the certificate and provide the

2213
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,360
certificate of the

2214
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:57,519
device back to the authenticator it can

2215
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,199
also verify

2216
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,800
the proof of possession of the public

2217
01:40:59,199 --> 01:41:04,638
key and

2218
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:07,679
construct a an access token or a voucher

2219
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:10,719
in form of a mac which will

2220
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:14,000
which is then going back to the

2221
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:19,440
device in the second message

2222
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:23,360
of ad hoc so as the adword protocol runs

2223
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:26,159
uh the device will get the public key of

2224
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:27,759
of the authenticator and at that point

2225
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:30,400
with the help of the voucher it can

2226
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:33,440
authenticate and authorize

2227
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:36,960
the uh the network

2228
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:39,280
and the third message the device

2229
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,600
is supposed to pass its credential or

2230
01:41:39,280 --> 01:41:44,080
identify the credential to

2231
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,159
to the authenticator but in this case

2232
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:47,760
that credential has already been

2233
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:49,519
established through the communication

2234
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,199
with the trusted third party

2235
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,520
so the authenticator can can use that

2236
01:41:51,199 --> 01:41:58,719
certificate to authenticate

2237
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,719
device then ask it

2238
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,800
yeah so just to

2239
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:05,040
check that i'm understanding here the

2240
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,920
authenticator v is sort of playing the

2241
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:09,119
role

2242
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:13,040
kind of like a join proxy for

2243
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:17,119
yeah yes like like a registrar

2244
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,119
in the in the brewski terminology

2245
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:21,360
so it's it's it's the network uh like

2246
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:23,199
like

2247
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,880
doesn't think he means the joint like

2248
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:26,559
the registrar you mean the joint proxy

2249
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:30,159
yes that would be necessary

2250
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:32,560
and it's not shown also

2251
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:34,159
so sorry yes it's not so so there is a

2252
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:36,159
joint proxy which essentially is the

2253
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:38,719
first point of contact

2254
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:41,280
with the network that's uh that's

2255
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:44,159
somewhere on the constrained link

2256
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,519
so that's not in in in this picture the

2257
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:47,040
authenticator would be the

2258
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,800
the registrar which is sort of the back

2259
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:54,639
end which actually communicates with

2260
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,639
uh the third part of the third party

2261
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:58,239
okay for helping me understand i'm also

2262
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:03,280
trying to capture it

2263
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:03,280
in the code emd right thank you thanks

2264
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:06,960
okay next slide

2265
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,320
so this um we think this this could be

2266
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:15,119
useful this protocol

2267
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:17,519
in in different settings and for in this

2268
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:20,799
graph we provide a mapping to

2269
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:24,080
to ace so

2270
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:25,600
uh if you compare the if we map the

2271
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:27,679
authenticator to the client

2272
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,119
the device to the constrain device to

2273
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,480
the resource server

2274
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,559
and the authorization server to the

2275
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:34,638
authorization server

2276
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,520
we get something like this and if you

2277
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:40,480
look at the assumptions it seems to

2278
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:42,000
to match what the assumptions are are

2279
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,360
for ace

2280
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,199
we don't assume a prior trust

2281
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,280
relationship between client and resource

2282
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:49,519
server

2283
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:51,040
the rs provides information about

2284
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,239
location of the aes

2285
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:56,320
to c that's the as request creation

2286
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:58,320
hints

2287
01:43:56,320 --> 01:44:00,960
the rs and the as on the other hand they

2288
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:04,719
have a strong cross relationship

2289
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:08,880
in this case sharing

2290
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:12,239
by the rs having the public key of aes

2291
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:16,159
and the as can can

2292
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:19,759
uh can look up information about the rs

2293
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:21,519
and provide that to the client

2294
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,320
whereas the relationship between the

2295
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:27,119
client and the authorization server is

2296
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,920
is not strictly specified in in the ace

2297
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:31,119
framework

2298
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:34,800
and the one way of resolving that is

2299
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:38,080
some sort of web-based trust so

2300
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,840
so the assumptions uh map match and also

2301
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:43,040
the protocol can can be made to

2302
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:46,840
match fairly fairly well so the

2303
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:49,679
as request creation hints

2304
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:50,960
typically are in response to a request

2305
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,280
from a client

2306
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,639
uh in this case there is no prior

2307
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:59,440
request so it's basically just

2308
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,440
preemptively

2309
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:03,839
providing this information to the client

2310
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:06,799
which can then post

2311
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:08,480
a token containing posts to slash token

2312
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,000
containing this information provided by

2313
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:13,119
the device

2314
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:17,040
and the authorization server can

2315
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:18,239
respond with uh access information in

2316
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:21,040
this case

2317
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:22,159
uh the certificate of the rs and also an

2318
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:25,360
access token which is

2319
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:26,559
in this case it's the voucher and that's

2320
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:31,199
passed by um

2321
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:34,800
back to the to to the device

2322
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:38,239
so this would be then an ace profile

2323
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:40,480
uh over ad hoc in this case

2324
01:45:38,239 --> 01:45:42,480
so that's one way of of embodying this

2325
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:45,839
communication between

2326
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:49,119
between client and and resource

2327
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:49,119
resourcer next slide please

2328
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:53,759
so i'm wrapping up this two more slides

2329
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:57,199
uh this is

2330
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:58,560
just uh so there was a lot of arrows in

2331
01:45:57,199 --> 01:46:01,119
the in the previous pictures

2332
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:01,920
the actual content of the draft uh which

2333
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,320
is

2334
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,159
it's of course work in progress still is

2335
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,239
that we we produce two new auxiliary

2336
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:09,679
data types for ad hoc

2337
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:12,559
which contains this information that

2338
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:14,880
needs to be carried between client and

2339
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,320
and authenticator between device and

2340
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,400
authenticator sorry

2341
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:19,440
and there is what michael called an

2342
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,719
ultra-constrained

2343
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:26,719
voucher matching the brisket

2344
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:29,440
terminology uh which is just a mac

2345
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:32,239
of this uh this data that comes from

2346
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:34,960
from the authentication server

2347
01:46:32,239 --> 01:46:36,879
uh authorization service sorry and then

2348
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,560
with the exchange of data between the

2349
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,080
authenticator and authorization server

2350
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,840
which is independent of transport

2351
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:43,920
but there is an ace map being described

2352
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,800
in this draft

2353
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:48,960
and then some security processing next

2354
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,960
slide

2355
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:56,560
so yes we are still need to

2356
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:59,760
specify cryptocontext and how

2357
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:02,840
this the details of the integrated

2358
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:07,600
encryption scheme can be used h

2359
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:10,800
hpi hpke or not

2360
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:14,320
in this setting which that would be nice

2361
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:17,520
and so that's basically

2362
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:19,119
what we have and

2363
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:21,440
yeah there are some questions do we have

2364
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:24,880
any known implementations of this

2365
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:26,320
there are plans definitely to implement

2366
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:28,639
i don't know if michael want to say more

2367
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:31,840
what what exists and what

2368
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:34,840
does not exist and

2369
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:36,080
ben also commented that rfc yeah the

2370
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,679
voucher

2371
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:39,199
rfc can be useful for more than just

2372
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,400
versky and

2373
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:42,080
if someone wants to say anything about

2374
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,879
that that would be great maybe michael

2375
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:46,559
is the right person

2376
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:48,840
here bear in mind now michael that i've

2377
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,840
already taken all the time for this

2378
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:51,840
presentation

2379
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,920
okay michael do you want to say

2380
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:58,639
something yeah

2381
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,639
google michael

2382
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,119
the question so i don't know what you're

2383
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:06,239
asking and we have no time so

2384
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:07,759
ah yeah okay so yes uh to answer all the

2385
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,799
yes there is there is implementation

2386
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:13,199
plans here

2387
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:14,480
and um please

2388
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:19,839
we can talk about that offline i can

2389
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:19,839
send more information

2390
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:25,280
i didn't hear michael's statement but

2391
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:32,639
saying that if the question was am i

2392
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:35,519
implementing the answers yes

2393
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,400
okay thanks for me thank you so you're

2394
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,719
implementing

2395
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:38,719
um

2396
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,480
this draft

2397
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:53,199
yes i am you know

2398
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,199
six percent into doing it but yes okay

2399
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,840
don't expect it done by the by friday

2400
01:48:56,320 --> 01:49:00,639
[Laughter]

2401
01:48:58,840 --> 01:49:05,440
okay

2402
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:05,440
okay so next friday

2403
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:14,159
marco yes

2404
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:16,239
thank you again uh final presentation uh

2405
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:17,360
this work was presented last time at the

2406
01:49:16,239 --> 01:49:20,320
june interim

2407
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:22,799
uh we had i think uh the problem we are

2408
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:24,960
addressing is that access tokens can be

2409
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:27,520
revoked before their intended expiration

2410
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:29,199
time for a number of reasons clients and

2411
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,440
resource service compromised the

2412
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:33,280
policies of their outcome have changed

2413
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,638
or da's profile to use

2414
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:38,080
uh with that token has changed and

2415
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,760
we are trying to address the problem of

2416
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,880
let both the client and the resource

2417
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,239
server know about

2418
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:47,440
uh such early revoked tokens and

2419
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:49,440
for that we are defining one

2420
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,280
resource and related interface at the

2421
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,519
authorization server

2422
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,960
so there we keep one single docker

2423
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:57,599
revocation list

2424
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:59,679
where we include um identifiers of

2425
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,840
revoked tokens that are not expired yet

2426
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,080
and not identifiers in the sense of the

2427
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:06,400
existing ctis but more

2428
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:07,280
hashes of those tokens uh to put it

2429
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:08,480
simple

2430
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,320
and then both the client and the

2431
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:14,000
resource servers can can

2432
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:16,400
retrieve that list or get and observe

2433
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,440
that list to receive automatic

2434
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:20,000
notifications

2435
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:20,719
in case anything changes and to be

2436
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,320
precise

2437
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:24,480
um here the client and the resource

2438
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:25,679
server and can obtain from the

2439
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,799
authorization server

2440
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:30,800
only the part of that list that really

2441
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:32,719
pertains themselves so for example a

2442
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,199
client can get only

2443
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:37,520
this kind of information for the tokens

2444
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:39,440
it has received in the first place

2445
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:41,040
and this complement the already

2446
01:50:39,440 --> 01:50:43,598
available of course uh

2447
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,159
token introspection editorization server

2448
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:46,000
and

2449
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:47,839
it doesn't require at all any new

2450
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:53,840
endpoint on the client

2451
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:53,840
or there is a server next slide please

2452
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,000
right as i mentioned the identifiers we

2453
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,840
use for tokens here are

2454
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:05,440
harshest computing just following the

2455
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:08,719
binary format of

2456
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:12,000
uh 6920 so naming things with hashes

2457
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:13,679
uh i think uh the exact resource and

2458
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,199
authorization server then uh is

2459
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:19,679
essentially a simple array

2460
01:51:15,199 --> 01:51:22,320
uh including uh a list of token ashes

2461
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:23,280
so a new token hash is added to the list

2462
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,239
when a token is

2463
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:27,679
uh revoked and is done later on removed

2464
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:31,040
when that token

2465
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:32,159
eventually expires the interactions are

2466
01:51:31,040 --> 01:51:33,920
pretty simple

2467
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:36,080
upon registering at the authorization

2468
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:38,719
server however that happens

2469
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:40,000
in in detail is not defined here or

2470
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:41,679
anywhere really

2471
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,040
uh the client and resource server will

2472
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,920
get the exact url

2473
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,599
uh to that trl uh resource at the

2474
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,520
authorization server

2475
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:51,599
and then as i said they can send

2476
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:52,239
requests for the pertaining portion of

2477
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:54,960
that list

2478
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:57,759
or observe it for for changes but we are

2479
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:59,599
actually admitting a special requester

2480
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:00,320
like an administrator that can in fact

2481
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,119
get back

2482
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,960
uh the full content of that list so

2483
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,920
right now we have two different modes of

2484
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,080
operations in

2485
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,400
in full query mode you can get back in

2486
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:12,880
fact all the pertaining portion

2487
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,400
of the list and and the related token

2488
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,800
ash is included there

2489
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:17,519
um in this query mode you can instead

2490
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:21,199
get back

2491
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:23,280
um a set of uh most recent updates

2492
01:52:21,199 --> 01:52:24,480
that happened to that uh part of the

2493
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:26,559
list uh

2494
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:29,440
pertaining to you and we have recently

2495
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:32,239
improved that based on feedback we got

2496
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,239
next slide please

2497
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,639
so uh since version one that that was

2498
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:41,040
presented in fact in the june interim

2499
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:43,920
now we are in in version three

2500
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:45,679
uh the the latest version especially

2501
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:48,000
addresses uh

2502
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:49,040
review comments from from karsten posted

2503
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,119
on the list after the

2504
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,239
interim and comments we got from from

2505
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:55,280
bain also

2506
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:56,480
uh during that same interim uh so we

2507
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:59,679
clarified uh

2508
01:52:56,480 --> 01:53:02,799
even better providing um examples

2509
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:04,639
uh what we exactly take uh as

2510
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,880
input for the hash processing when

2511
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:10,159
computing uh the token ash

2512
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:12,000
considering um the case where uh the

2513
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:15,519
token has been transported uh

2514
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,159
in sieber or in json instead

2515
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,880
and based especially on on custom

2516
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:21,119
feedback

2517
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:22,960
we have simplified the the interface and

2518
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:23,759
the message format for the div query

2519
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:26,000
mode

2520
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,920
so now we have a single query parameter

2521
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,440
uh that specifies the number of

2522
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:33,840
um requested most recent updates

2523
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:36,638
uh in the response and the response

2524
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:39,119
payload uh that used to

2525
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,719
to be based on zebra maps and now is

2526
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:42,880
essentially an array

2527
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:44,400
so so the the outer payload the overall

2528
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:47,119
payload is an array

2529
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:48,559
including the different updates uh

2530
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:51,360
happen to the list

2531
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:52,639
um as individual elements that are in

2532
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:55,280
turns array

2533
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:57,119
and then for each update we specify uh

2534
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:00,480
which token ashes have been

2535
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:05,360
added or removed uh especially for that

2536
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:05,360
for that update next slide please

2537
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,800
so other than that following a

2538
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:13,199
recommendation from men

2539
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:14,800
um when the registration the initial

2540
01:54:13,199 --> 01:54:16,400
registration happened at the

2541
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:18,639
authorization server

2542
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,000
uh what's returned is not only the exact

2543
01:54:18,639 --> 01:54:22,239
url uh

2544
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,360
to this list resource but also the

2545
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:26,638
identifier of the

2546
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:27,519
exact hash algorithm used and we've also

2547
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,280
added more

2548
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:30,880
interaction examples we used to have

2549
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:33,840
only one in full query mode

2550
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:34,880
we we added two in diff query mode also

2551
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,880
using

2552
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:42,000
observation in fact um we also added two

2553
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:44,719
uh big appendices uh the first one

2554
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,159
uh follows carson's review uh where he

2555
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:47,760
was suggesting to check the series

2556
01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:50,799
transfer pattern

2557
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:53,440
and well it was right uh there was also

2558
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,920
inspiring and in appendix a we described

2559
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,239
how

2560
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,599
uh yeah the diff query mode proposed

2561
01:54:56,239 --> 01:55:00,959
here is in fact

2562
01:54:57,599 --> 01:55:03,440
um an instance an example of usage

2563
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:06,960
of that series transfer pattern and we

2564
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:09,919
define the the alignment more in detail

2565
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:11,840
but ben also had some more uh comments

2566
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:14,880
again during that interim

2567
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,880
um he said that the the diff query mode

2568
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:18,639
uh was something useful but probably

2569
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:22,320
something even more can be done

2570
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:25,360
so rather than asking for the the n most

2571
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:27,119
recent updates to the list it would be

2572
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:29,839
good to to ask also for the

2573
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:31,040
n updates following a certain point in

2574
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,840
time for instance

2575
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:36,560
uh the the last uh interaction happened

2576
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:38,239
uh some hours some some days before

2577
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:40,080
and that should cover also the case

2578
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:43,598
where that point in time

2579
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:44,400
is now gone because it it became stale

2580
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:46,560
it just had to

2581
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,320
be removed from the aes and that should

2582
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:51,280
push the requester back to

2583
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:52,639
to to issue a new request in in full

2584
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,159
query mode

2585
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:56,080
and this can actually become a third

2586
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:59,679
mode of its own

2587
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:01,519
uh next slide please yeah so we we

2588
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:03,520
took that into account and that's why we

2589
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,480
introduced the new paint bixby where we

2590
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:07,280
believe we are

2591
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,000
uh in fact defining this uh possible

2592
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:11,840
third mode of operation suggested by ben

2593
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,239
further building on the series transfer

2594
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:17,280
pattern and in particular of its

2595
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:20,718
cursor sub pattern

2596
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:21,280
so the idea is that now based on this

2597
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:24,080
extension

2598
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:26,719
if a full or diff query request are sent

2599
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,760
the response includes also cursor

2600
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:32,480
which is a pointer to uh uh the

2601
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:34,800
latest the latest update happened or the

2602
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:36,239
latest one included in that particular

2603
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,159
response

2604
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:41,360
and and then just following the the

2605
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:43,519
cursor pattern from the stp document

2606
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:44,719
that allows the requester to resume

2607
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:47,360
exactly from

2608
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:48,800
where interrupted and it also allows in

2609
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:49,839
this case the authorization server to

2610
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,119
possible

2611
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:54,960
do transfer transfers in batches so

2612
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:57,119
addressing possible

2613
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:58,639
latency requirements and we are also

2614
01:56:57,119 --> 01:57:01,360
handling some corner cases

2615
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,320
here like well there's no update yet so

2616
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:04,159
the

2617
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,599
the cursor is a bit floating or the

2618
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:06,480
cursor is pointing to the end of the

2619
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:08,639
list already

2620
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:10,080
or the cursor is pointing to something

2621
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,760
that was deleted and

2622
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:14,719
and the requester just have to to

2623
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:18,159
restart from a full query mode

2624
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,800
um yeah and to wrap up we we have the

2625
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:21,759
interface

2626
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:23,360
defined uh also considering all

2627
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:26,400
observation as initial

2628
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:27,920
intention for unsolicited information of

2629
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:30,400
revoked tokens

2630
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:31,520
and this latest version as i mentioned

2631
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,360
included especially

2632
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:35,599
uh review from carson comments from ben

2633
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:37,280
but further builds on an earlier review

2634
01:57:35,599 --> 01:57:39,280
on the list from trevi spencer and

2635
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:41,040
comments and discussion from jim

2636
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:44,159
as immediate next step we would like to

2637
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:46,719
try to move uh that appendix p

2638
01:57:44,159 --> 01:57:48,638
to the document body as an actual third

2639
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:52,159
mode of operation like an enhanced

2640
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:54,480
query mode and all considering the the

2641
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:56,080
current status and the previous reviewed

2642
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,559
we we got in the dress

2643
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:59,840
uh we were thinking this can be

2644
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,920
considered

2645
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:04,159
uh for adoption call in the working

2646
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:04,159
group

2647
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:12,400
okay thank you marco um

2648
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:12,400
unless there are

2649
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:16,320
any comments i'm gonna take the two last

2650
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:19,598
minutes

2651
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:23,599
um to provide some

2652
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:26,560
next steps for the working group

2653
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:27,520
so what i'm planning to do is interim

2654
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:30,639
meeting

2655
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:32,840
on a monthly basis as we used to do

2656
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:34,560
i think that was a pretty much

2657
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,639
productive

2658
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,199
i think the working group before any

2659
01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:39,199
adoption

2660
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:47,760
i mean we should start focusing on

2661
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:51,599
finalizing the work that is being

2662
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:54,880
in progress so i i'm i have in mind

2663
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:56,320
the current working group documents and

2664
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:00,000
um

2665
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:03,759
um the the other um

2666
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:06,639
track for us is to uh recharge

2667
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,840
as soon as possible so i'm gonna send

2668
01:59:06,639 --> 01:59:10,960
the

2669
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:15,520
the charter on the mailing list and

2670
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:20,400
um then um i think that's gonna be on

2671
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:20,400
ben's spot to move that to the isg

2672
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:27,199
um i don't know if ben has anything to

2673
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,199
say now

2674
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:32,719
