1
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,200
we should start i got to figure out

2
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
what's the best way to share the slides

3
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,840
this window

4
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
well if your browser allows you to uh

5
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,238
share just the window then

6
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
that usually works better yeah

7
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
all right

8
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,840
let me as soon as i can get those shared

9
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,839
i will do that and we can start

10
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
yes

11
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:57,840
select window

12
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
all right is that working now

13
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,320
screen share is being started i'm still

14
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,119
not seeing slides though it's thinking

15
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,719
yeah there it is okay there we go yeah

16
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,479

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,160
cool thank you roman all right

18
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,840
now that i've mastered the tricky

19
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
technology i'll just be able to hit the

20
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,400
down button

21
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,080
okay welcome everyone to acme

22
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,039
we have a few presentations about an

23
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,599
hour

24
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,840
so let's um

25
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,280
i know we all wanted to be in bangkok

26
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
but instead we're all on video

27
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,840
so be it

28
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,318
you have all hopefully seen the note

29
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
well by far

30
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,039
before it describes how the iatf

31
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,360
operates what your rights and privileges

32
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,800
and responsibilities are

33
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,400
um by viewing this via meet echo

34
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
you have signed on and entered into

35
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
you know sign the blue sheet and

36
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,280
therefore a legally binding document

37
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,919
should we all get sued so

38
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,919
don't worry about it

39
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,600
administrative tasks uh so we need

40
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,400
one or two note takers uh jove's gonna

41
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,680
do the jabber scribe

42

and i don't believe brian is here so i

113
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,519

114
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,920
on that uh

115
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,920
some new documents were submitted for

116
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,959
working group consideration

117
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,079

onion routing was submitted by roland

121
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
schumacher

122
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,719
who has you know left let's encrypt and

123
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,560
moved on to another job and i

124
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,760
haven't been able to track him down so i

125
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
don't think we'll be having anything on

126
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
that

127
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,680
um i encourage anyone who is interested

128
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,120
in onion stuff and i'm trying to solicit

129
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,439
some volunteers

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,320
um to consider picking it up otherwise

131
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
we'll just have to consider it a banded

132
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
service discovery will have a

133
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
presentation

134
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,480
um and related to that is i guess the

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
server capabilities

136
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
and that will be coming from fraser

137
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,680
teasdale

138
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,040

139
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,880
um well kathleen is not here but she has

140
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,760
to to get feedback on

141
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,399
uh her draft i guess it means

142
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
integrations

143
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,518
uh yes good integrations and and

144
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839

145
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,839
client

146
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,079

173
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
but

174
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:48,959
have we lost here i

175
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,959
stopped his sharing so you can start now

176
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
okay

177
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:20,319
oh there it is okay

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,040
frasier are you available

179
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
okay now

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,800
people can see my screen hopefully

181
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,079
um so quick summary this is an

182
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,399
informational draft

183
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,120
it describes how acme can be integrated

184
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,639
with multiple

185
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
existing clients and device certain

186
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,920
normal mechanisms without requiring any

187
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,720
changes to acme

188
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,719
and the the three main things we're

189
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
looking at is integration with est

190
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,240
integration with brisket and bristly

191
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079
cloud which is really just briskly with

192
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,360
a default cloud registrar

193
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,359
and integration with teep

194
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,599
there's been a few changes since draft

195
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
0.2 we just published draft 0.t very

196
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
very recently and we've added the

197
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,639
security considerations

198
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,439
and this is a quick summary probably

199
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,279
documented um

200
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
the first thing to consider is that acme

201
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,079
disintegrations draft makes no changes

202
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
to the

203
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,079
existing standards we're just primarily

204
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
referring to the security considerations

205
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
that

206
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,479
exist in the existing reference

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,920
standards um

208
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,639
but a couple of things we did explicitly

209
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,399
call out the acme integration service

210
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,160
could be configured with keys for dns

211
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,360
updates in order to handle acme

212
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,880
and challenges so so the operator of

213
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,440
that acme integration server should

214
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,639
consider

215
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,040
restricting the blast radius and the dns

216
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,880
zone that those keys can update

217
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,399
and similarly the actual integration

218
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,399
service could be authorized to write to

219
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,759
http servers for handling http

220
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,920
challenges

221
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
and again the operator should consider

222
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
restricting the blast radius of the

223
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,240
server accesses

224
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,839
um and also the acme integration service

225
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,199
because it's handling requests coming in

226
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
from multiple clients

227
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
and proxying those requests through to

228
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,199
the acme server we need to consider acme

229
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,120
integration dos tax

230
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,959
and we should consider on the acme

231
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
integration service having a certificate

232
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,880
caches to avoid

233
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,399
having to ping and the acme server

234
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
continuously when it's not when it's not

235
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,120
necessary

236
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,480
so those three three consider security

237
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,320
considerations are described in more

238
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
detail in the draft

239
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
and additionally the only other changes

240
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,199
that are made there's a minor tutorial

241
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,399
changes we've fixed up some broken

242
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,479
references

243
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,240
and we've made we've picked up some nits

244
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,199
with the calls and some knits and titles

245
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,480
throughout the doc

246
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,680
but they're only minor editorial and

247
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,240
there's one discussion item do you want

248
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,079
to talk

249
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
talk about it was brought up on some of

250
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,800
the mailers a while back but it didn't

251
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,360
really go anywhere

252
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,519
and it's about cmc ras that that eku

253
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
um so when you look when particularly

254
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
when you look at brisky

255
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,440
um and it also mentions this in est

256
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,519
that when est or brewski goes to um

257
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,199
enroll for a certificate when the easter

258
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,399
brewski client goes from role for

259
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,199
certificate against the east to your

260
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:03,600
brewski servers and the client

261
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
or the pledge should check for the cmc

262
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
ra

263
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,280
eku and i've what i've quoted there is

264
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
the explicit text from est

265
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,678
the explicit text from brewski that

266
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
outlines how the cmc ra should be

267
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,959
checked

268
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
now when you consider acme acme says

269
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
nothing about eku's at all

270
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,160
and currently if you look at say the

271
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,760
bold implementation for let's encrypt

272
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,079
acme server policy and server

273
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,720
implementation decides what he can use

274
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,120
to accept and to include in csrs

275
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,640
so when we're looking at him est or

276
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,918
brewski

277
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,320
integration with acme um we just need to

278
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,440
think about

279
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,520
if the registrar itself is going to be

280
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,799
enrolling automatically with acme to get

281
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,440
its own identity certificate

282
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,520
um should that register be requesting a

283
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
cmc ra from acme currently that's

284
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,000
encrypt won't give

285
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,600
out a cmc or a um eku

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
um and what does that really mean when

287
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
you're when you're getting a certificate

288
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,160
from a public

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
acme certificate authority such as let's

290
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
encrypt and should the pledge really be

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,640
checking for this anymore

292
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,080
so that's just a general discussion

293
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,760
point that we probably need to bring to

294
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
the brewski anima mailers

295
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,879
and the iot onboarding mailers but i

296
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,400
just wanted to call it out here because

297
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
we don't have a good answer for this yet

298
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
we haven't thought about it

299
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,000
deeply enough

300
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,200
and next steps is reviewers please and

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
feedback please

302
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,799
and there is an old email thread on um

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,280
brisket

304
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,639
on this cmc ra that we must bring to the

305
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,320
top emitters again

306
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
because we do want some input on this we

307
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,439
do need to close this before we close on

308
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,400
the um

309
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
um acme brewski and acme est

310
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,960
integrations

311
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
sections and that's it

312
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,280
okay thank you and see that we have

313
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,080
it i'm going to stop the share so that i

314
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,520
can take a look at the chat again

315
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,480
and that's it back to you rich

316
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,520
i am done no you're not because we have

317
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,520
a question for michael

318
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,280
oh um uh owen uh asked me

319
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,799
a couple days ago about this point and i

320
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,080
went oh

321
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,559
um yeah this is a real issue um and

322
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,199
so i have an email half written to that

323
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,720
about this

324
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,559
issue and ironically

325
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,559
allows the registrar to have a

326
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,480
self-signed certificate

327
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,799
and um that is actually part of the

328
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,480
the leverage point so you can have this

329
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,960
bizarre situation where you could have a

330
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,960
registrar that's giving out

331
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,160
certificates to clients that it got via

332
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,600
acme while itself not using one

333
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,960
um which really feels bizarre um

334
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,320
and uh so i think that you know

335
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
that's a discussion that i think we

336
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,280
should have and in the

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,240
uh not yet adopted uh acme subdomains

338
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,280
thing um it's it's possible that that

339
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,360
maybe

340
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,840
that uh the authorization process that

341
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,399
would

342
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,600
allow you to uh through one

343
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
authorization doing

344
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,320
quite a number of sub-domains not a wild

345
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
card but many certificates maybe that

346
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
actually should set that bit

347
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,280
um but then there's some other issues

348
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,240
about what that bit really means that

349
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
maybe

350
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
our it means actually really we

351
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,399
shouldn't set that bit

352
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,120
and we maybe we need another bit uh i

353
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,280
don't know

354
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,879
um but i think that's a conversation i'd

355
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,879
like i like i'm going to start on the

356
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
list

357
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
okay yeah thank you moment um

358
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,039
anything else okay so i guess uh the

359
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,640
next one is what uh subdomains

360
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,640
yeah supplements okay i will

361
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:31,840
share again

362
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,239
so rich i think you need to one of the

363
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,440
chairs needs to approve me i just

364
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
requested

365
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
share

366
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,120
oh okay i just grab it

367
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,120
okay

368
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,959
okay so subdomains three

369
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,879
we published a new version of this a

370
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,720
couple of months ago

371
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,320
um so the summary act made house

372
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,159
an acting server to issue certs for a

373
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,678
given identifier each a subdomain

374
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
without requiring a challenge to be

375
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,360
explicitly

376
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,120
fulfilled against that identifier for

377
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,918
example an acme server could issue a

378
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
search for

379
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,880
through one.future.example.com or the

380
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
acme client only has to fill a challenge

381
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,159
against one of the parent domains for

382
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,320
example birth or example.com or

383
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,840
example.com

384
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,439
an acme server cliche search for a

385
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,439
number of sub-domain certs and only

386
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,880
require a single challenge to be

387
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
fulfilled against the parent domain

388
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
which is a nice optimization and has a

389
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
scaled benefits

390
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
when we want to issue a large number of

391
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,120
identity certs

392
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,400
and this is related to the device

393
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,158
integration stuff we were talking about

394
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,720
in the last presentation

395
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
um acme result domains may optionally be

396
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
used with pre-authorizations but

397
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,919
pre-authorizations are not necessarily

398
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,678
required

399
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,440
i just quoted the relevant section the

400
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,320
relevant text from rfc855

401
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,679
uh x on order objects and leave it in

402
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
bold here that's important

403
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,880
the authorization is required or to

404
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
serve a policy

405
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,600
and there may not be a one-to-one

406
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,039
relationship between the order

407
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,158
identifiers and the authorizations

408
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,480
required

409
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,840
so what that means is that the order

410
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,559
output could be for sub-domain and the

411
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,080
authorization required could be foreign

412
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,918
some changes since since changes in

413
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,639
three since ik108

414
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,400
we've incorporated the meter feedback on

415
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
zero two i know ross gave quite a bit of

416
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,520
feedback

417
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,440
we've updated the terminology section

418
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,080
and we've added security sections and

419
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,520
there's

420
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,720
there's some open items that i do want

421
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,240
to talk about that were discussed on the

422
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,520
mirror but we didn't really reach any

423
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,279
concrete conclusion um i just for

424
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
terminology clarification what i added

425
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,960
was uh

426
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,480
some ca browser forum based on

427
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
requirements definitions i reference

428
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
these for

429
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,120
base domain domain name and domain

430
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,200
name space and just for clarity what i'm

431
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,639
finding a sub domain as is a domain that

432
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
is in a domain name specific given

433
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,600
parent domain

434
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,760
for domain name space domain name and

435
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,320
parent domain are the ca browser forum

436
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,320
definitions

437
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,239
um security considerations we've added

438
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,919
quite a bit here but um

439
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,679
in summary acme for some domains has

440
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,600
exactly the same two security goals as

441
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,960
acme and i've quoted these two security

442
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,439
goals from acme

443
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,960
verbatim so only an entity that controls

444
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,880
an identifier can get an authorization

445
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
of that identifier and once authorized

446
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
and account keys authorizations cannot

447
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,360
be improper use by another account so

448
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,279
exactly the same security goals um

449
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,399
we don't propose making any changes to

450
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,120
our counter key management

451
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,720
channel establishment and validation

452
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,760
channel establishment or the security

453
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,679
mechanisms or threat models there

454
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,039
and for acme server policy decisions we

455
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,400
just clarified because there was some

456
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,120
confusion on the mailer about this as

457
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,799
well

458
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,279
the document may be applicable to public

459
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,960
cas privacy is for issuance of iot

460
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,600
search etc

461
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,159
um the baseline requirements may not

462
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,559
necessarily

463
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
be applicable and specific server

464
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,600
policies are outside of the scope of the

465
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,880
documents we just clarified all that in

466
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,120
the security consideration section

467
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
and there's two main open items which

468
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,199
were which were discussed over and back

469
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,120
on demeter over the last few months

470
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,320
and first is does the client need a

471
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,678
mechanism to indicate

472
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,080
that they want to authorize a parent

473
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
domain and not the explicit sub-domain

474
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,720
identifier

475
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,320
or does the client need a mechanism to

476
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,240
indicate that they're happy to authorize

477
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
against the choice of identifiers

478
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,120
so for example for the food through one

479
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,039
the future that bar the example.com

480
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,399
should we enhance the acme protocols

481
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,400
that the client

482
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,919
is able to specify anywhere from one to

483
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,159
four identifiers that they're willing to

484
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,919
fulfill challenges against

485
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
and the second question is that was

486
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,960
raised on the mirrors is does the server

487
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,640
need a mechanism

488
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,080
to provide a choice of identifiers to

489
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,840
the client and let the client choose

490
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
which challenge to fulfill

491
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,840
so for the same example again should the

492
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,439
server be able to specify anywhere from

493
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,600
one to four identifiers that the client

494
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,520
can pick from to fulfill

495
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,520
so both one and two require json object

496
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,320
definition changes to the baseline acme

497
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
spec

498
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
and they're not currently covered in the

499
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,000
sub domains document

500
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,918
currently the document only defines how

501
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,760
a client can submit a new order or new

502
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,440
authorization for a sub domain

503
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,879
and the server can choose any of the

504
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,080
parent identifiers that requires a

505
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,360
challenge for the madam but

506
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,399
can use just one and so we're not giving

507
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
the client

508
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,080
we're not giving the client a mechanism

509
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
to offer a choice of identifiers that

510
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,320
you're willing to fulfill

511
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,158
similarly we're not giving the server um

512
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,879
the option to

513
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,640
choose or to provide a choice of

514
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,320
identifiers that they're willing

515
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,240
for the client to pick and choose from

516
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,200
and if we want to do that it requires

517
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,279
some changes to the json

518
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,679
and next steps is just discussion on the

519
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,919
open items

520
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,120
and based on the discussion the open

521
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,480
items what we actually want to do with

522
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,639
this document because it's still not

523
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,799
adopted

524
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,840
okay i'll just leave the open items

525
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
shared out there

526
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
and that's it that's the presentation

527
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
pretty quick

528
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,159
any comments because i know there were

529
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,120
comments in the jab room

530
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,559
might as well make them at the mic

531
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,559
unless you want me to relay them

532
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,000
yeah but i can see the comments in the

533
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,000
chat room seem to be about the previous

534
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,919
one where we're asking about

535
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,679
ra eku's right so

536
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,840
so that's the open question from the um

537
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,480
from the the integrations one that

538
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,320
slider popular integrated to cmcra

539
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,760
and and currently acme says nothing at

540
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,799
all about uh

541
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,480
about um ekus it's entirely up to the

542
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,840
server policy and we actually don't know

543
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,440
whether

544
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
i i don't know whether we need to try

545
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,520
and explicitly extend the acme spec to

546
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,200
see anything that he can use you're

547
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
requesting or explicitly extend the

548
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,679
specs

549
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,960
server can advertise what he's willing

550
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,200
to offer

551
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,240
um but we're not proposing that because

552
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,279
we haven't really

553
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,679
discussed the eku's and specifically for

554
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,600
the cmcra on the matters at all yet so

555
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,440
at the moment we're not proposing or

556
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
suggesting any changes to acme to do at

557
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,840
equus

558
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,879
and currently that policy is just acme

559
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
internal server policy

560
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,080
and we're not entirely sure how to

561
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,520
handle the cmc rx yet which is why we

562
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,199
need that discussion

563
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,799
and but in the sub domains in sub

564
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,880
domains we're not talking about

565
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,720
equals at all in the sub dimension we're

566
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:47,200
not really talking about eqs at all

567
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,200
the only open items are the choice of

568
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
identifiers

569
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,640
so is anyone any opinions or comments on

570
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,918
these two open items for sub domains

571
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,360
that were i think it was was it jerome

572
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:27,840
and ryan who raised these on demanders

573
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:27,840
possibly and trying to recall

574
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,039
uh

575
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,480
just to comment about the eku's and

576
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,640
whether

577
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,039
we want a mechanism for service to

578
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,720
express

579
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:55,200
things like what eku's it will put

580
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:58,080
on the cert uh i have a draft

581
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,360
uh which i'll speak to very briefly

582
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
later

583
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
about

584
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:09,760
a mechanism for servers to express their

585
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,799
capabilities in the directory meta field

586
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,200
and in that draft i also talk about

587
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,480
the possibility of servers expressing

588
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,520
their policy

589
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,640
that's out of scope for the draft

590
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,918
but i do suggest that it might be a

591
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,120
topic of

592
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,840
interest for future work

593
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,039
so i'm i'm definitely on board with

594
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,279
discussing

595
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,720
ways for service to express their

596
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,440
policies so clients

597
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,960
can make more nuanced decisions about

598
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,760
whether or how to interact

599
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
with the server

600
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:51,840
okay it sounds interesting i'll read

601
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,840
those when they come out

602
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,360
uh to move forward oh and maybe just

603
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,559
start two email threads one on each open

604
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,840
item

605
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,678
and let's see what the group says if

606
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,918
anything

607
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,919
okay

608
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,399
okay i'll stop sharing i'm finished

609
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,399
thank you

610
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,159
brian sipos you want to give an update

611
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,000
we missed

612
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,000
earlier that you were here sorry

613
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,840
uh i'm on can you hear me

614
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,279
okay um so the

615
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,720
good news is that the the primary dtn

616
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,880
drafts are making their way

617
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:51,519
through the iesg review now the security

618
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,360
uh review on the primary users of

619
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,120
these certificates that are being

620
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,080
discussed for acme

621
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,600
issuance uh are being worked out uh

622
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,120
there's a lot of detail that's that's

623
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,719
being hammered down

624
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,600
um which is good uh but what that means

625
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,799
is that

626
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,639
the uh the acme use of those

627
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,840
certificates is is really going to rely

628
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,919
on those details being

629
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,720
finalized and i also saw that the s mime

630
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,159
draft

631
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
uh having gone through for acme uh

632
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,320
uh progressed further is going to help

633
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,360
out because the the dtn use case

634
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,080
is very similar in flow though a

635
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,559
completely different

636
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,360
encoding than the s mime use case

637
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,320
so all the secondary activity is is

638
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,840
progressing

639
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:44,080
uh which is good for the final use

640
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,080
that dtn will have of acme

641
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,159
but that means no change to the draft in

642
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,480
the very near term

643
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,480
okay

644
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,240
yo if you want a solicit discussion on

645
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,240
the client

646
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,720
uh the client document kathleen stock

647
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,080
yeah sure just uh let me share my screen

648
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,440
this time

649
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,960
uh this one right

650
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:24,799
yes i did okay

651
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:28,080
um can you assist because i can't

652
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:32,158
um can you see the screen it's

653
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,158
still being started okay

654
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,039
so let me know when you can see it

655
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,760
i thought they did comment said you need

656
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,480
to pick the screen app you want to share

657
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,600
okay

658
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,039
okay and

659
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,039
that's the one i think yeah

660
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,959
okay yes okay

661
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,839
so um this is the the draft and uh what

662
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,760
kathleen wanted to know is uh i'm going

663
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,440
to do solicit comments and the other

664
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,800
thing to

665
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,839
answer the question whether we think

666
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,839
it's ready for working group last call

667
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,839
so anyone

668
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
okay

669
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,319
okay that's

670
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,920
not a lot of participation and i guess

671
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,440
we'll take it to the

672
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,560
list i'll just

673
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,560
stop my sharing

674
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,920
[Music]

675
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,879
okay which leaves us just with the acme

676
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,880
service discovery

677
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,839
so i need to start a screen share

678
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,839
oh

679
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:01,200
okay

680
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,200
back to the beginning

681
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,920
uh so just presenting my

682
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,880
draft for a service discovery mechanism

683
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
for acme so why do we need service

684
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,480
discovery

685
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,479
the acme ecosystem is growing and there

686
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,520
are now multiple

687
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:28,079
publicly trusted cas with acme endpoints

688
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,280
and also private enterprise pkis

689
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,040
are beginning to implement acme

690
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,280
so we have environments that may have

691
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,200
access to multiple acme

692
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,000
servers furthermore we're standardizing

693
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,640
new kinds of identifier types and

694
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,320
validation methods

695
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,680
so clients need to know what service can

696
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,440
i use

697
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,319
to acquire an email certificate for s

698
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,400
mine

699
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,400
or to acquire a dns certificate

700
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,480
explicit client configuration can be

701
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,280
challenging

702
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,079
not always some environments with

703
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,440
centralized

704
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,440
configuration management

705
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,040
are likely to use that to push

706
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,839
configuration to clients

707
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,119
and the disposition that says well i

708
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,240
don't want any

709
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,440
auto discovery i want to make sure that

710
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,680
my client is explicitly configured

711
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,440
is valid but in other cases

712
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,799
that doesn't work so well or it doesn't

713
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,800
scale

714
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,079
so you can think of devices maybe

715
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,400
printers

716
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:46,160
you know iot things even a light bulb

717
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,760
entering a network and

718
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,839
this thing could be quite difficult to

719
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,320
explicitly tell you need to use this

720
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,440
acme server over here

721
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,160
but you may still wish to be able to

722
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,960
have it

723
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,078
talk acme and opportunistically acquire

724
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,880
a certificate

725
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,400
to secure communications with that

726
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,520
device

727
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,960
uh another situation is uh an

728
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,200
organization with a

729
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,200
bring your own device kind of network

730
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,598
where people are coming in with

731
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,439
who knows what software that can't

732
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,680
necessarily be

733
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,119
managed by their configuration

734
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,879
management system

735
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,720
and yet you know their email clients

736
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,680
they might want their users to talk

737
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
smite

738
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,279
okay if you're a big enterprise network

739
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,118
using outlook everywhere you might be

740
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,760
able to push that configuration out

741
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,000
through

742
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,280
active directory well what if some of

743
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,320
your users have brought their own

744
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,440
computers and they're running

745
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,400
thunderbird

746
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,599
or mutt so these are the kinds of use

747
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,400
cases that

748
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,880
service discovery can be useful for the

749
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,079
goal

750
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,960
is that where you want service discovery

751
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,440
it enables automatic selection of the

752
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,359
best

753
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,839
server in the environment best being

754
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:56,480
defined by the network administrators

755
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,839
and how they

756
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,839
express the services that are available

757
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,599
so there are a bunch of different

758
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,160
service discovery protocols

759
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,800
some are peer-to-peer or distributed

760
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,240
such as

761
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,839
dns service discovery over multicast dns

762
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,240
some use a central registry some are

763
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,078
specifically tied to particular

764
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,839
communications technology such as

765
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,240
bluetooth

766
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,520
and some are general using existing

767
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,799
naming systems

768
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,920
such as the dns so

769
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,320
in the enterprise environments dns srv

770
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,599
records have been used for a long time

771
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,040
for auto discovery of ldap servers

772
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,040
with the organization's directory

773
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,200
the kerberos key distribution centers

774
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,880
mail servers and probably

775
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,960
other things that i don't even know

776
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,839
about

777
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:57,359
rfc 6763 defines dns service discovery

778
00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:00,560
and it uses

779
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,359
pointer records for listing of

780
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,720
available service instances in a given

781
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,560
domain

782
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,799
and srv records and txt records with

783
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,319
supplementary data

784
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,640
to give information about where those

785
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,640
service instances are located

786
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,920
and any other data that might be of

787
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,078
interest to clients

788
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,359
for that particular service type

789
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,760
uh so acme service discovery uh is built

790
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,839
upon

791
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,040
dns service discovery or dns sd

792
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,960
so uh there are a few assumptions here

793
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,000
the assumptions are that the acme client

794
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,560
has its network configured

795
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,319
and that its network configuration

796
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,359
includes a domain name

797
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,480
or a kerberos realm name

798
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:52,960
or something that it can use to decide

799
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,440
i'm going to look for services in this

800
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,440
domain

801
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,040
the assumption is that the organization

802
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,000
can manage its own

803
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,839
dns records to advertise the services

804
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,440
and we also make an assumption that

805
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:14,078
successful retrieval

806
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,960
of a directory object by an acme client

807
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,599
implies that the service or the server

808
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,640
is

809
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,680
up and running and available

810
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,680
for the client to use

811
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,880
so the first step for the client is to

812
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,040
determine its parent domains

813
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,160
these could be given by explicit

814
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,880
configuration

815
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,000
or as i've alluded something that comes

816
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,720
via the network

817
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,680
configuration or the kerberos realm

818
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
basically

819
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,480
some way for the client to decide here

820
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,879
is a domain name or here is a series of

821
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,400
domain names that i will search

822
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,400
for acme services in

823
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,480
it then searches for pointer records

824
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:03,520
with the owner underscore acme server

825
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,800
dot underscore tcp dot the parent domain

826
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:10,400
and i'll just give an example here of

827
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,520
this domain corp.example

828
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,240
advertising two acme server instances

829
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,119
one called corp ca and the other one

830
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,000
called

831
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,000
c4a

832
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,520
so each of those servants our service

833
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,119
instance names

834
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,520
owns an srv record and a txt

835
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,520
record that describe where that service

836
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,040
is located

837
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,759
gives the path to the directory object

838
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:45,040
and gives a list of the

839
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,359
acme identifier types that

840
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:52,880
that acme server supports

841
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,640
so this will allow the client to

842
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,520
construct the url to reach the directory

843
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,520
object

844
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,880
and also make a decision about whether

845
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,920
it will even

846
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,280
attempt to use that server

847
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,839
for example if this is a

848
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,280
an smi email client there's no point

849
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,520
that it would try and contact

850
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,240
a server that's only offering dns

851
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,240
identifiers

852
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,240
an important thing here is that this

853
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,720
specification

854
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:31,040
re-scopes the meaning of the srv

855
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:35,040
priority field across

856
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,880
multiple owners whereas traditionally

857
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,079
it would only be for multiple srv

858
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,040
records in the same

859
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,680
owner scoping it across multiple owners

860
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,560
allows the administrator

861
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,520
who is setting up these advertisements

862
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,520
to define

863
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,118
priority among different service

864
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,200
instances

865
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,880
and the uh the draft goes into a bit of

866
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,240
detail about that and also

867
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,839
some security consequences

868
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,839
of this rescuing of the priority field

869
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,839
so from here the client will choose the

870
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,359
best server that is the highest priority

871
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,759
server that is advertising capabilities

872
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,598
that

873
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:27,280
meet its needs and constructs the

874
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:30,160
directory url attempts to get the

875
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,119
directory object and pass it to see if

876
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,598
it is a valid acme directory object

877
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,760
and if so all good that is the server

878
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,920
that the client will try to use

879
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,000
otherwise it will try the next server

880
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,720
and if it exhausts all of the service

881
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,760
instances

882
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,919
advertised in the current parent domain

883
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,119
and it has other parent domains to try

884
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,760
then it can

885
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,119
go across to the next parent domain and

886
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,640
repeat the

887
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,560
dns service discovery for that

888
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,319
parent domain and once it runs out of

889
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,040
parent domains then it can either give

890
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,400
up

891
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,279
or fall back to a default such as

892
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,240
uh let's encrypt if it's if this is for

893
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,560
a dns

894
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,560
client

895
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,160
so i have some working code for this i

896
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,520
have a fork of certbot where i hacked in

897
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,759
the service discovery uh i don't

898
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,880
know if i will submit a pull request but

899
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,520
if you

900
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,800
hack on certbot i would be interested in

901
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,359
your feedback

902
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,240
on the feature uh and and the draft in

903
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,000
general

904
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,520
and also on how i have gone about that

905
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,760
and i wrote this blog post uh that

906
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,119
gives a bit more detail and some

907
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,200
demonstration of that running code

908
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,119
and if there is time and if you really

909
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,200
want to see it then

910
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,119
i can do a demo for you today but i'd

911
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,160
probably rather start

912
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,200
just discussing some some of the

913
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,399
uh things that need discussion

914
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,160
in this draft so i'm i'm very interested

915
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,720
to hear what other people think about

916
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,839
this

917
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:10,160
uh re-scoping of

918
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:14,078
the semantics of the srb priority

919
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:18,160
field we also need to think about

920
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:22,240
multicast dns so dns sd

921
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:25,359
works for multicast dns and unicast

922
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,560
this specification

923
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,240
restricts it to unicast unless there is

924
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,720
explicit

925
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,118
configuration telling the client that it

926
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,040
can do it on multicast but i think we

927
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,560
need to

928
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:44,079
restrict service discovery to domains

929
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,599
not ending in dot local

930
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:51,200
and we need to restrict or filter out

931
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:56,800
service instance names that end in

932
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:59,480
local as well so that acme clients

933
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,599
performing service discovery don't

934
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,680
inadvertently accept

935
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,040
service instance names that have been

936
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:10,078
advertised

937
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,400
over multicast dns

938
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,240
just in a first come first serve basis

939
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,240
by peers on the local link

940
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,640
the security considerations talk about

941
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,920
dns security

942
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:29,839
i'm curious whether people think

943
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:35,440
it's worthwhile or important to mention

944
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,440
uh dns over tls and dns over

945
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,400
https

946
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,598
i see in the chat rust does dot home

947
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,640
have similar concerns

948
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:47,760
yes uh possibly stroke

949
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,520
probably uh

950
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,440
and yeah the whole question of parent

951
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,480
domain selection this draft does

952
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,880
not uh seek to

953
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,440
specify or constrain how clients would

954
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,480
do this but i would like to give

955
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,800
good examples of how a client could do

956
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,000
this

957
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:09,920
that aren't completely insecure and

958
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,800
a terrible idea because

959
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,400
people will sometimes mindlessly follow

960
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,000
the examples

961
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,240
so yeah we just don't want to give

962
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,960
people loaded foot guns

963
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,839
uh so the next steps is for people to

964
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,839
give feedback

965
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
and for the working group to consider

966
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,960
whether you would like to adopt this

967
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,920
draft

968
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,000
uh i have the source for this draft in a

969
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:38,559
github repository the link is there

970
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,559
and you can create issues there some

971
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,599
people requests if you wish

972
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,040
i'd be very happy to

973
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:51,079
collaborate with people to

974
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,200
improve and advance this draft

975
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:57,440
a brief note on other work

976
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,359
i have another draft i don't want to

977
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,960
elaborate it much today

978
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,799
that can go on the mailing list but it's

979
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,520
about

980
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,559
giving servers a way to express their

981
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,240
capabilities

982
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:12,720
in the directory object so this is

983
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,919
not related to or required for service

984
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,040
discovery but

985
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,599
it is another way for clients to make a

986
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,759
decision

987
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:25,359
earlier on about whether a server is

988
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,880
suitable to be used by that client

989
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,880
rather than just trying to

990
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,279
submit an order for a dns name to an smi

991
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,680
macmi server for example

992
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,440
i'm also curious if anyone is interested

993
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,640
in working to

994
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,319
specify srv name support for acme

995
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,839
this is something we've talked about a

996
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:48,400
little bit at red hat we think it would

997
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:52,160
solve some problems that we have

998
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,280
um obviously this would need to go hand

999
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,558
in hand with

1000
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,520
proper support in popular tls

1001
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,559
libraries for srv name verification as

1002
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,559
well

1003
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,480
but uh you know we have people at red

1004
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,920
hat whose whole job it is just to work

1005
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,200
in maintaining

1006
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,760
open ssl and nss so

1007
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,720
you know if if we agree it's a good idea

1008
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,400
then

1009
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,399
um where there's a will there's a way

1010
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,760
uh but again that's something we could

1011
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,839
probably discuss on the mailing list

1012
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:27,119
just wanted to flag it as something that

1013
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:31,440
we're interested in

1014
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,440
and that's all thank you

1015
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,040
gee i'm not sure well i don't yeah we'll

1016
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,359
use i guess the show of hands tool

1017
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,200
do a quick poll uh how many people have

1018
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:55,839
read the draft

1019
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:55,839
give me uh

1020
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:09,839
uh raise your hand if you have do not

1021
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,839
raise your hand if you have not

1022
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,520
all right not i don't think enough

1023
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:24,000
people have really read it yet to

1024
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,480
discuss uh to consider adoption

1025
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,760
frazier could you post an individual

1026
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,119
draft

1027
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,240
uh via the data tracker

1028
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,559
um and then we can and then mail to the

1029
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,240
list

1030
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,920
asking people to read it and let's see

1031
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,879
if we get feedback there

1032
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,559
um or if you want to if you prefer just

1033
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,440
post a note to the list saying you've

1034
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,280
got the draft

1035
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,520
but you know we have some discussion

1036
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,839
let's see what the github

1037
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,839
interactions are

1038
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,720
good feelings about the idea if not the

1039
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,839
particular draft

1040
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,720
on the jaba room so there is interest in

1041
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,920
doing this

1042
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,919
uh maybe in acme

1043
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,720
yeah that was going to be my kind and

1044
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,440
since we have a queue here i'm

1045
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,919
popping in um so this is richard barnes

1046
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,280
from

1047
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:27,440
cisco um i think this is a really

1048
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,319
uh good idea i think this is a problem

1049
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,640
that

1050
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,040
is worth solving that is certainly

1051
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,879
emerging in some uh enterprise use cases

1052
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,359
i i've seen some of the same challenges

1053
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:41,040
i expect of fraser has seen

1054
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:41,839
um i haven't looked in detail at the

1055
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,800
exact best

1056
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,000
mechanism for discovery here so i agree

1057
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,880
there's a need for some sort of

1058
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,559
discovery here i

1059
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,480
haven't looked exactly at the details

1060
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,440
the dns based thing here

1061
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,720
um the main thing i think worries me

1062
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,680
about this is the choice

1063
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,598
of the the the starting point the name

1064
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,720
the name you use for lookup

1065
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,400
and for that i wonder if for at least

1066
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,598
some identifier types

1067
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,440
we could leverage the identifier you're

1068
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,520
looking to authenticate

1069
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,800
uh as a starting point so for example

1070
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,680
with a domain name uh

1071
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,280
identifier you could use the domain name

1072
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,399
itself or or some

1073
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,680
parent domain or for email address

1074
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,920
identifiers you could potentially use

1075
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,240
the domain of the email address

1076
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,440
as the starting point um you know with

1077
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,078
with appropriate

1078
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,440
you know underscore prefixes um just

1079
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,240
just suggestion there

1080
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,839
um the the identifier type stuff i

1081
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,000
wonder if that might be better in meta

1082
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,480
as opposed to in the discovery system

1083
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,200
um since it's just one more http query

1084
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,400
so

1085
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,680
in general i think this is on the right

1086
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,119
track and i think it's probably a

1087
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,118
problem with solving this working group

1088
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,839
uh mark you're next

1089
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:11,839
okay any any other comments

1090
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,520
i guess all the others in the queue

1091
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,079
wanted to say essentially the same thing

1092
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,079
as richard

1093
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
okay

1094
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,520
all right uh we have hit

1095
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:38,558
the end of the agenda and

1096
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,079
this is not any other business part

1097
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:42,079
yeah normally we'd be like okay let's

1098
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,599
rush to get the cookies oh mark said he

1099
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,440
agrees with richard so

1100
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,160
okay um but since any cookies are

1101
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,079
either in the wrong time zone or have to

1102
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,000
make them yourself

1103
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,119
is there any other business it's always

1104
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,119
the right time for cookies

1105
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,559
yes daniel hi there

1106
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,160
i realize i am way behind on uh keeping

1107
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,359
up with what's going on in the acme

1108
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,720
and i recognize that the s9

1109
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:20,160
draft is very far advanced

1110
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:23,279
um but recent discussion on the

1111
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:27,118
lamps mailing list suggests that um

1112
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:30,640
the preferred configuration for

1113
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,839
uh email users is uh to have two

1114
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,000
certificates

1115
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,520
that is one for encryption and one for

1116
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,400
signing

1117
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,079
and i'm trying to find in the s mine

1118
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,799
draft how it deals with

1119
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:44,480
a dual certificate situation and i don't

1120
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,240
see it

1121
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,760
so i'm wondering if this is if i'm just

1122
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,279
missing it or

1123
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,040
if this is something that we need to

1124
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,720
actually think about for s time i don't

1125
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,000
mean to pull it back when it's this far

1126
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,359
advanced but i'm just trying to figure

1127
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,359
out how how i would do that

1128
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,759
as a male user agent implementer how i

1129
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,040
would get a dual certificate like

1130
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,040
dual certificates like that

1131
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,359
very interesting question i haven't

1132
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,599
talked about this so

1133
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:20,319
yes now would be a good time to

1134
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,359
clarify this i think might need a small

1135
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:23,680
extension

1136
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,680
field

1137
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,520
yeah i wonder if that's just an

1138
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,119
informative note to say that

1139
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,720
um you know once you've validated an

1140
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:38,240
email identifier you can issue different

1141
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:39,839
certs under it for different key types

1142
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,078
well i was just wondering if there is a

1143
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,920
need to signal that you want for one

1144
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,760
purpose or for another and what is this

1145
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:49,359
for reflection certificate

1146
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,359
that's my only thought

1147
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:58,160
um i will raise this on the acme mailing

1148
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:01,759
list i suppose

1149
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,839
um i'm not i i apologize for being

1150
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,960
you know for being this late in the in

1151
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:13,839
the process but i'm just

1152
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:13,839
not sure how how to get that done

1153
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,240
yeah roman

1154
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,079
uh per dkg's feedback if we want to talk

1155
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,400
about a little bit on the mailing list

1156
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,000
uh and come to some agreement we can

1157
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:40,559
just bring the document back i'm happy

1158
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:43,040
to do it

1159
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,000
alexis said i have him in the notes is

1160
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,040
it's a good question

1161
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,160
so um daniel bring it up and we'll give

1162
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,000
a lexi first

1163
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:57,040
whack at it i guess

1164
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,040
okay will do

1165
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:09,839
thanks anything else

1166
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,839
any other business

1167
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,279
so i guess we got two minutes of our

1168
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,959
lives back thank you everyone for coming

1169
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:22,559
no need to sign the blue sheets because

1170
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:24,160
they're generated automatically

1171
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,720
thank you and for your patience with the

1172
