a couple of minutes here discussing uh

75
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
the agenda and the way we want to work

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,519
this

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
off then we are going to move into the

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,159
background of the mac address

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,159
randomization

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,920
for this we're going to have a amelia

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,760
understood presenting the

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,040
background and status about mac address

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,079
randomization

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,679
activities in ieee 802 and

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,440
wba followed by dave teller uh

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
talking about mac address randomization

87
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
in windows 10

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,680
then we're going to have some minutes

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,799
for clarification q a only on this

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,000
background part so that

91
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
you can get those out of the way as we

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
move

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,319
on to the next section which is going to

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,720
be the use cases

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,359
for this we're going to talk about home

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
network

97
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
community wi-fi hospitality cloud

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,360
management use cases

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,000
that are potentially impacted by

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,200
the mac address randomization and for

101
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,439
this we're going to have

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,119
jason uh malay and chris presenting

103
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,959
then we're going to start i'm going to

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,799
have enough minutes for you to have

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
clarifications about the details

106
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,400
of uh this use cases

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,599
before moving on to the open discussion

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,480
uh

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,320
for this topic then we're gonna talk

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
about what is the interest of the group

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
and what potential next steps we may or

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440
may not want to

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,759
take so

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
do you have any questions about the

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
agenda so far

116
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,360
okay so can we move to the next slide

117
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,359
please

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,679
so the purpose of the buff first of all

119
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,520
uh

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,440
is to inform the ietf community about

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,320
the latest mac address randomization

122
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,320
activities

123
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,560
and purposes so mac address

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
randomization as you may know it's not

125
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
necessarily something that happens

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
inside iets because it's

127
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,320
in lower layers but of course as part of

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,719
the stack it affects

129
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,400
some of the services that are provided

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,280
by protocols defined in ietf

131
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
so then we're going to present the

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,719
network and application

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,400
service related issues that are related

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
to this mac address randomization

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
activities

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,600
and uh we want to finalize uh identify

137
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,280
whether any actions are required at the

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,919
ietf

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,880
in this case actions can it's open

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,000
discussion so

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,159
it may be coordination with other seos

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
uh documentation of these use cases

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
identification

144
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,479
are of existing solutions that may be

145
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,198
there

146
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,599
or gaps that may be solved may need to

147
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,160
be solved

148
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:52,479
are there any questions about the scope

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:57,120
of the buff

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,120
okay i see no one raising hands here

151
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
so if that is the case then moving uh to

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,400
the next

153
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,039

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,599
this buff sharing so thank you carlos

176
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
and thank you

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,639
gc that's all for me

178
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,080
thanks eric for that uh clarification

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,599
yes so uh perfect moving into the the

180
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,240
next topic which is uh

181
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,479
amelia that is going to talk about uh

182
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,479
what has been done at uh ieee

183
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
and elsewhere regarding mac address

184
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
randomization

185
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:45,840
we have amelia i don't see her

186
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:45,840
on the participants

187
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,720
okay so uh eric do you want to say

188
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,520
something

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,759
otherwise we can probably present the

190
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
slides on her behalf

191
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,599
yeah i was about to say that indeed the

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,159
best thing to go forward

193
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,840
is to go through the slide hoping that

194
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,240
she will be joining

195
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,119
um gcf as far as i know you are also

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,000
quite

197
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,879
uh this is your draft first and it's

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,039
also quite

199
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,280
acupully focused and you wear as well

200
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,360
part of the activity effort so

201
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,080
maybe you are the best person to take

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
the role over

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,800
all right that's important it needs to

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,958
be done before the use case so

205
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,519
better do it yeah definitely definitely

206
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,958
thanks so uh can we move to the next

207
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,959
slide please uh carlos

208
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
so uh then uh starting with some uh

209
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,839
history here

210
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,080
uh the the whole uh work on on

211
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
privacy and mac address randomization

212
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
started after

213
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,519
uh if you remember the strength uh

214
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,279
workshop that took place uh

215
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:00,320
a long time back in the ietf

216
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,680
iab and w3c and from there

217
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
uh we there was uh some follow-up work

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,239
that

219
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,440
uh where we realized that layer two

220
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,080
identifiers

221
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
that were assigned uniquely to devices

222
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
uh

223
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,959
were uh posing a privacy threat

224
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,160
uh and then uh the work

225
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,119
uh was moved of course to ieee 802

226
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,120
where uh this uh they actually are the

227
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,279
ones defining mac addresses uh

228
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:32,959
the the at the rack in i ieee

229
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,000
and uh of course uh then uh since then

230
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,959
several projects

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
have started working on on how to solve

232
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
the issue of

233
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,160
mac address randomization we had uh

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,000
different issues where the mac address

235
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,279
randomization was something clear in

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
plain text

237
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
for instance uh when when searching for

238
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
an ssid

239
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,240
after some uh period of time actively

240
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,160
uh then possibly during the

241
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
communications and so on

242
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,160
uh there's extensive research and then

243
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,959
in the draft we have

244
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
plenty of references that show all the

245
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,319
different issues

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,160
that are show from this mac address

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,519
randomization

248
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,519
can we move to the next slide

249
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,839
then well i've already mentioned this

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
w3c iab privacy tutorial that was given

251
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,079
at

252
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,760
the ieee 802 plenary uh it's uh

253
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,519
thoroughly documented

254
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
and then that led to a number of

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,480
initiatives uh which are also

256
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
mentioned in the draft um if you

257
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,880
remember

258
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,959
around 2014 and so we we had some

259
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,640
experiments at ieee and 802 uh

260
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,800
meetings where we were randomizing mac

261
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,439
addresses and trying to see the effects

262
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
on different uh services and since then

263
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,040
now mac address randomization is a

264
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
default privacy feature in major

265
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,880
major mobile operation operating

266
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
services

267
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,040
systems can can we move to the next

268
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,040
slide please

269
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,519
then uh they work in ietf inspired on uh

270
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,360
research project

271
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,720
uh which is uh a project 802 e

272
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,160
uh this is uh the study group uh

273
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,720
in this work uh map the privacy

274
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
features so basically it was uh privacy

275
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
recommendations

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,120
for all ieee 802 protocols uh

277
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
recommended practices and considerations

278
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
that can be used

279
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,480
when defining ieee protocols

280
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,880
afterwards there was also the the 802

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:38,959
c slot that assigns

282
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,519
dynamic addresses to devices

283
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
upon need and this is made for

284
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,120
industrial

285
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,120
sensors and so on next slide please

286
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,160
there was also the ieee 2

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,160
11aq amendment which introduced robust

288
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,439
recommendations for mac address

289
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,560
randomization

290
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,240
and now uh just this at this time it's

291
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,760
happening in ieee

292
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,480
802 11 there are two pars

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,160
project authorization requests uh 8011

294
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
bh and bi

295
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,519
that are going to look at privacy

296
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,000
features and network operation

297
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
in absence of a clear test permanent

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
layer 2

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,360
identifiers so very relevant to

300
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
to this work uh this these two are uh

301
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
just

302
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,120
starting now so uh is a

303
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,760
perfect time basically to start talking

304
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,440
about this uh

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,959
topics in in like ietf as well

306
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
can we move to the next slide please

307
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,480
then we have a wba that is also relying

308
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
on a higher layer identity management

309
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
which is kind of an extension of the

310
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,000
past point in wi-fi alliance

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,319
and that they ring the bell for

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,279
people that are familiar with that rom

313
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,200
architecture

314
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
so the idea there is also to make sure

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,680
that there are ways to to authenticate

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,880
users and allow them to connect

317
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,040
to wi-fi networks more

318
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,839
freely in different domains

319
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,839
next slide please

320
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,600
this table shows just a summary of

321
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,720
some operating systems and some of the

322
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,399
features that

323
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,760
uh already use mac address randomization

324
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,240
uh as you know there's uh android

325
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,000
ios and windows already using mac

326
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,959
address randomization

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
and well you have there the details uh

328
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,199
basically

329
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,000
uh operating systems today use

330
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,680
uh dynamic mac addresses or or

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
randomized mac addresses to connect to

332
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,239
networks

333
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,240
but they don't do it in a in a standard

334
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
way there's different ways to to do it

335
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,760
depending on the operating system

336
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,199
and i'm not going to talk about the

337
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,079
details because then

338
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,719
uh we're going to have uh more uh later

339
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,800
on by

340
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
uh dave taylor who's going to explain

341
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,959
how this works in windows

342
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,000
and and we are going to hear in the use

343
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,839
cases

344
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
but if ever you want to have more

345
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
details there's there's a reference

346
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,000
there

347
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,240
next slide so

348
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
uh comments and questions as i mentioned

349
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,800
uh what we would like to take after

350
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
uh we finish with the presentation of

351
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,319
this mac address randomization uh

352
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,560
background history

353
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
and the presentation from dave so if you

354
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,319
don't mind

355
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,199
let's move now to dave's presentation

356
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
and we will take

357
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,079
comments and questions for both uh right

358
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,079
after

359
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,839
all right testing audio can you guys

360
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
hear me okay

361
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
juan carlos can you hear me

362
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,959
yeah you're good okay great just thanks

363
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,680
for racking

364
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,279
all right so uh as juan carlos mentioned

365
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,160
i'm going to talk about what we did in

366
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,000
windows 10

367
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
at least i don't know five years ago or

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
so uh and you'll see a lot of it

369
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,079
overlaps with

370
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,800
uh what one carlos showed for um ios

371
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,680
and android but i guess we wanted to

372
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,760
have at least one

373
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,120
drill down into examples and a lot of

374
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
these will be common across operating

375
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
systems

376
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
next slide please

377
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,599
all right so i'm not going to talk much

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,079
about this one other than

379
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,480
um things are configurable which i'll

380
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,279
get into in a moment here um

381
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,880
it does depend on support being in

382
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,360
hardware and drivers

383
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,079
and so it's almost always present but if

384
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
you have

385
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,638
an odd uh hardware or old driver or

386
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,800
something like that you might not see it

387
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,959
but otherwise there's configurations on

388
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,279
a global base in other words on a per

389
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,638
wi-fi interface basis and per network so

390
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,800
next slide i'll get into the details

391
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,800
here

392
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,000
okay so there's two types of settings

393
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,719
like global we mean

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
um no matter where you are on your wi-fi

395
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,680
interface as your roam around global

396
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,399
just means as i roam around anywhere on

397
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,399
the globe

398
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
um that's what the global setting is and

399
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,839
so there's a setting

400
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
that applies to scans for nearby

401
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,959
networks right and so

402
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,120
uh in case you're new to the problem

403
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,758
space one of the problems is this just

404
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,920
when you scan for wi-fi networks the

405
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,040
probes go out and the probes come from a

406
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,319
mac address

407
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,240
that uh is like an identifier and so in

408
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,880
various public locations they

409
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,079
monitor the mac addresses of the probe

410
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,199
so even though you're not connected to

411
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,638
any ssid

412
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,240
you're still broadcasting a unique

413
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,839
identifier and so

414
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,920
what the global setting does is it

415
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
applies first of all to these probes

416
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,479
that say when i'm not connected to any

417
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,399
ssid

418
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
right all the probes are coming from a

419
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,959
random mac address

420
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,719
and every time you connect or disconnect

421
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,518
from any network or you restart the

422
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,759
device

423
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,120
that random thing changes okay so this

424
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
is the main

425
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,959
tracking danger now of course this is

426
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,319
only one of the pieces of it but this is

427
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,599
probably the most popular way of

428
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
tracking people because you can track

429
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,440
that even when they're not connected to

430
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,319
your network

431
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
okay second part of the settings has to

432
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
do with what happens when you do connect

433
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,079
to an ssid

434
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,359
okay and so when you connect to that

435
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,639
ssid

436
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,319
then by default the same address is used

437
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,919
so if you disconnect you reconnect you

438
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,280
disconnect you reconnect

439
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
each time that you connect to that

440
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,079
particular ssid you'll get the same mac

441
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,079
address right this is the default and of

442
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,839
course you can forget the network and

443
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,280
sort of clear that state but once you

444
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,480
connect to something it creates a piece

445
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
of state that says what

446
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,880
mac address i'm going for that network

447
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,600
okay now the reason for this is keep

448
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
keeping use the same one over time and

449
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,678
as

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,039
you'll see on the very bottom here

451
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
there's uh

452
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,879
three different um uh behaviors i've

453
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,439
been default one

454
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,039
um and so the the main reason for this

455
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,919
is a trade-off between

456
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,679
privacy and usability right now there's

457
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,280
a number of places you know hotels and

458
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
hot spots and things that make you fill

459
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
out a

460
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,760
form when you first connect or even

461
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,120
charge you when you first connect right

462
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
and if you were to change the mac

463
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,439
address every time you connected to that

464
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,039
network

465
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
you'd at least have to fill out a form

466
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,559
if not pay every single time

467
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,400
that you change your mac address right

468
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,799
and so that's the usability aspect that

469
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,640
users don't want that and so instead

470
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,639
the very first time it will generate a

471
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
random one and subsequent ones will

472
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,760
reuse the same ones the first

473
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
time so that you won't have to re-go

474
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
through that form or paying or whatever

475
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,280
so that's kind of the middle ground

476
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,039
category

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,480
okay now any existing connection so if

478
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,000
you change the behavior

479
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,000
which you've already connected to you

480
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,679
know at office or at home or whatever

481
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
it will continue using the one in other

482
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,280
words once you join an ssid it's

483
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,760
remembered even if it was the physical

484
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
one

485
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
it's remember that with that ssid until

486
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,760
you change until you

487
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,679
forget that ssid okay so that's the

488
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,080
global setting

489
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,520
by by global i mean again not ssid

490
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
specific

491
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,679
i mentioned that once you connect to an

492
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,678
ssid right it remembers the state for

493
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,120
that ssid right what's the mac address

494
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
that i'm going to use that ssid says

495
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
settings that you can store

496
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,960
in that ssid specific state okay there's

497
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,840
actually three different settings that

498
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,919
can be used

499
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,360
and this is configurable by users or

500
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
admins

501
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,479
the first one is to say off which says

502
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,000
use the permanent hardware mac address

503
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,400
okay means don't use

504
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
mac randomization and an example of

505
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,679
networks where that's important is let's

506
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
say you have a corporate network that's

507
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,320
using the physical mac address for

508
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
inventory tracking

509
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,200
right and so they won't let you on the

510
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
network unless you're letting your

511
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,160
network getting on the network with the

512
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,879
hardware mac address that they've

513
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
inventoried

514
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,360
okay that would be an example of where

515
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,320
that's kind of necessary

516
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,918
on such networks the second option is

517
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,720
equivalent to the default one

518
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
which is um use the random mac address

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,559
the first time that you connect

520
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,080
i've noticed use the same one and it's

521
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
random when i first connect and then you

522
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,120
store it there and you reconnect with

523
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
the same one right that's the default

524
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,199
option

525
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,360
when you're using mac address

526
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,360
randomization but then if you have a

527
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,280
case let's say you go to a uh

528
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,399
internet cafe or a coffee house or

529
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,799
something every day

530
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
right you might say well maybe i don't

531
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
like the fact

532
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,360
that they can tell that it's me every

533
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
single time i appear there on this

534
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,559
public network

535
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
that's what the change daily is for it

536
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,720
says every

537
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,399
time that i connect if i'm connecting on

538
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,600
the same day as i last

539
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
stored as i stored the mac address then

540
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,080
keep

541
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
using it but if it's a new day

542
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
regenerate a new one okay

543
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,840
and so that way i don't have to refill

544
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,199
out a form or pay or whatever if i'm

545
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,320
connecting back the same day but the

546
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,159
next day i will

547
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,360
okay and so that one's meant for cases

548
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
where you're really worried about you

549
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,320
know hot spots or something tracking you

550
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
that you visit daily

551
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,439
and so the point is all three are

552
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,200
configurable options

553
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
and there each one is appropriate on a

554
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,799
different category of network

555
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
and since there's no clean way to know

556
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,480
what the network's intent

557
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,960
is then we ask the user but it's also

558
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,480
configurable on an admin basis

559
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,080
next slide last slide

560
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:54,880
okay um now specifics

561
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,918
the mac address is a hash of a secret

562
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
the ssid

563
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,080
right you saw in that table that juan

564
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,080
carlos showed that android and ios

565
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,199
differ by whether it changes by ssid or

566
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,559
bssid

567
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,559
right windows is the ssid uh and

568
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,600
the mac address uses a cryptographically

569
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,440
random api

570
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,120
and so it really is cryptographically

571
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
random but of course since it's

572
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,320
generating mac addresses it makes sure

573
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
that the bits are set in the

574
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,360
high bit to say that it's locally

575
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,918
administered and it's a unicast address

576
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,199
so far even though it was in there since

577
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,559
at least five years ago

578
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
it's not enabled by default and that's

579
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,039
because there's still

580
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,480
reports that there are some networks and

581
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,720
no i don't have numbers

582
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
uh i wish i did uh maybe somebody does

583
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,080
but i don't have uh numbers on there's

584
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,520
still some networks that have problems

585
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,918
when you have randomization

586
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,600
if you try to turn it on some networks

587
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,000
with mac address filtering or hotspots

588
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,520
may have

589
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
problems and so that's why it's not on

590
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,120
by default we would love to turn it on

591
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,199
by default uh we're just not there yet

592
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,320
but we hope to get there

593
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
once the numbers allow so the times that

594
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
it's

595
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,400
most likely on is where there's clueful

596
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,158
users like people sitting in this

597
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,200
audience that turn it on

598
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,280
or more likely when there's an it

599
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,960
manager that turns it on for all devices

600
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,639
so if you have corporate laptops and

601
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
things that get the roam around

602
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,520
those are the ones that most likely have

603
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,320
it on because the it managers will turn

604
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,200
it on

605
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,799
um with any of those settings and so um

606
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,520
that's the brief overview happy to take

607
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,760
questions

608
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,799
uh christian wiedema five years ago when

609
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,879
we first did it

610
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
or shortly after it was done uh wrote

611
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,640
this blog article that has a slightly

612
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,840
longer explanation but i've now pretty

613
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,360
much told you all the highlights that's

614
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,320
in that article so

615
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,840
uh and uh the slides here is still um

616
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,439
accurate to what's shipping in windows

617
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,039
10 right now

618
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
so there you go that's my last slide

619
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,120
happy to take questions but otherwise uh

620
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,320
back to you um carlos and covers

621
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,100
thanks a lot dave uh so uh eric uh

622
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,399
you're on the queue uh

623
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,360
[Music]

624
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:59,120
okay no probably uh

625
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,120
right so we see daniel

626
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,960
uh hi there thanks for this presentation

627
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,600
um

628
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,400
in the the list of specifics here you

629
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,719
mentioned the

630
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
the address calculation is a hash of

631
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
secret ssid and connection id and i'm

632
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,039
sorry if i missed this

633
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,639
it's pretty early for me um is that a

634
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,158
stable secret across the lifetime of the

635
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,360
machine or a new secret every time

636
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
uh i am not the best person to ask that

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,120
question

638
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,600
um but my understanding is every time

639
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,959
that it

640
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,520
generates a new mac address it uses all

641
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,320
the entropy provided by the crypto api

642
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,679
and so uh in other words my belief is

643
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,240
that the entropy isn't a one-time

644
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,600
entropy

645
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
that it's each time but i don't know

646
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,879
that for sure i can follow up and get

647
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,320
you an answer if you need it

648
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,000
that would be great because i mean if

649
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
it's if it's new

650
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
new entropy every time it's not clear to

651
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,799
me why you would need

652
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,760
to do this hashing even um like what the

653
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,559
point of the hashing is

654
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,520
you could just apply the the entropy

655
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,879
directly yeah

656
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,720
you're right it could be that it's the

657
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
same secret that's generated at machine

658
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,880
install time that's possible

659
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
i'd have to check i didn't implement

660
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,440
this myself i'm just reporting out on it

661
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,919
so sorry i don't know the answer to your

662
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,600
question

663
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,600
but i get your point yeah you're right

664
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:21,440
um yes sorry was there somebody else

665
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
yeah we have glenn okay

666
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,080
uh thanks can you hear me okay

667
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,240
yep yes yeah this is a glenn parsons

668
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,399
uh from erickson uh so i just had a

669
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,840
comment on the 802 um

670
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,880
aspects uh i just wanted to mention um

671
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,918
one particular uh ongoing activity that

672
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,600
wasn't mentioned

673
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,640
um which is called uh the 802.1

674
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,279
aedk activity this uh the title of this

675
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,679
is mac

676
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,120
privacy protection so this is an

677
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,960
amendment to the

678
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,559
max security standard in 802.1

679
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,480
and it's specifically defining an

680
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,520
encapsulation format

681
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,320
um that can uh carry

682
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,000
uh confidential protected data within a

683
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,360
frame and so it would hide the

684
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
the original user's mac address as well

685
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,760
as the frame sizes and so the frames

686
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,799
would be padded to some

687
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,799
consistent or random size as well

688
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,440
to protect the privacy so this is a

689
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,039
project mac privacy protection

690
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,840
that's currently underway as well i just

691
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,840
wanted to note that

692
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,679
great thanks a lot for that

693
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,600
uh stephen hi dave

694
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,760
just a question about the default on

695
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
can you say anything about the kind of

696
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,720
factors you would consider

697
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,918
before going to defaults on for this i i

698
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
guess you can't commit to anything or

699
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,640
give specifics but

700
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,000
just a guidance what kind of things

701
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,679
would you be expecting before

702
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,760
turning it on as a default uh sure

703
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,760
uh can we go back one slide carlos

704
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,679
um okay so i'm gonna look at if you look

705
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,240
at like the three options down at the

706
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,159
bottom

707
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
i said each of these would be applicable

708
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,000
to a different type of

709
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,360
network right so the first one was an

710
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,559
example of that would be a corporate

711
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
network that uses

712
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,039
mac addresses for inventory management

713
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,039
right and so you could say well

714
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
on would break that but you can also say

715
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,200
if i'm using it for inventory management

716
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,639
then uh maybe that's a case where it's

717
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
it managed anyway

718
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,799
and so this that you could have a the it

719
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,479
administrator would send out off in that

720
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,639
particular case and say

721
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,720
so that one is not that big of a deal

722
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,120
unless you start having things like

723
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,760
inventory management on things that are

724
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,158
not

725
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
uh managed and so if you have a byod

726
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,360
device meaning you have your own

727
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,439
laptop and you bring it in to work or

728
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
whatever and it only works if you've

729
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,679
registered the hardware mac address

730
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,120
ahead of time

731
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
then that would have problems there and

732
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,439
so i'm just saying what are the gaps or

733
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,679
things that you need

734
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
solutions to address even if they're

735
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,799
social workarounds or tooling

736
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,880
workarounds right

737
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
um second type of network is the ones

738
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,600
for on would be there

739
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,840
right which is kind of where we want to

740
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,320
get to was the default right and so

741
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,320
um they're the only issues that i know

742
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,000
of are the ones that were hinted at

743
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,360
on the next slide which is if you have

744
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
some public hotspot

745
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,918
or things so an example would be if

746
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,120
there exists hardware out there

747
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,279
that doesn't work right if the mac

748
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,879
address that you use in the probe

749
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,960
is different from the mac address that

750
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,039
you use after connecting right so

751
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,799
if for some reason they've made it only

752
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,320
work when those two things are equal

753
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,879
then of course on would have a problem

754
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,960
and once that set of hardware if the

755
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,640
problems like that once they go away

756
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,279
because what happens when

757
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,039
uh you say if you change the default or

758
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,720
if you upgrade you buy

759
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,760
you upgrade an operating system to a

760
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,760
newer version it has a different

761
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,760
behavior if you change that behavior

762
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
people think that the operating system

763
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,080
must be broken because it no longer

764
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
connection it used to

765
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,520
right and so how do you prevent those

766
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,720
regressions for cases that it was

767
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,200
working before

768
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
um now at least once you've connected to

769
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,840
something we

770
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,679
store the mac address that you're using

771
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,959
right so hopefully on an upgrade

772
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,640
that you've remembered the fact that

773
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
you're using the physical one which it

774
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,559
does

775
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,158
and so if you were using the physical

776
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,840
one before then you'll continue using

777
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,360
the physical one until you change the

778
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,480
network setting or until you forget the

779
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,840
network

780
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
and then lastly uh change daily um if

781
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,279
you're thinking about you know the you

782
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,479
know the starbucks style networks you

783
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,679
might be worried about people tracking

784
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,159
you i think it's really the

785
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
same uh thing and so i guess that's my

786
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,559
long answer but hopefully that's enough

787
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,559
to answer your questions here

788
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,480
so it's really once there's existing

789
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,760
tools once

790
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,840
the the observed deployments of

791
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,840
problematic networks becomes negligible

792
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,360
you know and the the statistics might be

793
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,039
different for something like mobile os's

794
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,479
uh only because the types of networks

795
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
that you connect to might be skewed

796
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,679
compared to what say you know a laptop

797
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,320
connects to you right they'd be close

798
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,840
but they wouldn't be

799
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,840
exactly the same sample set so

800
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,039
okay thank you very much

801
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,200
uh are there any more

802
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,158
uh clarification questions for this

803
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,960
first part

804
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,960
oh yeah see then yep done

805
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,360
would you like to okay yeah

806
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
okay great thank you uh thanks for the

807
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,520
presentation dave

808
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,799
uh so does windows 10 do the other

809
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,799
uh things that were specified in 8211 aq

810
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,760
when you randomize a mac address

811
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,039
namely uh reset the uh the sequence not

812
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,120
the packet sequence number

813
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,760
and and reseed the ofdm scrambler

814
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,639
i don't know the answer to that offhand

815
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,840
my belief

816
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,520
is that um we change all the things that

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,399
you'd want to change at the same time

818
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,158
right

819
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,158
now you actually about very specifics

820
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,039
that i don't know the answer to since

821
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,440
i'm not one of the

822
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,559
lenders on this particular team uh but i

823
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,080
work with them so i don't know the

824
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,520
answer offhand but i know we do things

825
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,559
like when you change the mac address you

826
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,799
want to change the

827
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,918
ipv6 address even though the ipv6

828
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,440
address is not derived from the mac

829
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,640
address right so you change the things

830
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,559
that could be correlated

831
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,159
all at the same time rather than at

832
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,600
different times which would allow you to

833
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,159
introduce correlations between them and

834
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,199
so my belief is yes but i can't

835
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,120
authoritatively say that yeah and for

836
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
things that are not really layer two but

837
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,719
sort of like two and a half like the

838
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,600
the dhcp client id is that do you

839
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,360
change that as well um those are all

840
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,918
great questions i don't know the answer

841
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,799
offhand

842
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,320
but my since um christian used to be the

843
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,600
person that was driving this and which

844
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,279
is why he wrote the blog on

845
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,600
uh five years ago he could probably tell

846
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,480
you off the top of his head my belief is

847
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,519
that windows

848
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,360
has spent a lot of time on the privacy

849
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,720
aspects over the last five years and

850
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
knowing what to change that when you

851
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,440
turn it on

852
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,120
that is trying to do the right thing

853
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,600
with all the different identifiers so

854
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,439
gosh i hope so if not then we'll fix it

855
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,580
but i i hope so

856
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,799
okay thank you

857
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,439
[Music]

858
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,120
i then uh we're going to move to the

859
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,720
next on the queue and we're going to

860
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,000
cut the queue with michael

861
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,919
so next yes dear

862
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,200
hey hey hey dave thanks for the

863
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,960
presentation i mean uh

864
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,360
i had a few clarifications how do you

865
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,720
make it easy for an user to

866
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,559
for example enable this randomization in

867
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,880
untrusted networks like coffee shops

868
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,158
airports and then enable this interested

869
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,399
networks for example

870
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:48,240
i have i enable home network security

871
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,120
and i want my home network security

872
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,600
service to

873
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,279
enforce policies per device uh just to

874
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,519
identify anomalous behavior

875
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,679
and various such activities right so how

876
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,600
does the how does the nav user right i

877
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,360
mean uh would enable these options or

878
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,719
disable these options on a per network

879
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,039
basis

880
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,399
yeah that's a good question um if you uh

881
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,080
were to go into

882
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,239
christian's blog which is uh linked on

883
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,639
the last one um that actually walks

884
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,960
through

885
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,000
uh the specific ui where you can find it

886
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,679
yeah if you would look in there

887
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,200
because there's screens screenshots and

888
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,080
stuff in there so that will answer your

889
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,720
question but um

890
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,320
is it easy well it's more for an

891
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,080
advanced user if you because it doesn't

892
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,080
say hey would you like to be private on

893
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,600
this particular network right there's a

894
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,639
button you can connect you can click on

895
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,439
that will actually take you to the

896
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,600
settings

897
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
uh that that you can change it and so is

898
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,439
it is it

899
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,120
easily discoverable well it's not hidden

900
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,240
but it's not in your face right and so

901
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,959
it could be better

902
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,399
um but it is there when you uh connect

903
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,840
or when you look at the settings for any

904
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,399
particular ssid

905
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,678
you can find those three settings uh in

906
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,399
the you know wi-fi settings for that

907
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,440
ssid

908
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,279
so it's not hidden but it's not great

909
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,039
could be could be more discoverable but

910
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,559
it's not you know

911
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,600
there's a natural path to click on to

912
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,879
get there and again you'll find the

913
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,959
details you'll find the walk through in

914
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,360
the actual blog there

915
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,360
thanks dude

916
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,320
michael dave um when you're

917
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,399
uh windows 10 doing uh wpa enterprise or

918
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,918
802.1x or whatever you want to call it

919
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:22,320
um are you using the same mac address

920
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,120
um as you would to connect and how do

921
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,639
you know

922
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,439
what network you're really connecting it

923
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
to at that point

924
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,039
um i'm not going to be able to answer

925
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,919
your question authoritatively again

926
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,960
because now you're asking a very

927
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,320
detailed question and

928
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,159
not being the implementer i don't know

929
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,918
for sure and i can tell you you're not

930
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,440
going to find that particular answer in

931
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,880
the ones that i don't know the answers

932
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,799
are also not in christian's blog either

933
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,080
which means i actually have to ask the

934
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,519
the devs who couldn't make this

935
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,279
particular meeting so i'm presenting

936
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:53,600
their slides on our behalf but um

937
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:56,399
thank you uh so i don't know

938
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
okay well thank you very much uh for

939
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,320
that uh

940
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,918
dave so we're gonna stop here uh for the

941
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,918
first part of the buff and we're gonna

942
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,799
move to the to the next one which is the

943
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,240
the use cases and just as a reminder

944
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,599
again we're going to go through the use

945
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,799
cases then we're going to take

946
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,800
clarification questions on the use cases

947
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
uh before moving on to the open

948
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,440
discussion

949
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,480
so now we're going to have jason chris

950
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,240
and malay

951
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,240
present the use cases

952
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,399
all right great so this my name is jason

953
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,280
weil with

954
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,560
uh charter communications um what we did

955
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
is we took

956
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,239
we started this project we uh got

957
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,279
together a number of isps

958
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,479
uh to come up with use cases um we

959
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,040
actually ended up with like a dozen or

960
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,599
so

961
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,000
that we uh tried to win you down to a

962
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,280
few high-level ones so that it wouldn't

963
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
we wouldn't spend the whole time talking

964
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,760
about use cases on this uh off

965
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,760
uh so i'm gonna cover some of the isp

966
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,599
use cases and then hand it off to

967
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,760
uh malay and then we'll follow up with

968
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,040
uh but chris at the end to get an

969
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,960
overview

970
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,960
um okay first one our second slide

971
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,680
all right so yeah so the first use case

972
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
is access control uh based on mac

973
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,720
address

974
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,720
this is pretty common across most isps i

975
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,839
know charter does it and

976
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,799
many other isps that do it as well

977
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
uh so for this use case you know cpus

978
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,040
are

979
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,118
or we uh we create uh

980
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,400
we use the mac address as a as an

981
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
identifier for

982
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,400
uh devices on the network uh and then we

983
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
use that as a

984
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,920
access control for that network offering

985
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,359
things such as

986
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,640
you know pause um uh given device

987
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,839
nicknames things like that

988
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,200
and then we also do it's also used for

989
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,400
uh dos mitigations uh and some networks

990
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
for filters putting filters onto uh cpu

991
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,359
devices

992
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,960
and and obviously what i'm talking when

993
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,560
i talk about cp devices i'm talking

994
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,440
about the home gateway routers that we

995
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,119
deploy

996
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,400
in home networks um and then part a lot

997
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,440
of this falls underneath the frontal

998
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,240
control

999
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,240
as a service

1000
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,240
okay next slide

1001
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,200
another use case is setting up a using

1002
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,000
dhcp to set up a sticky ip address for

1003
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,839
services

1004
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,079
uh such as a static port forwarding

1005
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,520
or setting up the dmz a lot of this ties

1006
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,200
to ipv4 addresses

1007
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,960
uh more so than ipv6 addresses

1008
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,640
uh but it's common for you know if you

1009
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,079
want to rdp into a device in your home

1010
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,078
or if you want to if you have a child

1011
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,800
that hosts a minecraft server

1012
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,160
uh this is a good example of doing that

1013
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,440
um

1014
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,720
using a the uh dsp server to tie an ik

1015
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,480
address and port forward

1016
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:55,118
to uh to a to a mac address

1017
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,320
all right next line

1018
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,440
so uh this is more of a use case of of

1019
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,800
a impact to

1020
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,720
uh to mac address rotation and a lot of

1021
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,760
it depends on how often the

1022
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,959
the mac address is rotated um

1023
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,800
but some uh some dhcp pools are fairly

1024
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,119
small on some devices

1025
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,280
and so if the if every time you change

1026
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,520
the mac address if it results in a

1027
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,160
new ip address and then the old ip

1028
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,759
address is still stuck in the dhp pool

1029
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,520
uh depending how many devices you have

1030
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
on the network uh

1031
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,520
over time you could run out the uh the

1032
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
ip address pool and the new devices

1033
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,359
uh would not be able to come onto the

1034
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
network

1035
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,800
uh all right go ahead next next slide

1036
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,079
uh so there's a whole slew of use cases

1037
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,839
that fall underneath this i consider

1038
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,960
like diagnostics along with network

1039
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:56,799
management so this is how isps

1040
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,760
help troubleshoot uh customer

1041
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,320
connections um

1042
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,920
a lot of times you'll you will use the

1043
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,400
the the mac address is an

1044
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,480
identifier for a device uh to help

1045
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,000
either try to figure out how much

1046
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,040
uh usage it's doing or uh if it's

1047
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,839
causing problems

1048
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,880
um you know it possibly has malware how

1049
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,040
do we track that

1050
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,520
uh coming from that device um

1051
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,200
so there's definitely a need here well

1052
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,640
there's argument for a need here for

1053
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,118
a persistent identifier uh to help

1054
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,160
help with doing this there's also so

1055
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,440
typically the

1056
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,480
the mac addresses um per ssid is is fine

1057
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,599
in this case

1058
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,560
but there is a use case uh where if you

1059
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,079
move the device

1060
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,920
um say if it's on wi-fi um

1061
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,160
as well as a mobile device on the same

1062
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,680
network uh trying to track that device

1063
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,440
across multiple networks

1064
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,720
there is an argument or there is a use

1065
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,520
case there where

1066
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
you need to go beyond just the per ssid

1067
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,880
if you want to make that

1068
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,880
that use case valid um

1069
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,599
performance

1070
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,960
um yeah that's good um look at the next

1071
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,320
slide i can ask i'm sure there's lots of

1072
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,839
questions that might come out of this so

1073
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,839
feel free to ask away

1074
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,560
all right um so this is the it's kind of

1075
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,040
like a follow-up to

1076
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,440
uh the printer control slash uh using

1077
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,720
the mac address as an identifier

1078
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,599
for advanced uh in-home features uh like

1079
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,598
we use this

1080
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,640
today for like i was saying before like

1081
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,680
pausing networks

1082
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,000
uh schedule pause grouping the grouping

1083
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,720
uh

1084
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,160
devices say all the kids all the devices

1085
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,680
that belong to a

1086
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,759
uh one of your children you might want

1087
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,839
to put in a group and disable those

1088
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,599
uh at a certain time each day uh when

1089
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,040
it's time to go to sleep

1090
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,680
um there's more advanced things you

1091
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,599
could do as well uh things like

1092
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,040
uh speed boost for certain devices

1093
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,040
they're you know that you need to know

1094
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,160
the device's id

1095
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,320
um and then uh

1096
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,200
we call printo controls like i discussed

1097
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,319
as well so

1098
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,598
if you if you want to block content uh

1099
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,440
you can a lot of some systems use

1100
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,200
that are deployed today use the mac

1101
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,640
address as the identifier

1102
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,040
and then more advanced uh uh terminal

1103
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,240
well

1104
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,920
more advanced features to figure out uh

1105
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,799
where that that device is going and then

1106
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,319
create like a white list or blacklist to

1107
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,319
block that type of content

1108
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,720
um okay i think that covers most of the

1109
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,960
isp

1110
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,319
in-home use cases i'll hand this over to

1111
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,839
malay for the

1112
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,839
for the next portion

1113
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,520
malay from bloom uh so a lot of

1114
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:54,560
home network management use cases

1115
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,200
are also uh go

1116
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
in line with the isp use cases like the

1117
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,480
previous slide which was mentioned

1118
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,839
and while doing the uh while you know

1119
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,160
providing such features you know we

1120
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:08,000
managed

1121
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:21,839
devices from the cloud so that means

1122
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:21,839
that we

1123
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:51,040
and we we can't really

1124
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,599
uh we can't really uh discard

1125
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,040
the devices which have randomized mac

1126
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,680
addresses because you know there is a

1127
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,160
chance that

1128
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,560
user would like to add them to a

1129
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,598
particular person profile like you know

1130
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,078
if the mac address is fixed by

1131
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,200
when associating to the ssid so that

1132
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,040
means that

1133
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,640
uh if the mac address was changing

1134
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:18,640
after associating then the database

1135
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:22,560
across the entire network increases uh

1136
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,040
rapidly and that would have detrimental

1137
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,839
effect

1138
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,240
on the management of the database and

1139
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,599
then

1140
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,680
also uh you know the the clustering of

1141
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,680
the cloud devices which are

1142
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,078
referring to that device uh that

1143
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,598
database will also be affected so

1144
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,680
all of the management complexity

1145
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:45,839
increases by then

1146
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,839
next site

1147
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,079
uh so mac randomizing mac address would

1148
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,359
you know

1149
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,480
lead to uh the uh

1150
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,400
sign in to that public wi-fi each time

1151
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,599
uh even if the device is in the same

1152
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,319
area

1153
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,319
next slide please

1154
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,000
uh this this goes about this

1155
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,078
specific feature is about the roaming of

1156
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,200
uh the device across the public wi-fi

1157
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,400
networks

1158
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,279
say i have a specific network

1159
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,760
uh cell phone plan which you know lets

1160
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,359
me

1161
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:13,359
auto roam to that cell phone

1162
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:16,400
network providers wi-fi networks

1163
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,839
then if i'm walking around in a

1164
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,880
community

1165
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,920
then my mac address would be used

1166
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,040
to efficiently roam between

1167
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:30,160
the networks but if my mac address is

1168
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:34,079
randomized per bssid then

1169
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,078
each time i am walking to the next home

1170
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,079
which is providing uh the community

1171
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,839
wi-fi then i would have to go through

1172
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,359
the process

1173
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,920
the network would have to go through the

1174
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,720
process of creating a new tunnel

1175
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,960
and that would be also be detrimental to

1176
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,200
the experience which i would be having

1177
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,359
see if i'm doing streaming then i would

1178
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,799
i would see effects

1179
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:00,480
on on the internet experience on

1180
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:05,839
just by roaming around walking around

1181
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,839
a particular location next slide please

1182
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,480
experience quality of experience for

1183
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,839
that particular device

1184
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,839
and it happens

1185
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,400
uh for for the

1186
00:45:45,520 --> 00:46:01,839
data and then measurement of qoe

1187
00:45:49,359 --> 00:46:01,839
would happen and then would be verified

1188
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,440
okay uh i think uh chris can take over

1189
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,119
now thank you

1190
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,400
yeah uh hopefully you can hear me um

1191
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:30,160
so when you have an access point with

1192
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,319
multiple frequency bands um

1193
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
currently well the the old way of doing

1194
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:36,240
things is

1195
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,078
the client always chooses which

1196
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,000
brand to connect to and which access

1197
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,200
point to connect you which means you can

1198
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,960
end up with

1199
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,078
crowding of multiple devices on one

1200
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,720
band but the other not really being used

1201
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,200
so in order to remedy that situation

1202
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,879
there's something called client steering

1203
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,200
now the new wi-fi standard has

1204
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,280
something called multiband steering

1205
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,919
which does this in a fairly decent way

1206
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,560
so it's

1207
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,000
it's take it's asking clients for

1208
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,920
measurements of the signal strength of

1209
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,160
the different bands

1210
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,240
and then advising them yeah which is the

1211
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,359
best for them to use

1212
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,759
but uh for all the devices you know

1213
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,040
uh there has been a legacy mechanism

1214
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,640
that's used which is

1215
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,240
um this is something that's only

1216
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,480
implemented at the

1217
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,240
access point end so it's it's really the

1218
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
access point looking at the signal

1219
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:33,839
strength that it sees from the clients

1220
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:36,400
and then if it wants them to move it's

1221
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,000
essentially saying go away go away and

1222
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,119
hoping that they reconnect on the other

1223
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,880
one so

1224
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,400
if you've got that kind of older client

1225
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,160
access points may then have to compare

1226
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,240
the signal strength they see

1227
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,920
on a probe request on one band with the

1228
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,879
single strength they see for data

1229
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,000
traffic

1230
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,559
of that same station on other band now

1231
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,400
if those

1232
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,400
two use different mac addresses then

1233
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,240
the access point can't then determine

1234
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,040
that the probe request is from the same

1235
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,558
device and

1236
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,279
be unable to perform that client

1237
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,280
steering action

1238
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,160
the other complication here is the

1239
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,240
access points also need to record

1240
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,558
which clients do not respond well to the

1241
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,040
legacy steering attempts

1242
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,839
because essentially if if you're just

1243
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
saying

1244
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
go away go away you know some clients

1245
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
will

1246
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,880
will take the hint and will will

1247
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,079
reconnect elsewhere but others will not

1248
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,240
they'll just

1249
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,520
keep trying and so the extra point need

1250
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,160
to track

1251
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,839
which clients do that um and essentially

1252
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,680
stop saying go away

1253
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:46,839
so this requires um an identifier

1254
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,118
that is reasonably persistent so you can

1255
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,279
identify be assured that you

1256
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,720
you know it is that same device that has

1257
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,760
the problem

1258
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,520
pre-association steering may also be

1259
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,280
affected um

1260
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:03,520
because uh if client devices use

1261
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,200
a different mac address for the probe to

1262
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,960
the association then

1263
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:12,078
again you can't use that in order to

1264
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,160
influence where they connect to next

1265
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,640
slide please

1266
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,839
so that was all the use cases that we

1267
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,680
have in here

1268
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:25,119
um so in

1269
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,279
in summary when you look across those um

1270
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,400
today many services rely on that on the

1271
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,200
device mac address

1272
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,400
being that persistent identifier so the

1273
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,319
consequence of the

1274
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,040
introduction of mac randomization is

1275
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:38,880
that these services will stop working

1276
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,480
some may be fixed by tweaking the

1277
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,839
implementation

1278
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,920
but not for most of the use cases so

1279
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,359
essentially alternative identity

1280
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,520
solutions are required

1281
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,880
to enable the services to continue to

1282
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:59,440
operate while

1283
00:49:50,880 --> 00:50:03,280
also preserving reader's privacy

1284
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,480
okay thank you very much uh chris so uh

1285
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,880
we're gonna talk to you for for a second

1286
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,680
so what we're hearing is that uh these

1287
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,200
use cases

1288
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,640
are uh highlighting issues that

1289
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:19,598
people have seen on the network and uh

1290
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,558
just as a clarification the idea here is

1291
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,839
not to claim

1292
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,680
back to uh fix mac addresses again

1293
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,119
think people understand and acknowledge

1294
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,240
that the new normal

1295
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,680
is back address randomization

1296
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:38,319
trying not to abuse the term but uh

1297
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,240
but still they are highlighting uh

1298
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,960
problems that they have seen on the

1299
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,720
network

1300
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,200
related to mac address randomization

1301
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,640
that they wanted to bring forward

1302
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:50,960
so uh before moving on to uh

1303
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,000
specific ways to probably solve these

1304
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,480
problems or

1305
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,280
uh solutions that may exist there we

1306
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,160
would like to

1307
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,800
stop here and take uh just clarification

1308
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,040
questions

1309
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,319
regarding the use cases that you have

1310
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,319
been

1311
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:10,160
presented here stephen

1312
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,759
hi uh thanks i have a question for i

1313
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,680
guess malay i'm not sure which slide it

1314
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,200
is but two three back where

1315
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,759
you were saying that the mac address is

1316
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,879
stored

1317
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,000
in the cloud it wasn't clear to me what

1318
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,119
what what that's being stored for or by

1319
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,920
whom

1320
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,920
can you clarify

1321
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,599
regular case uh we are we are basically

1322
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,680
providing

1323
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,200
the features right like device policy

1324
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,640
service policies

1325
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,200
and we are having we are uh

1326
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,759
having a database right off all the uh

1327
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,839
you know

1328
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,839
device reports by

1329
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,319
sorry i forgive my ignorance i don't

1330
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,839
know i don't know who we is

1331
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,839
so pardon me

1332
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,000
okay i mean if you can if you can put a

1333
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,280
link in into the jabra chat sometime

1334
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,880
that that kind of explains i i still

1335
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,880
don't really get why

1336
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,400
and presumably all i think about is the

1337
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,559
kind of dangers of doing that so

1338
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,599
i'm not getting the the positive benefit

1339
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:47,839
of it

1340
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:47,839
so maybe we can clarify it later on

1341
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,079
you are assigning the devices and home

1342
00:52:52,720 --> 00:53:01,839
to particular profile

1343
00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:01,839
like if there are kids in home then

1344
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,839
okay thanks for caring

1345
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:54,160
uh next question uh

1346
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,118
here hello hey i have a question on same

1347
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,558
question on the cloud resource

1348
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,480
management so for example

1349
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,920
assume that there is no uh

1350
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,000
mac address randomization by the

1351
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,480
operating system but still an attacker

1352
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,480
could

1353
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,160
easily spoof mac addresses an attacker

1354
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,280
could spoof the mac address of the

1355
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,960
parent

1356
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,839
it could just simply pick a random mac

1357
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,680
address and uh and then

1358
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,119
this this entire database that you're

1359
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,839
maintaining could be dosed with

1360
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,280
uh several random mac addresses an

1361
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,960
attacker could just fight you with that

1362
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,359
right so how do you handle those i mean

1363
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,599
this is no different from how do you

1364
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,680
differentiate from a genuine os

1365
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:39,839
doing this versus an attacker doing this

1366
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:39,839
every few milliseconds

1367
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:51,920
don't hear me hey

1368
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,040
thank you okay so while we are moving a

1369
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:58,319
little bit away from

1370
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,319
the mic randomization topic here i

1371
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:09,680
have the ssid and password information

1372
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,680
correct for the home

1373
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,078
and then attacker is meaning by spoofing

1374
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,399
mac address

1375
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,440
is attacker gaining the profile

1376
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,319
information

1377
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,240
is and then gaining access to that

1378
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,880
particular network right

1379
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,640
uh there's there's no additional gain

1380
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,839
here

1381
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,440
uh for for that particular home

1382
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,440
now i'm going to say an infected device

1383
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,599
a device which is in the home

1384
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,680
that's a child's device which gets

1385
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,359
infected and it spoofs the mac address

1386
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,240
of the parent to bypass the parental

1387
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,640
control

1388
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,078
right or to bypass some other policies

1389
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,040
that you have right

1390
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,359
max seems to be a very weak identity for

1391
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,440
enforcing any such policies right i mean

1392
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:53,119
it's quite easy you just have there are

1393
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,880
several tools to

1394
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,480
spoof the mac address and you just pick

1395
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,119
your parents mac address and hey

1396
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,480
i can now make sure that the

1397
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,240
restrictions of

1398
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,000
no internet assets or the censorship

1399
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,598
policies can be easily bypassed right

1400
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,160
that's so that's a question basically

1401
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,400
any kid can do that too yeah yeah

1402
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,720
provided if parent had that enabled

1403
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,520
but you know the child child device can

1404
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,879
also

1405
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:30,079
use vpn in that case and still sure

1406
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:34,160
you wanna do this yeah

1407
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,160
okay thanks uh victor

1408
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,520
hi hopefully you can hear me um

1409
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,640
just commenting on the last item that

1410
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,880
was asked

1411
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,879
um probably perspective typically those

1412
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,559
use cases are pretty easily

1413
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,160
uh found because they manifest as out of

1414
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,000
profile behaviors

1415
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,759
so those types of devices can typically

1416
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,559
be found quite pretty quickly

1417
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,440
based on simple policies enabled in the

1418
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,559
cloud

1419
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,040
and therefore isolated as necessary so

1420
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,000
although

1421
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,440
that use case does exist um they they

1422
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,839
show us a significant

1423
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,839
pattern which can be isolated

1424
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:29,279
um elisa

1425
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:34,000
yeah thanks um juan carlos at the top

1426
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,240
you mentioned

1427
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,040
um open roaming and i was just curious

1428
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,839
if you or

1429
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,440
anybody can speak to the implications of

1430
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:42,960
this for open roaming like whether this

1431
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,520
creates difficulties or

1432
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,559
if there's a more robust uh device

1433
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,559
identity that's used

1434
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:55,040
uh well yeah i was

1435
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,640
using the slides from emilia i know i

1436
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,359
know she she had some more information

1437
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:02,799
but unfortunately i cannot speak uh

1438
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:04,400
for that uh we would like to answer that

1439
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:07,280
but maybe we'll have to take it on the

1440
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,720
on the list and ask amelia or someone

1441
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:22,000
else

1442
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:25,839
sorry okay

1443
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,359
okay so um if we have no more uh

1444
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,839
clarification questions maybe we can

1445
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:33,040
move to the to the next slide

1446
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,440
uh chris would you like to take us

1447
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,240
through

1448
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,359
uh the use case the right requirements

1449
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,959
and then

1450
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,799
we can move on to the to the open

1451
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,319
discussion

1452
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,920
sure okay so

1453
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:49,680
looking at that set of use cases um

1454
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,799
it's clear they do have different

1455
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,319
requirements on the identity

1456
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,720
which of course implies a number of

1457
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,558
different solutions may be required

1458
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,279
so in the blue table

1459
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,760
we've identified some key features to

1460
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,040
consider for each use case

1461
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,040
we're not necessarily saying what the

1462
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,200
answers are but here are some things to

1463
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,400
think about

1464
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,720
so the first one is how long of course

1465
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,359
must the identifier persist

1466
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:22,558
and for some of them that could be

1467
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,440
pretty short for others longer

1468
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:27,520
um also what level of trust is required

1469
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,359
between the client and the network

1470
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:31,280
and how confident must the network be

1471
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,078
that the client is the true owner

1472
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,640
of the identity that will vary between

1473
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,960
the cases

1474
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:43,040
then it's the same identifier required

1475
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,040
to be used pre and post association

1476
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,640
next one is is the same identifier

1477
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,200
required

1478
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,200
on a single network or multiple networks

1479
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,880
does the identifier represent the device

1480
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,200
or are we trying to represent the user

1481
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,200
here

1482
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,760
must the identifier be provided in order

1483
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:07,599
to join the network

1484
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:10,400
or is it an opt-in

1485
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,079
and finally the provisioning of any new

1486
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,520
identifier would create must be low

1487
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:17,119
friction

1488
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,119
so how could this be achieved

1489
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:25,200
so on the on the left we've got

1490
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,960
that list of cases and of course there

1491
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:30,078
is a need to

1492
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:33,119
define what identifiers

1493
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,200
could be used to meet those cases

1494
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:43,839
i don't have the answers but it's it's

1495
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:43,839
food for thought for the both

1496
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,160
right so this is basically food for

1497
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,598
thought

1498
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:55,118
and uh i guess

1499
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,160
uh well i see you

1500
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,160
do you want to say something

1501
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:05,200
i have a question for chris here so when

1502
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,440
you say identify here

1503
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,000
are you referring to the identifier at

1504
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,280
the upper application layer or you're

1505
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,480
referring

1506
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,559
to the identifier at the

1507
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,079
packet level like what similar to what

1508
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,079
map address now doing today

1509
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:26,558
so who knows what the right solution is

1510
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,558
i mean essentially what we're trying to

1511
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:32,799
do here is

1512
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:36,960
preserve makadesh address randomization

1513
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:39,599
um but uh i i suspect we tru

1514
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,319
in order to meet these use cases we will

1515
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,280
need

1516
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:45,359
some other form of identifier uh maybe

1517
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,839
multiple other forms of identifiers

1518
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:48,720
and it is the question i some of those

1519
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:53,279
could be at

1520
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:54,879
different layers so it's

1521
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:58,079
not trying to predict what the solution

1522
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,160
is um but just to say yeah

1523
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,440
some identifiers are needed they will

1524
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,640
appear at different layers

1525
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:07,839
um let's figure out

1526
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,839
what is the right layer for them

1527
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:19,039
okay um color

1528
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
so i wish i sent this to the list ahead

1529
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,760
of time but i'm wondering if we have a

1530
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,200
requirement around

1531
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,599
user input as well so for example

1532
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,558
when using 802.1x and some of the

1533
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:30,799
various forms

1534
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,240
of that one of the problems we have for

1535
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:34,240
iot devices and

1536
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,000
phones which are basically look like

1537
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,799
phones like a traditional looking voice

1538
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,640
phone

1539
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:40,400
um is that there may not be a way to

1540
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,680
enter credentials on those devices and

1541
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,520
and that becomes a problem so

1542
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,879
i think that like solving this you know

1543
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,000
trying to figure out from a requirement

1544
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,400
point of view

1545
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
um whether end user input on the device

1546
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,359
was part of this or not is used to be

1547
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,400
one of the things that constrains the

1548
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,400
solution space a little bit

1549
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:03,839
i would agree

1550
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,160
store you have a question please go

1551
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,160
ahead

1552
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,720
best point in the table provisioning uh

1553
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,720
the provisioning of any new identifier

1554
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,359
must be low friction for the user

1555
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,558
i'd actually like to question that i

1556
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:47,759
think there are

1557
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,400
use cases in which the provisioning of a

1558
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,680
new identifier should be intentionally

1559
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,119
costly for the user so that it is

1560
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,118
not trivial for users to create

1561
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:03,119
arbitrary numbers of identifiers

1562
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:04,319
that not only potentially impose a cost

1563
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,680
upon the network

1564
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:09,839
but also facilitate

1565
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,680
their for instance constantly having a

1566
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:15,279
new identity from which to

1567
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,279
to spam or or whatever

1568
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,280
yes yeah i can see that that that could

1569
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,759
be an issue

1570
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:31,280
yes so maybe it's better phrased as

1571
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:35,119
uh how consideration of

1572
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:40,559
how uh the new identity

1573
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,799
uh ought to be achieved i think we need

1574
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,680
a

1575
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,960
means of achieving low friction but

1576
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,960
ideally we should have

1577
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,960
a controllable level of friction

1578
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,839
yeah that's a good way of putting it

1579
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,960
uh yeah thanks so i just put this in the

1580
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,200
chat and

1581
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,960
was encouraged to say it out loud um and

1582
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,960
i on the slide you

1583
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,720
kind and then and what you were saying

1584
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,640
um you talk about multiple different

1585
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:22,078
identifiers but i think

1586
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:24,160
there's also some places where you just

1587
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,480
talk about the identifier and i think

1588
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,160
it's

1589
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,480
pretty clear from the discussion thus

1590
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:31,680
far that um

1591
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,319
there's like a great variety of um

1592
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,038
of uses of i will say like this

1593
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,200
information

1594
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,960
and in some cases it sounds like what is

1595
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,078
needed is a device identifier and that

1596
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,880
is historically

1597
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,839
what was had but um but for some of

1598
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,880
these cases

1599
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:48,000
uh that's really not what's needed right

1600
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,319
or you're just trying to prove that

1601
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,680
you're part of a group or um

1602
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:56,240
you know this is the same um

1603
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:57,839
uh entity that's that was presented at a

1604
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,399
previous time and these kinds of things

1605
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,720
so

1606
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,480
i think some of the considerations on

1607
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,279
the right hand side of the chart here

1608
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,119
are are good but i i i don't think

1609
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,440
anyone should assume that like a single

1610
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,440
identifier is uh

1611
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,960
this is like even the proper place to

1612
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,319
start for the

1613
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,000
the solution discussion um

1614
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,440
because it sounds like there's a sort of

1615
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,520
a whole um

1616
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,559
api surface almost that that you could

1617
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,000
imagine having

1618
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,599
that would serve lots of these different

1619
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,599
use cases um but

1620
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:33,839
likely reveal different information to

1621
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:33,839
different parties depending on the use

1622
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,400
the aim here is not to say that there um

1623
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,319
should be a single identifier that

1624
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:45,440
replaces the mac address

1625
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,000
um the intention of this table is to say

1626
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,079
that for

1627
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,760
each of the use cases in the bottom left

1628
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:55,440
we may need a different identifier

1629
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,960
and those identifiers will have

1630
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,160
different applicability and

1631
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,720
different properties um

1632
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,558
it may be that some of them can you you

1633
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:05,439
can solve multiple cases with the same

1634
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,720
identifier

1635
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,559
um but certainly not saying that they

1636
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,439
they should all build on the on the same

1637
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,200
identifier because that would

1638
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,839
essentially be a replacement of

1639
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,839
the mac address

1640
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,919
thanks tim can you hear me

1641
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,440
yes okay i just wanted to respond to the

1642
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,039
friction piece right i think

1643
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,200
i fundamentally disagree with that the

1644
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:36,880
number one problem today

1645
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:39,359
is that there is too much friction and

1646
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,280
there's no consistency on how you get

1647
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:42,799
a secure identity onto a device

1648
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,480
specifically

1649
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:45,759
a a modern operating system right

1650
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,359
something what i would call a

1651
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,720
human-centric device like a laptop

1652
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,720
tablet or phone

1653
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,959
that is the that is why we could never

1654
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,399
even think about introducing

1655
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,000
any of these secure authentication

1656
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,160
methods into a home because we can't

1657
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,520
even get users in an enterprise

1658
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,920
to do it right if you the the shortest

1659
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,480
path

1660
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:05,119
to enroll as a user with a secure

1661
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,920
credential

1662
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:08,720
is 10 taps and the longest path on other

1663
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,640
operating systems

1664
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:14,399
is up to 27 there will never be success

1665
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,799
in getting a secure identity onto these

1666
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,799
devices if that continues

1667
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:20,319
and so i fundamentally disagree with

1668
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,759
that there's there needs to be more

1669
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,400
friction like there needs to be way less

1670
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,158
friction

1671
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:26,158
because at the end of the day you have

1672
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:29,198
to separate out the device identity

1673
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,519
and who you know what what

1674
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,318
you know directory or what user account

1675
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,920
that's bound to

1676
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:35,440
ultimately that that ends up being

1677
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,799
really more of an authorization decision

1678
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,519
right you can use the same device

1679
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,839
identity

1680
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,040
across 9000 networks but potentially

1681
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:42,479
have it tied to a different user

1682
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:53,839
identity based on context

1683
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:53,839
right so i i less friction not more

1684
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:01,198
okay thanks uh stephen uh

1685
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,199
just wanted to know what the like this

1686
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:06,318
slide is presenting a set of

1687
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:08,719
requirements derived from use cases

1688
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,040
for people who have who for whom mac

1689
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:13,040
address randomization causes some issues

1690
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,799
so it's inherently incomplete in that it

1691
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:17,839
doesn't kind of include

1692
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:20,560
the use cases for which mac address

1693
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:22,719
randomization was kind of designed

1694
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,080
so you know if if there's something

1695
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,920
going forward

1696
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,120
we need to kind of try and figure out

1697
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,480
what is a more complete set of

1698
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,759
requirements including things like you

1699
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:30,959
know better privacy

1700
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,640
and i'm not saying people are ignoring

1701
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,560
that i'm just saying that there's a

1702
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,319
there's a possible danger in saying

1703
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,679
that the set of use cases being

1704
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:39,040
considered so if you look at the the

1705
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:40,640
list on the left there it's kind of the

1706
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,799
set of things that get

1707
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,560
problematic in the face of randomization

1708
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:46,000
and i don't think the requirements

1709
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,040
should be derived only from that sort of

1710
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,040
problematic things

1711
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:51,359
if we decide to requirements analysis is

1712
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:51,359
useful

1713
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,400
so on that um i was kind of assuming

1714
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,520
that

1715
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:03,599
yeah we all we all agree that

1716
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:06,640
yeah privacy is is the aim in terms of

1717
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,040
randomization and that that is a given

1718
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,480
um it needs to be achieved so that's the

1719
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,360
reason why it's not really listed on

1720
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,400
this slide

1721
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,960
um but yes in order to do a proper

1722
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:20,799
consideration i can think yes

1723
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,800
it probably should be listed as

1724
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,000
uh i guess a kind of it is a requirement

1725
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:28,239
in there that needs it is probably an

1726
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,560
overriding requirement but it

1727
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,919
or at least it is the default position

1728
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,239
and then

1729
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,960
you then are trying to figure out how do

1730
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,159
you how do you modify that in order to

1731
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,640
to meet various cases sure i understand

1732
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,440
that

1733
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,280
i guess you know it seems to me that to

1734
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,320
do a good job on this one would also

1735
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,080
have to kind of consider

1736
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,679
what you might call abuse cases so the

1737
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:51,760
kind of in-store tracking that

1738
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,000
apparently some devices do

1739
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,280
and for advertising purposes and then

1740
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,640
because if you're going to propose some

1741
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,320
kind of change

1742
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:02,080
you also want to check does that change

1743
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,440
work well or badly for the things you

1744
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,320
don't want to happen as well as the

1745
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:06,320
things you do want to happen

1746
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:16,400
agreed okay

1747
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:16,400
thanks uh tell me

1748
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,159
all right hello um yeah so oh can we

1749
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:27,199
actually go back to the

1750
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:30,239
table slide if that's okay

1751
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:32,320
yeah thank you so yeah following up to

1752
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:34,799
steven's point

1753
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,440
i do think it would be useful to add

1754
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,000
more

1755
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:39,040
of the client privacy needs into this

1756
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,120
list as we're

1757
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,719
thinking about this as a whole and

1758
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:46,159
specifically so

1759
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:49,679
i'm speaking from the um apple

1760
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:51,839
client side right and what's important

1761
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,440
for me is that like any identifier

1762
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,199
metadata that's going to be shared by

1763
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,360
the client

1764
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,599
that would be consistent across networks

1765
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,000
or across different associations

1766
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,960
going forward it needs to be based on

1767
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,400
trusting the identity of the network

1768
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,400
and trusting the identity of the

1769
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:10,159
particular entity in the network that's

1770
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:12,639
going to receive that metadata

1771
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:13,199
so like here we you're listing security

1772
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,600
and trust

1773
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:17,440
and it's saying you know how confident

1774
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,400
must the network be that the client is

1775
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,960
the true

1776
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:22,239
owner of the identity and i think

1777
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,120
reflexively

1778
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:25,759
we need to talk about how is the client

1779
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,840
confident

1780
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,560
about the network or the particular

1781
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,760
entity on the network that's receiving

1782
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:34,239
this metadata or this identity um i mean

1783
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,520
sharing

1784
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:38,400
metadata needs to be done always with

1785
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,679
explicit

1786
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:44,159
client intent going forward i think and

1787
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,199
it needs to be sent in a secure way to a

1788
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,519
specific entity

1789
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:49,678
and not just blasted onto the network

1790
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,280
like the mac address is

1791
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:54,000
so i think we could also put on this

1792
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,400
table that we need to specify for any

1793
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,400
given

1794
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,759
piece of metadata or any identity that

1795
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,400
the client shares like

1796
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,679
exactly what entity on the network

1797
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,559
really needs to see that

1798
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,560
to operate on it and what are the um

1799
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,679
transport and security

1800
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,120
properties that we're using to

1801
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,120
communicate that metadata

1802
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:17,120
yep agreed yeah it makes sense to me

1803
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:20,080
yeah the client needs to have

1804
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,239
confidence of who it's transmitting that

1805
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,239
to

1806
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:35,440
uh yadi yes thanks uh

1807
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,599
so this is interesting um i think um

1808
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,799
i'm still like i agree with what thomas

1809
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:41,840
has said

1810
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:44,880
um but i i think we also went

1811
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,719
uh down to this this level quite

1812
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,880
quickly we started designing like what

1813
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:52,239
you know what are the requirements and

1814
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:54,320
and this new identifier system and so on

1815
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:56,000
and i was still struggling to make a

1816
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,480
decision at the higher level which is

1817
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,120
like

1818
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,879
what do we actually need in this this

1819
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,040
situation because it seems to me that we

1820
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,719
have a lot of technology we have

1821
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:09,120
randomization we have non-randomization

1822
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,159
we have lots of uh sort of user or

1823
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:13,920
network acceptable

1824
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,280
configurations and defaults we have uh

1825
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,840
identifiers at

1826
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,400
many levels like the mac and uh you know

1827
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,440
the

1828
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:25,759
login id at the web page

1829
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,159
iap eap uh identifiers

1830
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,960
and so on so so i'm still struggling to

1831
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:32,159
figure out like

1832
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,400
exactly what do we need in this space so

1833
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,639
it isn't entirely clear to me that the

1834
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,599
solution obviously is

1835
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,199
a new identifier system so it is of

1836
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,080
course true that people have

1837
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,960
uh different needs like you have you

1838
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,519
know people who want

1839
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,800
a total privacy and don't suffer from

1840
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,600
parental control or

1841
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,719
enterprise network issues and and and

1842
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,960
the people who

1843
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:56,400
have those things in this enterprise

1844
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,040
network you have to behave in a

1845
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:01,199
particular way

1846
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,280
but uh you know why wouldn't for

1847
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,839
instance um

1848
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,960
that the various defaults and settings

1849
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,000
be the right answer

1850
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,159
here or or perhaps some more information

1851
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,159
advertised by the networks that i i do

1852
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:16,159
or i don't do

1853
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:17,839
these kinds of tricks and and therefore

1854
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:19,839
the clients could make a better decision

1855
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:22,400
instead of introducing

1856
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,159
a new identifier system and i have to

1857
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:26,559
say that i'm also always a little bit

1858
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:28,159
scared about this new identifiers i

1859
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,640
i'm already identified by too many

1860
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,639
parties

1861
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:41,440
so um i'm wondering whether any of the

1862
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,239
other contributors want to

1863
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,239
respond to that

1864
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,599
yeah personally i'm not immersed in in

1865
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
in ieee enough to

1866
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,920
to know to be able to respond properly

1867
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,920
to that

1868
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:04,000
yes you're here can i can i can i come

1869
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,000
in

1870
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:11,199
please okay yes i think uh jerry i think

1871
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:13,360
what we try to say here is not about

1872
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,120
creating a new identifier sort of speech

1873
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,719
i think uh if there is any existing

1874
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,080
technology that we can leverage here

1875
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,600
we're happy to use it

1876
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,000
i think we are more like looking for

1877
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,320
guidance or looking for inputs

1878
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
uh to see what based on the use cases

1879
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,440
now we have and based on some of the use

1880
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,960
cases is broken

1881
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,599
what we need to do i think i need to

1882
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,960
echo what tommy said uh we

1883
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,640
often saying that hey the network

1884
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,480
trusting the device but we also want to

1885
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,159
see how the device can

1886
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:40,239
trust the network so that then they can

1887
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:41,679
and in exchange they can offer something

1888
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:43,919
for the network to say

1889
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,280
hey if i know who you are meaning that

1890
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:45,760
if i know this is not what i'm going to

1891
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,759
join

1892
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,280
meaning for example i go into the hotel

1893
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:51,520
i pay for it and then i have

1894
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:52,719
i want to join the i want to join the

1895
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,239
hotel network

1896
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,320
and then the network may be able to say

1897
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:59,360
hey in exchange like let's say in that

1898
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:01,599
period of time you can give me some

1899
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,040
uh persistent data and i'll just let me

1900
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,440
rephrase it i'll send a respectable

1901
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,960
system

1902
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,639
some of the data that we can use for

1903
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:08,560
that particular time frame

1904
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,320
that is the service that i can offer you

1905
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,840
and based on that contract which if that

1906
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,920
contract expired by time or

1907
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,960
the user can revoke that contract or

1908
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,480
even the uh

1909
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,719
the network can also revoke that

1910
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,120
contract then that that

1911
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,480
that that contract goes away so i think

1912
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
that is something that i mean especially

1913
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:25,839
for the home of the home user

1914
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,759
they don't have likes they don't have a

1915
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,120
lot of technical backgrounds they don't

1916
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,159
want us they don't understand when they

1917
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,679
have a problem

1918
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:34,400
say connecting a printer to the network

1919
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:36,159
or the printer change uh the identity

1920
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,599
and and then now suddenly it doesn't

1921
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,559
know that hey this is a printer or this

1922
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,560
is something else

1923
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,560
so those are the friction that we've

1924
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,440
tried to see i try to try to help the

1925
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,600
users to see if

1926
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,879
there's any better way to help them uh

1927
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,800
we're not like try to

1928
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,560
reinvent the wheel if there is any

1929
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,400
existing technology that we can use

1930
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,679
and i think what uh the chairs already

1931
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,679
begin i mean in the beginning when they

1932
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:57,440
when i mentioned the buff we are not

1933
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,199
it's not working group form involved

1934
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,799
we're more like gathering information

1935
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:02,719
and want to hear the community well how

1936
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,920
they feel about like is it something

1937
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,159
that

1938
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,800
we should put some energy to try to at

1939
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,719
least for example like try to build

1940
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,920
a best practice or bcp or something that

1941
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,560
can help the community to ease the

1942
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:27,840
easter to east the fiction or the

1943
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:27,840
challenge in the future

1944
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:33,599
okay thanks uh

1945
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:41,839
if you have in your play uh yadi or

1946
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,840
should we move to target

1947
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:49,520
yeah i guess um yeah much of that

1948
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:51,280
reply was about the details of the

1949
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,560
what the requirements are and of course

1950
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:53,679
you're not necessarily deciding a new

1951
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,719
thing but but

1952
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:59,360
maybe also think about pcps but

1953
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:59,840
i i guess i'm asking like why why isn't

1954
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,320
the

1955
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,320
you know defaults and settings enough of

1956
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,320
a response for the market need that we

1957
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,719
have because we

1958
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,080
we have the people who want this home to

1959
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:13,199
be totally

1960
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:16,239
privacy uh sensitive

1961
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:18,639
and and they know what setting to use

1962
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,839
we have the people who need to do their

1963
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,239
corporate network thing

1964
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,120
and they have the setting to use already

1965
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:25,120
and then there's like

1966
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,480
you know maybe some people in between a

1967
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,400
smaller fraction of

1968
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,040
of the market and it isn't clear to me

1969
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,159
like why would those people

1970
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:37,120
need some new technology

1971
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:38,159
or new identifiers then perhaps uh

1972
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,320
versus

1973
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:41,440
you know why wouldn't it be you know

1974
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,759
enough for them to

1975
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:48,000
you know set just set things correctly

1976
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,000
or improve the settings or defaults

1977
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,480
but but that's just the question that i

1978
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:55,120
have so that's fine

1979
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,120
let's move on

1980
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,440
thanks and uh by the way just uh

1981
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,640
as a reminder we have a mailing list

1982
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:08,000
assigned for this uh

1983
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:10,159
medina's discussion so

1984
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,120
please feel free to ask more questions

1985
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:15,120
later on or

1986
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:20,080
during the time on the mailing list

1987
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,080
thanks so we can move on uh

1988
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,719
yeah so one tactical remark about the

1989
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,080
friction right so

1990
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,080
reducing the friction doesn't

1991
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,920
necessarily mean that you immediately

1992
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,320
open yourself up to denial of service

1993
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,880
attack

1994
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:33,920
because i don't necessarily need to have

1995
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,719
arbitrary

1996
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,719
many and arbitrary fast changing

1997
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,880
identities right i just want to have you

1998
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:44,480
know frictionless identities and

1999
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:47,520
you know i probably prefer to have

2000
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:49,919
a lot more insight into you know what is

2001
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,360
my user experience right now

2002
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,719
this may be the generic uh suggestion i

2003
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,839
would give

2004
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,520
what is done here is very much trying to

2005
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,719
analyze the situation from the

2006
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,360
perspective

2007
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:05,760
of the provider of the use case not of

2008
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:08,320
the consumer of the use case right so

2009
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:10,400
it might be good to to to start up

2010
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:12,239
putting together the aspects of

2011
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,599
what is the user experience right what

2012
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:16,159
is the friction

2013
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,120
what is basically you know the privacy

2014
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:19,440
that i have

2015
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,040
right whom do i need to trust to keep

2016
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,759
that privacy right

2017
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,960
uh what are my processes to create the

2018
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,600
identity

2019
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,600
um you know what are the options for

2020
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,159
this identity to be broken in terms of

2021
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,159
to

2022
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,199
somebody mapping that identity back to

2023
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:35,839
me right so

2024
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,799
that user experience view uh you know

2025
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,000
would help a lot

2026
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,400
to put together uh you know exactly

2027
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,800
these

2028
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,920
user experience aspects and then

2029
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,920
basically map

2030
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,440
between what the proposed solutions are

2031
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,080
and what the user experience is

2032
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,480
and that's kind of you know competing to

2033
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,519
uh

2034
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,000
what what the provider of of of the use

2035
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,840
case

2036
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,840
of course wants to get

2037
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:15,360
okay next in the queue

2038
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:18,880
andrew yeah hi

2039
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,839
um i i think there's a lot of support

2040
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,920
for for

2041
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,360
to be mindful of the user experience and

2042
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:26,159
less friction

2043
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,599
um but really all i wanted to say um

2044
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,799
just having been encouraged to echo a

2045
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,120
point i made on the list

2046
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,400
is seems to me that this discussion is

2047
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:36,400
another example

2048
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:38,239
of where currently it's clear that

2049
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,480
developers network operators don't

2050
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:42,879
really understand each other's needs

2051
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,080
uh and ways of working uh particularly

2052
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:47,120
well

2053
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,120
and one observation for the this

2054
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:51,840
discussion is achieving is

2055
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:52,800
at least helping bridge that gap a

2056
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,080
little

2057
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,400
um so that rather than saying

2058
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,480
how people shouldn't do things

2059
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,400
understand what the actual reality is

2060
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,559
um and then see if there's a better way

2061
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,879
of doing things rather than

2062
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,760
ignoring the reality that's that's there

2063
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,199
so

2064
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,960
i just wanted to comment that i think

2065
01:23:09,199 --> 01:23:14,400
the discussion's

2066
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:16,159
really helpful in getting developers and

2067
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:20,159
network operators talking to each other

2068
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:24,239
so thank you

2069
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,239
okay thanks for that um

2070
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:27,040
uh jerome

2071
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,480
follows um i also think it could be

2072
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,400
interesting to um look at these use

2073
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:38,400
cases from a layer standpoint

2074
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,599
and you know i may be biased by by the

2075
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,199
fact that this slide comes in the

2076
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,520
context of

2077
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:45,360
us looking at multiple operating systems

2078
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,719
behavior before

2079
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,799
and how you know there seems to be no

2080
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,719
consistency between different operating

2081
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,679
systems on how they generate random mac

2082
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,639
addresses

2083
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,199
and by the way there's an uh typo in ios

2084
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:58,320
uh

2085
01:23:55,199 --> 01:24:00,159
in the ios table ios does not rotate in

2086
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,280
the final version it's it's more like

2087
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:04,559
android

2088
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:06,719
q and r it's sticky to the ssid but with

2089
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,719
a you know slight slight differences

2090
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,760
um but then you know we talked about mbo

2091
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:14,480
and it seems to be

2092
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:16,960
an ieee problem more than itf problem

2093
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:19,759
i see here uh association and post

2094
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,639
association that smells a lot like 80.11

2095
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,840
as well

2096
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:26,159
um the mac rotation scheme uh for the

2097
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:28,560
client also to me is something that the

2098
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:30,719
is probably very interested in

2099
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,679
looking into at least in the 802.11

2100
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:33,280
context

2101
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,040
um so it might be interesting for us

2102
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,360
also to triage a little bit

2103
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,120
uh those layers to you know to see what

2104
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:45,839
is probably taken care of

2105
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:45,840
at the ieee and what the itf could do

2106
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:54,000
yes thanks uh jerome indeed that that's

2107
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,839
part of the

2108
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:57,120
questions that we would like to to to

2109
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,440
answer and

2110
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,400
therefore we were very keen on

2111
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,799
highlighting uh

2112
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:04,638
the the work that is uh that has

2113
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,159
happened at i triple the 802 and that is

2114
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:08,239
going on right now

2115
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,440
but uh please feel free if you have more

2116
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:12,480
details uh to

2117
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:15,440
to let people know on the mailing list

2118
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:15,440
that will be great

2119
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,840
time

2120
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:34,959
hey um so tommy uh tommy maybe kind of

2121
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,560
start turning this in my head a little

2122
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,560
bit i think you know i

2123
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,000
i will be fully blunt here that i don't

2124
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,760
i do not think ietf is the right

2125
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,920
place to address this um which i said in

2126
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,120
the chat but if it does continue i think

2127
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,880
we have to

2128
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:50,960
step further back and look at

2129
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,639
right one thing that's concerning to me

2130
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,520
is you know and this is the problem you

2131
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,040
know

2132
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,360
while i do believe something like

2133
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,760
passpoint and secure wi-fi roaming is

2134
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,080
the

2135
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,760
go forward option it does not eliminate

2136
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,559
the fact that the local network

2137
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,760
operator can see the traffic right it

2138
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,440
protects the identity

2139
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,040
but it doesn't stop the fact that a

2140
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:10,559
local network operator can see the

2141
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:13,040
traffic traversing their network

2142
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,639
and users don't know that users do not

2143
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,600
understand when they go to mcdonald's or

2144
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,880
the home depot

2145
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,719
and their phone automatically connects

2146
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,880
to a network that that

2147
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,239
venue can see all of their traffic and

2148
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,400
sure many will argue there are

2149
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:25,599
technologies coming tls 1.3 etc that

2150
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,159
would make that harder

2151
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,719
but think about how many devices spew

2152
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,679
out

2153
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:33,440
device names at l2 that are unencrypted

2154
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,400
right it'll be very easy for me to

2155
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,799
figure out

2156
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:37,679
even without passing a device identity

2157
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,280
you know at a

2158
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,440
and for any form of authentication or

2159
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,960
authorization that this is john's iphone

2160
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,678
right it literally yells it to the

2161
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:46,400
network

2162
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:46,880
so i think we have to step back and look

2163
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,879
at

2164
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:51,120
you know to tommy's point how does the

2165
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,199
network identify itself to you

2166
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,239
and what level of consent does the user

2167
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,400
actually give to

2168
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,919
to to these layers and kind of to

2169
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,839
jerome's point in a way like where

2170
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,120
you know what am i consenting to when i

2171
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:03,280
connect to a network

2172
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,719
and so i while i you know i think we

2173
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,920
have to address these together because

2174
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,120
ultimately i think

2175
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,800
otherwise we're gonna end up in a loop

2176
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,320
solving different problems but at the

2177
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,920
end of the day like today

2178
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,440
there's really is no great way for a

2179
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,440
network to prove

2180
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:16,719
who it is like there's no i mean it's

2181
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,480
the age-old problem of

2182
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:20,000
you know you can't you can't really put

2183
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,678
an ssid into a cert

2184
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,360
right and passpoint and hot spot too and

2185
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,800
all these things have ways to

2186
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:26,480
potentially address them but they're not

2187
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:29,440
perfect right and and

2188
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,879
you know it kind of brings back the you

2189
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,638
know the thought of like could you bind

2190
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,719
a domain name to an ssid right should

2191
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,639
ssids just be domain names right

2192
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,239
and the user can be assured that when

2193
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:39,840
they connect to this they are using an

2194
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,480
identity from that domain or that's

2195
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,760
protected

2196
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,759
or that they've given the appropriate

2197
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,320
consent for both their identity be

2198
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,560
shared

2199
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:49,440
and their traffic to be sniffed right

2200
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,440
because that's ultimately what's

2201
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:02,560
happening

2202
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,560
yeah i think that those are good points

2203
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:08,000
and just uh to to

2204
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:10,800
step in here quickly uh the we are

2205
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,960
making sure that uh we don't step onto

2206
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:16,239
other organizations grounds

2207
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,560
uh as mentioned before by by eric we are

2208
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:21,120
making sure that we coordinate uh

2209
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,440
as much as possible if need be with ieee

2210
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:26,159
802 for instance if it's about

2211
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,080
uh mic addresses or procedures on how to

2212
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:31,360
associate authenticate or

2213
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,920
and so on for a wi-fi or the the usage

2214
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:35,839
of

2215
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:39,120
an ssid um however uh we still want to

2216
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:42,639
understand if ever there's something uh

2217
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,920
an ietf that has to be done even if it's

2218
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:46,719
just informing

2219
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:50,080
about issues that may be open up by

2220
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:50,080
identifiers that are

2221
01:28:54,840 --> 01:29:08,719
misused

2222
01:28:56,239 --> 01:29:08,718
so moving on uh joey

2223
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,000
okay all right

2224
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,400
i think it's working so i'm just gonna

2225
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:16,480
start talking even though i agree

2226
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,519
with okay thank you even though i agree

2227
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,839
with team

2228
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:20,880
um i think that the lack of end user

2229
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,679
knowledge uh

2230
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,080
shouldn't really prevent us from working

2231
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:26,560
on

2232
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:28,320
at least informational documents or

2233
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,760
additional options that can

2234
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:32,239
that can be used for at least some of

2235
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,239
these use cases um

2236
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:36,000
the purpose of the buff seems to me that

2237
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:37,040
it's eventually to come up with new

2238
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:40,320
identifiers

2239
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:41,840
uh like chris said i think that for the

2240
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,199
use cases where

2241
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:48,159
where the end user can simply not

2242
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:49,599
use mac address randomization i think at

2243
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:51,360
least for those

2244
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,440
we should try to establish a clear

2245
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:57,440
baseline of

2246
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:59,120
trying to strengthen the user experience

2247
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,879
and also

2248
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,400
to make sure that there's going to be

2249
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,400
informed consent

2250
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:06,400
when they choose to not use the

2251
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:08,400
randomization options

2252
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,559
for some of the specific use cases that

2253
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:12,719
were explained before

2254
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,400
that is the minimum baseline as we

2255
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:17,199
probably work towards

2256
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,320
coming up with new identifiers or at

2257
01:30:17,199 --> 01:30:20,320
least

2258
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,840
informational or bcp documents that

2259
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:23,679
would address

2260
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,960
what would happen if new identifiers

2261
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,840
become available

2262
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:34,000
and if the if they become target for

2263
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:37,040
different types of user tracking

2264
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,960
um yes i'm just going to

2265
01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:42,320
to reply uh to the comment about uh the

2266
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,159
purpose of the buff is to come up with

2267
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,639
new identifiers uh just to want

2268
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:48,719
to clarify that that's not the purpose

2269
01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:51,280
of the buff uh

2270
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:51,760
because uh we in fact what we want to

2271
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,920
make sure

2272
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,920
is that we first of all understand the

2273
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,320
work that is happening elsewhere

2274
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:59,120
uh so that we don't duplicate if ever uh

2275
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,280
there's uh

2276
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:03,519
work happening and as as mentioned

2277
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,559
earlier on uh already there's

2278
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,080
uh work about privacy and how to deal

2279
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,440
with my contrast randomization that i

2280
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:11,600
triple eight or two

2281
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,480
specifically in eleven there's two new

2282
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,159
parts

2283
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:19,040
um uh also uh the purpose of the buff is

2284
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:20,719
basically to to first of all inform of

2285
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:22,719
these new activities

2286
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:24,400
and then inform about the the issues

2287
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,400
that are happening and it's true that

2288
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:29,599
right now the discussion is moving uh

2289
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:32,480
very much around around the identifiers

2290
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,480
but rather than saying that the purpose

2291
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,440
of the buff is to define new identifiers

2292
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:38,080
i think

2293
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,960
we want to understand uh as for instance

2294
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,239
yari said

2295
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:44,320
do we need identifiers i think what we

2296
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:47,360
want to finally finalize achieve

2297
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:50,320
means to to provide services uh

2298
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:52,320
and we have heard both views so far uh

2299
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,880
there's a device view there's a network

2300
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:55,040
view

2301
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,320
and there i would actually add the the

2302
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:58,639
user view

2303
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:01,120
so uh right now we are just having an

2304
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:04,000
open discussion trying to understand

2305
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:06,960
what exactly is out there and both in

2306
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,239
terms of uh solutions and in terms of uh

2307
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,960
issues uh so that we we can then

2308
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:14,480
uh take a decision on how to move

2309
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:16,400
forward

2310
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:18,239
specifically on the ietf but also

2311
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,440
perhaps just informing other

2312
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:26,400
sdos about things that they want they

2313
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:28,719
may want to consider

2314
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,719
um

2315
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,880
addressing that specific question like

2316
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,120
should the ietf

2317
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,239
get involved at least in informational

2318
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,400
documents for this

2319
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:41,440
uh then yes i think i think yes we

2320
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,080
should

2321
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:46,480
and that's it thank you okay thanks

2322
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,559
thanks jerry

2323
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,400
we we will actually try to to get into

2324
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,840
uh those type of questions but that's uh

2325
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:54,879
useful feedback

2326
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:58,239
thanks so moving on

2327
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,239
uh chosen

2328
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:08,480
um i think the mac address net

2329
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:12,000
iph is mostly widely used

2330
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:15,919
in the consumer device or in business

2331
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:18,080
daily business or in the evening

2332
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:20,400
in industry isn't that used in mac

2333
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:23,679
address so there's a

2334
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:24,559
so if we make some changes i think where

2335
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:26,960
a lot of

2336
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,080
changes to the the based on this

2337
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:31,360
mechanism

2338
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:34,800
like we change ipv4 to ipv6 it

2339
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,719
takes a very long long time also

2340
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,679
also we also need a consideration from

2341
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:42,880
the same story from ipv4 to ipv56

2342
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,520
we need a consideration some device does

2343
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,280
not

2344
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:50,159
support this magnet's change

2345
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,800
and and we need a consideration maybe

2346
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:53,199
some

2347
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,480
yeah supported change other than not

2348
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:57,360
supposed to change

2349
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:58,400
also if we support this new tent we need

2350
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,400
a major

2351
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,000
introduce an additional signaling

2352
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:04,000
traffic to identify

2353
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,520
who you are because you change your mind

2354
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,280
us and either identify you

2355
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:12,800
who you are and maybe you also needed to

2356
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:14,960
detect a duplicated mac address because

2357
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,920
we assume the mercury is never

2358
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,040
duplicated but

2359
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:22,480
now making a duplicate and in that case

2360
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:25,199
where you can interrupt or deny service

2361
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,400
to others i produce a duplicate address

2362
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:29,280
to

2363
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:31,199
interrupt your communication so inside

2364
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,440
the case we need to also consider

2365
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:36,080
the user experience and keep the safety

2366
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:37,839
and keep service continuity

2367
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:40,719
also i said that the mac address is

2368
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:44,080
widely used in a lot of standards

2369
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:45,679
i think even in inferiority in cvp

2370
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:48,000
standard they

2371
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,760
they use the faculty in immunity is a

2372
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,400
network they use the ue

2373
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:53,679
mac us to add to the authentication

2374
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:56,159
identification

2375
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,960
or the packaging and the routing so i

2376
01:34:56,159 --> 01:35:00,799
think

2377
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:03,920
just said before previous people that

2378
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:06,639
ietf maybe is not the only standard

2379
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,719
organization to do this job maybe we

2380
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:12,840
need a coordination with a lot of

2381
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:15,840
standard organization to do this thank

2382
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,840
you

2383
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:23,679
okay thank you thanks for the feedback

2384
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:23,679
um bob

2385
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:31,840
hi um yeah a couple of thoughts um

2386
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:32,719
so i'm not really sure exactly that this

2387
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,960
is something

2388
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,320
the itf should do or exactly what it

2389
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,719
should do

2390
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,559
it seems like in the examples on this

2391
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:42,880
slide a lot of these are just

2392
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,159
you know bad implementations if i can

2393
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:46,639
use those words

2394
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:47,440
like a dhcp server that doesn't have

2395
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:49,840
enough

2396
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,280
big enough tables to handle a lot of

2397
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,920
devices

2398
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:55,440
and you know mac addresses were used for

2399
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,760
a lot of things they weren't intended

2400
01:35:55,440 --> 01:36:00,879
for for a long time and

2401
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,480
so now they're not stable but some of

2402
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,840
the issues that are being talked about

2403
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:07,119
are not just

2404
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:10,560
mac addresses like in ipv6 which

2405
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:13,440
by the way we've sort of have built

2406
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:15,840
support in for random mac addresses

2407
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,759
a while ago now you know we always had

2408
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,199
the notion of there being multiple ip

2409
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,360
addresses and

2410
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:23,519
devices could have many and you could

2411
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,280
change your interface identifier

2412
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,400
but some of these same issues about

2413
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:31,280
identity and so forth apply

2414
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,000
at the ip layer too it's not just use

2415
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:35,119
you know

2416
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,920
mac addresses and so i think this

2417
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,839
needs to be thought about you know

2418
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:41,920
broader than just

2419
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,360
you know at the link what happens at the

2420
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:46,800
link layer

2421
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:49,519
um and so i i think you know there's a

2422
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,199
lot of work here to do to sort of scope

2423
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,119
well first of all is there a problem the

2424
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:55,839
itaf can solve

2425
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:57,360
um because this is sort of the boundary

2426
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:00,159
between what the itef

2427
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:02,080
it's sort of it's not exactly itaf it's

2428
01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:04,638
not exactly ieee

2429
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,280
i'm not sure there's a good fit

2430
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,080
somewhere

2431
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:09,840
so we need to be very careful to just if

2432
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,760
we're going to do work

2433
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,080
that it's something we can actually do

2434
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,440
and make successful as opposed to just

2435
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,960
writing a bunch of drafts that don't

2436
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:21,839
have any effect on the industry

2437
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:21,840
thank you

2438
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:35,840
thanks a lot all right

2439
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,440
early

2440
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,920
and here i tend to agree that look

2441
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
at the other features and the example

2442
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,320
use cases it could be possibly related

2443
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:55,600
to

2444
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:57,759
a bunch of standardization standardized

2445
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,280
organizations so if we want to

2446
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:03,679
focus on the ietf work

2447
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,400
probably we can look we can start from

2448
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,760
looking at

2449
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:09,920
how it is related to the dhcp

2450
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,360
because in the especially in the fixed

2451
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,040
network access

2452
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,679
uh there there are a lot of

2453
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,719
implementations like dhcp snooping and

2454
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:20,800
the proxy

2455
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:23,840
i use the mac address and ip address

2456
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:27,040
together try to filter the

2457
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:30,159
the traffic so that could

2458
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:33,199
be a possible solid case that

2459
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:35,839
would be solvable in ietf that's that's

2460
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,839
what i thought

2461
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,839
okay thank you very much

2462
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:50,639
okay so

2463
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,440
can we move to the next slide

2464
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,040
so we have a few questions that we would

2465
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:01,360
like to ask

2466
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:03,519
and now that we have had a little more

2467
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:07,040
understanding on the different uh

2468
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,600
issues and uh status of things

2469
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,239
uh some of these questions already we've

2470
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,159
heard but

2471
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:14,400
we would like to ask them a little more

2472
01:39:12,159 --> 01:39:17,759
formally so that we can

2473
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,599
capture a race of hands

2474
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:21,119
so the questions are uh is there

2475
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:24,840
community interest

2476
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:27,440
on this topic and here we just ask

2477
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,159
openly uh for the whole community

2478
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:30,879
meaning people

2479
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:32,239
attending here then the second question

2480
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,960
is going to be are there any actions

2481
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:36,080
required

2482
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,800
at the ietf we don't know actions uh so

2483
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:40,080
don't read

2484
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:43,360
uh beyond those actions

2485
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:45,840
uh it could be uh

2486
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:47,119
information uh interactions with other

2487
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:51,360
seos

2488
01:39:47,119 --> 01:39:53,679
uh informational graphs pcps or so on

2489
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:56,400
and finally uh people will be interested

2490
01:39:53,679 --> 01:40:00,400
to work on this topic

2491
01:39:56,400 --> 01:40:02,960
so let's start with the first question

2492
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:05,440
is there community interest on this

2493
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,440
topic

2494
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:09,840
and

2495
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,480
if you click on the show of hands tool

2496
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,839
you will see there uh people are already

2497
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,840
clicking

2498
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,159
this is just a reminder if you want to

2499
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,159
not raise your hand there is an active

2500
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:37,280
choice in the show of hands tool to

2501
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:40,159
actively not raise your hand

2502
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:43,599
don't just wait and assume that that

2503
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:43,599
means your hand is not being raised

2504
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,840
thanks

2505
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:08,960
okay so the numbers are still moving uh

2506
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:12,639
the show of hands tool is on your left

2507
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:15,840
top side the graph

2508
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:20,080
next to the chat panel the icon looks

2509
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:20,080
like a bar chart yep

2510
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:26,960
okay

2511
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:33,840
so

2512
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:39,119
we close it now and uh so we have 53

2513
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,159
people raising hand

2514
01:41:39,119 --> 01:41:46,239
uh five people not raising hand out of

2515
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:51,440
a hundred

2516
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:51,440
great so

2517
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:56,960
the next question is um

2518
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,320
are there any actions required at the

2519
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,440
ietf

2520
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:04,559
and here again um

2521
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:05,440
we don't necessarily know what type of

2522
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,480
actions we are

2523
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:09,759
asking openly uh whether an action is

2524
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:13,280
simply informing

2525
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,119
other sdos about uh issues

2526
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:16,639
or highlighting things that they might

2527
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:18,880
want to consider

2528
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:20,000
uh it could be informational drafts it

2529
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,639
could be vcps

2530
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,400
or something else that we don't have not

2531
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,239
considered yet

2532
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,280
so do people think that there are any

2533
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:32,080
actions required are the idf

2534
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:43,840
please raise your hand if you think so

2535
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:43,840
or do not

2536
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:59,760
okay so we can close it now i think it's

2537
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,759
stable

2538
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:07,199
we have 36 10 100.

2539
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,880
can

2540
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,040
you really can't answer this question

2541
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:25,839
because there's nothing on the table

2542
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:25,840
it needs more work first

2543
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:32,799
sorry sorry is that uh which question

2544
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:38,320
are you referring to does

2545
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:40,480
the second question

2546
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,799
i mean it's it's way too open-ended in

2547
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:46,320
my opinion

2548
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:48,639
okay yeah and and by the way we

2549
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,759
kind of left it open-ended because this

2550
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,800
is a non-forming

2551
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,040
uh working group uh buff

2552
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:56,239
and we just wanted to get the high level

2553
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,440
feedback but

2554
01:43:56,239 --> 01:44:00,879
indeed uh depending on the the results

2555
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,400
and the discussion here

2556
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,840
uh we have to do our homework and

2557
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:09,440
perhaps uh going to

2558
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:09,440
into more detailed questions

2559
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:17,759
so the final question is would people be

2560
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,040
interested to work on this topic is this

2561
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:24,000
a topic of interest

2562
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:24,000
to people to actually do some

2563
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840
work

2564
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:49,840
it's still moving

2565
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:59,839
okay i think this we can

2566
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:08,320
close it now

2567
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:08,320
we have 39 10 98

2568
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:20,480
all right so

2569
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:23,440
this gives us a very good feedback uh

2570
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,959
there has been a lot of very interesting

2571
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:29,199
points actually

2572
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:29,199
from people and uh

2573
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,639
i think we we need to we look at all

2574
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,440
this uh

2575
01:45:32,639 --> 01:45:36,480
information and then uh see how we can

2576
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:40,400
consider it

2577
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:41,759
but we are getting close to closing and

2578
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,839
i see yari at the

2579
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,760
queue gary would you like to say

2580
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,760
something

2581
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,119
yeah just a brief comment that at least

2582
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,600
for me the last two questions were

2583
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,440
really

2584
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,119
really difficult so so maybe i would

2585
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,678
like to work on this if i was convinced

2586
01:45:53,119 --> 01:45:57,040
that there was

2587
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:59,520
a sort of a market need to address uh

2588
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:00,239
successfully and i think we didn't

2589
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,600
explore

2590
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:04,480
all the questions that uh we would need

2591
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,080
to explore

2592
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,678
for us to answer that but but certainly

2593
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,519
more research is needed like let's try

2594
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,679
to figure that out

2595
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:14,000
what would make sense in this space and

2596
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:16,960
not not just design

2597
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,960
new identifiers

2598
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,119
i would echo yuri that like without

2599
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,719
knowing what specifically we're planning

2600
01:46:27,119 --> 01:46:29,759
to work on it's very difficult to answer

2601
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:31,679
these questions

2602
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:33,440
but in addition to yara's point that

2603
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:36,800
he's interested in working on it

2604
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:38,080
if there's a good proposal i'm also

2605
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:40,000
interested in working on it if there's a

2606
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:42,080
bad proposal to try to make it less bad

2607
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,679
i think you know something coming out

2608
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:45,280
that that is problematic i do think we

2609
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:49,679
need to engage

2610
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,679
and um reduce the harms

2611
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,840
okay thanks good point uh alisa

2612
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:01,840
uh i was thinking that maybe an action

2613
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:04,559
item

2614
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,280
um that people can can take uh after

2615
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,679
this

2616
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:09,519
is it would be good to i mean we got a

2617
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:12,080
good overview

2618
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:13,440
about the work the related work in ieee

2619
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:15,920
it would be nice to have something

2620
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,638
similar for wba and wfa

2621
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:19,520
just to know like the scope of what's

2622
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:21,600
going on over there

2623
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:22,639
because it does seem like one part of

2624
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,960
this is just

2625
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:27,040
uh maybe motivating the industry to

2626
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:30,159
adopt some of the existing technologies

2627
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:33,119
so um i'm happy to work with people uh

2628
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:34,799
offline to you know get get something

2629
01:47:33,119 --> 01:47:36,400
authoritative from from those groups as

2630
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,960
well we don't

2631
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,559
uh usually work as closely with them

2632
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,000
directly but i'm sure that we can

2633
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:44,400
make that happen i think that would be

2634
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,400
valuable

2635
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,760
okay thank you

2636
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:01,678
to put as much information as we could

2637
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:04,000
on the on that informational draft

2638
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:04,800
so that we can inform people but but

2639
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,800
yeah if you can

2640
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:10,880
send some pointers or give us a name

2641
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:19,840
it will be nice to to get more

2642
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:19,840
information on that draft

2643
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:36,638
next high angle wonk

2644
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:36,639
we cannot hear you

2645
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,800
sorry we cannot hear you you need to

2646
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:51,119
press the mic

2647
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,119
okay

2648
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:56,400
all right so

2649
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:04,400
we have no one else on the q

2650
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:08,000
um i don't know eric would you like to

2651
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,000
say a few words

2652
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:12,480
indeed and and thank you jc and carlos

2653
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:14,880
for

2654
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:17,519
running this buff i think it's pretty

2655
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:20,080
clear to everyone that

2656
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,440
many people are interrupted by the topic

2657
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,920
and by the way

2658
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,960
a lot of information was exchanged into

2659
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:26,960
the chat

2660
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:28,320
and as we all know the chat i recorded

2661
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,520
so i put the link

2662
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:33,599
on the to the chat log into the menu so

2663
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,199
we can go back there and see the

2664
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:37,440
useful information that was exchanged

2665
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:37,440
there

2666
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,639
now the real question is indeed what do

2667
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:44,560
we need to do

2668
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:46,159
and do we need to do something and it's

2669
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:49,360
pretty clear that we have

2670
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:49,920
not an ideal view right now this could

2671
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,719
come as

2672
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:54,239
multiple sets from documenting

2673
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:58,000
informational draft

2674
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:59,839
bcp either for operators or even bcp for

2675
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,840
the ietf community

2676
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,840
uh because it changed somehow the the

2677
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:06,239
layer two and the interaction that the

2678
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:09,360
iplayer can have with the layer two

2679
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:13,598
so this could be documented somewhere

2680
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:15,360
so it's clearly no final decision here

2681
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:17,440
we mostly discuss a little bit more on

2682
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:19,440
the meaningless what to do next

2683
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:25,678
