1
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,519
all right

2
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,599
good morning good afternoon and good

3
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,520
evening everyone hopefully you can hear

4
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,039
me

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,039
we will go ahead and get started

6
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
welcome to the trusted execution

7
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,120
environment and provisioning

8
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:03,440
session in the ietf 109

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
we have a full hour

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:13,840
and dido you are with me

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,000
can you hear me yes now i can hear you

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,240
great

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,200
uh okay so we've got both chairs here

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,600
and we've got a full agenda for today

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,680
since we only have one hour

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,479
um this is in my normal ietf

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,119
session so the note will apply most of

18
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,240
you are familiar with it

19
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,720
for the agenda and again i want to thank

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,720
alessandro akira and

21
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,798
sukasa for being the note takers

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,439
um and i encourage the rest of you to

23
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,799
also look at the code emd

24
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,000
um which is where the notes

25
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,360
are being taken so this is the

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,599
agenda that we have today um

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
this is only a one hour session so

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,879
hopefully we

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,640
have enough time to get through all of

30
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,760
this and dave

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
i didn't have time and i forgot to uh

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,280
to send out the rats session

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
cancellation but

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
if we need to we can set up another

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,319
interim perhaps

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,160
not this week but um in a few weeks we

37
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,280
can do a doodle poll

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:42,239
um to further the work so

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,239
with that any comments on the agenda

40
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,799
no comments okay so

41
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,000
let me switch over to

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,720
the architecture and turn it over to

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
dave

44
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,000
okay great can you hear me okay

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,200
yes and it takes me a minute because

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
i'm not fully awake this one is going to

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,760
run a little bit longer than five

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
minutes but since we're two minutes

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
ahead i'm gonna take at least seven

50
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,840
minutes so

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,840
okay how come i'm not seeing

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,799
i'm trying to share your slides

53
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,040
and i'm not seeing them here says it's

54
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,640
being started

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,440
are you sharing them or you want me to

56
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
share uh

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,599
i was assuming you can share them i do

58
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,560
have them on my on my machine but

59
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,798
yep yep yep no i for some reason the

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,120
chrome tab wasn't working

61
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,120
um

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,120
okay well you tell me if you need me to

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,839
but okay there we go now we see it

64
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,840
all right next slide

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
all right so uh the architecture

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
document has been through last call as a

67
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
reminder at 108

68
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,439
we said uh there was two action items

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,879
moving some text and adding an unneeded

70
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
tas

71
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,399
and then we talked about in the minutes

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
right

73
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,599
you know what was an appropriate

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,600
milestone so next slide

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,520
so since itf 108 we did those two action

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
items

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
except for one thing the second action

78
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
item which was adding the unneeded tas

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,758
text

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,040
we revisited so a little over a month

81
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,120
ago october 16th

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
i posted the list the question that was

83
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,360
raised

84
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,599
that had to do with do we really want to

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
add unneeded tas to the list of things

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
that are

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,320
requested for rats claims so this is the

88
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
diagram that appears in the architecture

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,360
document and has for a really long time

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,719
uh you can see there's stuff that goes

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,160
from the

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,840
te or the t agent off to the tam

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,400
and then potentially the tam on the back

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,919
end uses a verifier to process the

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
evidence and tam is just passing that

96
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,198
through

97
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
and so the observation is that the

98
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,720
claims meaning the things that you ask

99
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
for from rats are things that go all the

100
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
way to the verifier and are important to

101
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
the verifier

102
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,440
whereas you know what goes in say the t

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
protocol messages that carry the

104
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
evidence well things that the tam

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,320
is about that the verifier doesn't

106
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,240
really and so

107
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,159
the question is or the point was well

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,440
this notion of requested tas and

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
unneeded tas

110
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
they're not really needed by the

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,039
verifier they're for use by the tam

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
and so the point was raised it says

113
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,000
actually put him in the rat's claims is

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,720
probably the wrong place because the

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
verifier doesn't care that tam does

116
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
and so the proposal was just put them in

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,759
the teat protocol messages

118
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
not um put them in the evidence because

119
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
the verifier doesn't care

120
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,799
there was no objections raised and so

121
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,280
that was done and you'll see that that

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,759
affects the transport spec too and so

123
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
now this uh principle that claims are

124
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,000
used for things that are important to

125
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,599
the verifier

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
protocol fields are used for things

127
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
that's important just to the tab

128
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
that's the principle that we try to use

129
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
throughout now

130
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,360
and so that one was done since ietf 108

131
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,400
but wasn't discussed before other than

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,479
on the list so next slide

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,679
again unless people have objections or

134
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,120
questions i'm going to keep going in the

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
interest of time

136
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
all right so there was this open

137
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,318
question about that uh thiru had asked

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
about clarifying the use of symmetric

139
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
keys to

140
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
erase it um the changes shown on the

141
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
screen

142
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,638
don't need to discuss unless somebody

143
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,199
wants to because tyro who allow the

144
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
issue

145
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,720
said it looks good and closed the issues

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,160
so next slide unless somebody has

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,759
something they want to discuss but i put

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,960
the text on the slide so people can stop

149
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,800
me if they want

150
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,159
and i'm trying to go fast because we're

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,360
going to be pressed for time yeah please

152
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
please next slide slide five

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
uh similarly we had a solicitor review

154
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,359
from russ housley

155
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,479
most of his comments or i should say you

156
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,919
know maybe half of

157
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,758
a little bit more of his comments were

158
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,198
addressed prior to 108

159
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,880
um some were not and so this is the

160
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,560
leftover ones the

161
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,319
remaining comments from ross you can see

162
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
the paragraphs that we did

163
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,680
uh the chairs verified and closed the

164
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
issue

165
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,520
uh so we believe that this one is also

166
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
uh done but you can see the text there

167
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,479
in case somebody

168
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
wants to discuss it i think we can just

169
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,800
go on

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,960
all right this one was another one that

171
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,120
was another list post from last month

172
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,799
and the issue here again was raised

173
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,759
since ihf-108

174
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,599
and the issue was as follows the term ta

175
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,240
in the document was defined as an app

176
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
that quote

177
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,479
runs in a tee where runs means to humans

178
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039
that there's code there and

179
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,878
it's not just a piece of data okay now

180
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
we already have text or had text in the

181
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,240
architecture document still there

182
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,759
that allowed for the t protocol to be

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,360
used to also install quote

184
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
personalization data

185
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
where that personalization data was

186
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
required by but not bundled with the

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,000
code right so you use the deep protocol

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,680
to install the code

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
and separately use the tek protocol to

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
install you know the data configuration

191
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
blob that it needs

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
but other text in the document only ever

193
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
talked about installing quote tas

194
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
right which implied that it could not be

195
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,000
used to install things that are just the

196
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,679
data blobs

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
and so hence the contradiction that was

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,039
purely editorial

199
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,560
now to resolve this there was already a

200
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,878
sentence in the document that used

201
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,879
lowercase trusted components

202
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,680
in a way that could clearly be read to

203
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,440
mean either a ta or personalization data

204
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
so the resolution was we just

205
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,399
capitalized that stuck in the

206
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
um terminology section to say whenever

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,440
we mean

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,439
either code or you know data only we

209
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,120
just use trusted components

210
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
and so this proposal was raised on the

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,799
list a month ago there was no objection

212
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,439
so right before the draft deadline we

213
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,120
just did it

214
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
and it's same in the other specs too

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,680
next i'm keeping an eye on the queue

216
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
so um i don't see anybody so just keep

217
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
going

218
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,920
all right so last week we had the

219
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
hackathon which um

220
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,680
akira is going to talk about later but

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
um one of the issues that we found

222
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,640
during hackathon was this one that

223
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,680
affects the architecture document

224
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
okay if you remember at ietf108 we had

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,839
this discussion

226
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,920
about um a way to tell the tam that you

227
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
don't need a ta anymore so that the tam

228
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,079
can then

229
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
choose to delete it if it wants to right

230
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,120
it's just a hint right because the tam

231
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,720
is authoritative

232
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,160
the problem we found was that although

233
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,200
we'd added a way to communicate

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
it in the protocol right from the keep

235
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,440
agent

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,800
we never said how the teap agent

237
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,920
actually gets that information to put

238
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
into the protocol

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,439
okay so if you say well what about the

240
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,760
request ta

241
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
uh how does it find the requested tas

242
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,200
and the answer was we had this

243
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,000
conceptual abstract api called request

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,360
ta

245
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,120
but there was no symmetric unrequest ta

246
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
and so you had half of the story and the

247
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
abstract api but not the other half and

248
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
there was this gap that we found during

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
trying to implement it and so the fix

250
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,959
was to add unrequest ta

251
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,560
next to request ta using almost

252
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,439
identical language except for saying

253
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,079
uninstalled

254
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
okay and again that issue again affects

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,000
all three documents but

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
again this was not in the posted

257
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,880
document yet because it was only found

258
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,399
during the hackathon last week

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
okay but there's already you can see

260
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,200
there's a per request there so there's

261
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,079
already proposed text which is on the

262
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
screen

263
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,839
and so the belief is unless there's

264
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,239
objections that we would uh

265
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,680
merge the pr right there's no text to be

266
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,160
written in case unless you don't like

267
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,120
the text so

268
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,399
next slide unless there's questions

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
we've got lots of issues in the tea

270
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,079
protocol to discuss

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,200
and so i i'm trying to go through the

272
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,880
things because most of these are

273
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
editorial only

274
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,920
um if you remember we had a discussion

275
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,519
before about removing text that talked

276
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,279
about security domains

277
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,720
out of the architecture document right

278
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
not that it's disallowed because you

279
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,279
might be able to use a suit manifest to

280
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
do things

281
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,720
with uh security domains but removed it

282
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,880
from the architecture document

283
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,560
however when we remove that text the

284
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,680
following paragraph that's in red was

285
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,119
left in there which

286
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,800
we missed because it doesn't use the

287
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
word security domain

288
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
but it's talking about a problem that

289
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
security domains solve

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
and it's under the heading the t

291
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,240
protocol addresses it well that's not

292
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,920
addressed by the t protocol it's

293
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
addressed by the suit manifest

294
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,120
and so the editorial fix is delete that

295
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,319
paragraph to say now we've really

296
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
deleted all the text that talks

297
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,000
specifically about security domains in

298
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,399
the tea protocol

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,320
and again this was uh it put a request

300
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
not in the posted one i see brendan

301
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,320
enqueues so i will stop here

302
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,319
go ahead

303
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,199
that's um the teep protocol

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
does actually address this by its

305
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,040
inclusion of the suit manifest

306
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:40,800
and i realize that's a small uh

307
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,560
niggle but it it strikes me that

308
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,359
it still does so are you proposing to

309
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,359
not delete it

310
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,760
because there's nothing in the

311
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,760
architecture document that says how this

312
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
problem is addressed

313
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,120
i'm not saying that it needs to be

314
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
deleted i'm just saying that

315
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
if there's a good reason to keep it then

316
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,199
i think it's still reasonable to assert

317
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,480
that the t

318
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,680
protocol does address the problem

319
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,760
my personal opinion

320
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
is that having the paragraph there

321
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,680
begs questions that are not answered and

322
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,920
so it's a confusing thing

323
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,680
i would put it into whatever the

324
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,199
document is that would say in the suit

325
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,560
manifest here's how to do security

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
domains which is not the architecture

327
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
document

328
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,320
that seems reasonable to me okay

329
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,839
all right trying to figure out if you

330
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
have an objection to removing it i would

331
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,240
say maybe

332
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,479
moving this paragraph to a different

333
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,920
document which we don't have a document

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,519
that talks about security domains in the

335
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,120
suit manifest yet but that's where it

336
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,320
would go in my opinion so

337
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,839
all right uh

338
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
your still list is being shown in cube

339
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,480
brennan so i don't know if

340
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,439
i'm gonna keep going i i can remove them

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
okay great

342
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,959
um all right so i'm going to try to

343
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,439
finish this one up here um so the last

344
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,359
one

345
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
is a something that has not been

346
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,560
discussed in the list yet and so you can

347
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,760
see there's a question mark

348
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,518
in the issue uh label here um and so let

349
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,920
me summarize this one by

350
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
saying this is a question i raised and

351
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,959
filed an issue on

352
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,319
so the working group can decide whether

353
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,199
we want to do anything right we could

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
choose to do nothing

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,360
okay and so the observation is that uh

356
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,079
the t protocol won't be used for

357
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,800
everything

358
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,760
okay three reasons for that number one

359
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,719
for sim chips

360
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,319
which have you know a a uh t-e-e and an

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
e-uicc sim chip

362
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
is already in wide used by mobile

363
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,800
operators and they're not using the t

364
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,839
protocol they're using the gsma protocol

365
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,599
and if you look at their architecture

366
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,240
document it has diagrams look just like

367
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
petite ones just with different labels

368
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,920
number two global platform already

369
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,439
standardized otrp which we didn't

370
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,439
they are now under the second version of

371
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,519
it meaning the second you know 1.1

372
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
instead of v 1.0

373
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,000
and so for secure elements gold

374
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,560
platforms are using otrp

375
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,079
third point if we go back a couple like

376
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,760
at least two years ago david wheeler

377
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,599
gave a presentation about you know

378
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
in when we were doing otrp about why a

379
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,560
bunch of stuff doesn't make sense for

380
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,880
sgx because there's no such thing as

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,359
enumerating tas in sgx

382
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
what does really install mean and so on

383
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,240
and so

384
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,519
classic use and by classic i mean the

385
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,320
uses that uh

386
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,560
david wheeler had in his presentation

387
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,399
one might assume that uh you don't need

388
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,880
to use the t protocol because what would

389
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,480
it do

390
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,800
and this came up also we were trying to

391
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
implement it um and so there's a

392
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
proposal that says we could explain

393
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
what teep is applicable for um and it

394
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
could be applicable to things in sgx

395
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,240
there was a presentation i gave on

396
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,160
behalf of mike purcell

397
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,160
about the anarchs project about a year

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,760
ago when we were talking about which

399
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,279
direction the transport protocol does

400
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
and so we said the heat protocol is

401
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,240
actually a use for that one but

402
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
transports in the direction

403
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
so last slide going to the next one

404
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
which is uh just showing some proposed

405
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
text in the per request should we choose

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
to do something

407
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,880
this is what we might say if we were to

408
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,519
say something

409
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,480
and so in the introduction section you

410
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,920
know it's applicable to

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,800
tees that can install and enumerate tees

412
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
in a tee secured location where another

413
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,479
domain specific protocol standard that

414
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,079
meets the needs is not already unused

415
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,639
that's an example of something we might

416
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,519
say

417
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
okay the sgx section and the trustzone

418
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,680
section we have sections on both of

419
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,199
those

420
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,839
which kind of imply when you read them

421
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,959
that protocol is applicable

422
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,880
and so all that text there is fine but

423
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,000
we might augment it with a paragraph

424
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,240
like these that say in which cases

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
it might actually be applicable to sgx

426
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
and this is using the nrx model without

427
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
ever using the word anarchs here

428
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,160
and similarly for trust zone where

429
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,399
there's multiple ta stores such as an

430
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
opti than anything where you can install

431
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,199
stuff in a trusted location it's

432
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
applicable for

433
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,880
so that's an example of what we might

434
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,880
say if we choose to say something

435
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,000
i would prefer to say something but it's

436
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,439
a question that i have for the working

437
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,279
group and i see hank in q

438
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,839
and this is my last slide so hank over

439
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,839
to you

440
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:03,040
hi this is dave this is so

441
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,959
it's only on morning day sorry

442
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,959
yeah thank you dave for rescuing me

443
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,959
so um what i was trying to ask is

444
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
um you said applicability i think that's

445
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,560
that's

446
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,000
a good point so um uh i've i've been a

447
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,839
little bit absent last

448
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,839
time in the uh wg meetings and now

449
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,040
i'm wondering what's the key difference

450
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,399
between

451
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,880
gsms and gp's

452
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,880
cheap flavors that already are there

453
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,199
what's what's this

454
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,399
solution bringing to the table is that a

455
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,800
applicability

456
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,720
uh content that should also be uh

457
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,479
highlighted somewhere

458
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,759
uh my i've looked at the gsma spec i've

459
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,040
looked at the otrp spec

460
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,079
my belief is that they are roughly

461
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,199
accomplishing the same

462
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,199
goals but gsma and otrp respectively are

463
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,800
for very domain specific purposes like

464
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,680
otrp has lots of security main stuff

465
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,758
built in

466
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,519
and gsma stuff has stuff that's very

467
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,720
specific to you know mobile operators

468
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,160
and sims and stuff

469
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,559
but at a high level they do the same

470
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,120
thing and so my belief is

471
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,599
gsma already has a deployed protocol

472
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,520
there's no incentive for them to switch

473
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,198
at least right now there's not similarly

474
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,720
global platform has a protocol there's

475
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,480
no incentive for them to switch

476
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,799
right but if you're designing something

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
for sgx or trust zone and you're in

478
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
these other use cases there's incentives

479
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,799
and so

480
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,079
um i i don't know of a reason to switch

481
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,639
but they are

482
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,520
a lot alike in terms of like i said if

483
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
you look at the protocol

484
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
the the architecture diagram you can

485
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,520
just change the labels it's the same as

486
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
our diagram

487
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,200
maybe they got some extra stuff for

488
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,120
their use case but

489
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
okay maybe put the other way around so

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,439
so why so this might be a

491
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,039
sounds harsh it's not intended to be

492
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,679
harsh so why did we

493
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,559
create cheap if we could have just uh

494
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,600
tweaked

495
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
existing protocols the other protocols

496
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
okay that one i do know because i was a

497
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,360
chair at the time and part of the

498
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,320
stuff um the other ones um are

499
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
not applicable outside their domain

500
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,600
right and so otrp

501
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,959
you can't really use it outside things

502
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,439
that don't have security domains and

503
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,799
it's in

504
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,880
a organization that's less open than the

505
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,320
iatf and so we said if you wanted to do

506
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,280
extensions to make it be applicable to

507
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,639
other things

508
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,799
um where would be the right place to do

509
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,440
it we said ietf

510
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,320
okay excellent so it's like the uh the

511
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
abstracted

512
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
generalized version of flavors that

513
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,120
exist okay

514
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,720
thanks exactly so that is probably

515
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,520
captured somewhere prominently

516
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
at the beginning yeah

517
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,039
thanks harness isn't you yeah yeah i

518
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,760
just wanted to add

519
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,799
um this is honest here um like there's

520
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,240
obviously a

521
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,559
a long history with otrb and why we have

522
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,000
chosen to design deep in the way

523
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,840
it is currently designed and i don't

524
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,679
think that history needs to go into the

525
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,159
document because it's obviously

526
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,160
like the dirty laundry of standards work

527
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
between different organizations and how

528
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,480
things can

529
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:09,520
uh go sideways in some sense um

530
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah one of the reasons why

531
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,679
otrb and deep now look different this

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,720
and i think this is quite important

533
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,919
um is that we made use of um

534
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,960
eat and and the rats work as well as

535
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,679
uh the suit work which i believe

536
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,559
and that's what if you look at the uh

537
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,240
the content

538
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,280
of the otrb protocol that's what most of

539
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,400
it talks about

540
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,879
and so we we managed to um

541
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,320
sort of generalize this and put it into

542
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,880
separate buckets and i think

543
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,840
that solution is uh like technically

544
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,160
much better it would be worthwhile to

545
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,520
um to describe those differences but

546
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,240
that would obviously be

547
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,080
be much longer i'm going to propose

548
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,880
since this one wasn't posted the list

549
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,159
we defer this discussion to the list and

550
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,720
because just got a bunch of other stuff

551
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,559
to discuss

552
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,600
and so i would propose the chairs called

553
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,480
time and we move on to the next

554
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,959
presentation not

555
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,960
this isn't important to discuss okay

556
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,400
just take it to the list yeah okay i can

557
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,760
do the next one in two minutes

558
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,760
uh which is the transport spec

559
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:24,080
you're on okay next

560
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,440
uh yep minutes say from iutf108 said uh

561
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,480
we're going to publish as soon as two

562
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
things are done

563
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
uh moving text and doing redirects next

564
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,960
slide

565
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,760
both of those were done um as well as

566
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,880
uh during the meeting ben cadec raised

567
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,919
some questions about

568
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,960
text referring to 2818 we just copied a

569
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,039
sentence from

570
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
uh an existing rfc that doesn't

571
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,120
reference 2018 so we match kind of

572
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,679
what's already gone through iesg

573
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,559
uh there was a discussion at 108 around

574
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,200
headers

575
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
uh so we removed cash control as hannah

576
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,679
said proposed

577
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,439
and there was one fix that when i

578
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,919
followed up with mark nottingham he said

579
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,080
unsupported media type should be 415 not

580
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,720
406. so we corrected that in the text

581
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,720
next slide

582
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,000
i only got one more slide so

583
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,159
please go to slide four okay there we go

584
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,480
only one new issue was raised which is

585
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,320
that

586
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,159
issue uh that we've already discussed in

587
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,840
the architecture document and so we made

588
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,919
similar changes here

589
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,439
um and there's the open pull request on

590
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,080
the unneeded ta that would affect this

591
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,400
stock too

592
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,240
again similarly if we accept it on the

593
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,720
architecture we accept it here

594
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
so that's it nothing new to discuss here

595
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,200
that we didn't

596
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,120
discuss during architecture or already

597
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,080
at 108 so

598
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,080
done cool

599
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,440
all right okay so i think akira's next

600
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,439
yes

601
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
akira

602
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,840
i think your audio should be working now

603
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
akira you need to push this microphone

604
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:41,840
button otherwise

605
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:41,840
just showing your q doesn't do the job

606
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,840
we still can't hear you akira

607
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,489
[Music]

608
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,559
well dave it's a good thing you went

609
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,320
fast

610
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,639
i figured it's going to take him another

611
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,639
minute

612
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:07,440
yeah it's interesting ben oh

613
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,840
well it may be my audio that it's

614
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,840
showing

615
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,840
because the cure is not on anymore

616
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,960
so

617
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,320
uh people who are engaged to be sending

618
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,039
audio will have like a greenish

619
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,760
background

620
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,559
and the microphone logo will be blue oh

621
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,760
yeah

622
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,799
participant list uh and so

623
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,158
at the time akira was in that state with

624
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:47,840
the blue microphone icon

625
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:47,840
and now i see him there in that state

626
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
hey akira we can still hear you

627
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,279
hello

628
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,279
is that akira or

629
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,720
no audio from akira okay so

630
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,520
let's um uh maybe we should switch to

631
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:15,360
the um

632
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,679
no other referendum so

633
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,799
dave why don't you do the protocol i

634
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,320
know we wanted

635
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,799
to get some of the feedback from the

636
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,840
hackathon but

637
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,840
and while akira gets his audio issues

638
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
resolved

639
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,480
uh audio working um but sure rather than

640
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
having

641
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,159
and we're just waiting let's go ahead

642
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:44,240
and start um because some of these

643
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,159
all right should we go ahead yes go

644
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,039
ahead all right uh

645
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,039
go ahead next slide

646
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,240
okay all right so there's a number of uh

647
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,000
issues uh there's three collectively

648
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,799
that i'll talk about here

649
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,679
uh that uh are introduced on the curious

650
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,360
slides

651
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,159
um and so today every teat message

652
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,360
has a token the token is an unsigned

653
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,240
integer

654
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,320
that uh the tam sends that agent echoes

655
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,760
back in the response

656
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,399
so this does require the tam to create

657
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,679
state to store the token even for a

658
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
query request

659
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,679
now a courier quest other than the token

660
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,439
is identical

661
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
to when it's sent to every client the

662
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,960
only thing that differs in query

663
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,960
requests is the token field okay

664
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,480
so that means that you have to keep

665
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,000
state and

666
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,600
there's no other reason in the query

667
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
request to keep state

668
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,158
the query response at least allows you

669
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,200
to or requires you to depending on who

670
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,799
you implement it includes the

671
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
attestation evidence

672
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,240
the attestation evidence already has a

673
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,080
separate challenge field that's in the

674
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,960
query request that's echoed back

675
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,320
in the attestation evidence okay so if

676
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,159
you think about well how do i do replay

677
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,918
protection i need tokens for that to

678
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,200
ensure you know freshness and so on well

679
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,159
you've already got the challenge field

680
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
for that

681
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,200
there's multiple layers of stuff going

682
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,918
on right there's the

683
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,840
tls layer which might terminate outside

684
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,320
the tees you can't trust that

685
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,399
there's the cose header there's fields

686
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,158
in the teep message like token

687
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
and then there's things inside the

688
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
evidence and so

689
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,960
since replay protection with evidence is

690
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,640
already done by the challenge

691
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,000
as long as you already have as long as

692
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,480
you're using the challenge and

693
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,080
the eat or evidence then you don't need

694
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,200
the nonce for purposes

695
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,480
of matching or uh replay protection

696
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,760
because you can already get that out of

697
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,799
the challenge okay

698
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,480
so if you do do a token

699
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,600
then this introduces this complex

700
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,120
question i ran into with the

701
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,639
implementation says so when do you clean

702
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,239
up state right so let's say

703
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,320
you send the query request and you never

704
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,760
get a query response right you actually

705
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
have to clean up state according to some

706
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,520
implementation to find things so there's

707
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
some complexity to deal with that okay

708
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,799
but does it actually buy you anything in

709
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
the query requesting response so the

710
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,360
first

711
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,799
question is could we just get rid of the

712
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,760
token and the query request and the

713
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,320
query response

714
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,600
okay now hold on that question for a

715
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,960
second here let's go on to the next

716
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,639
slide

717
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
it says does the token actually buy you

718
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,039
anything because out of the hackathon

719
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,720
implementers

720
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,080
none of us could come up with an idea of

721
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,360
why you needed a token in their career

722
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,279
request during response

723
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,479
given that you had the challenge and

724
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,440
that's echoed back in the

725
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,360
in the uh rats evidence so then you say

726
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,919
well is the token needed for install and

727
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,678
delete

728
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,440
right because you got to know which

729
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,640
install you're sending the success to or

730
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,679
which delete you're sending

731
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,440
the error to well and this is where i

732
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,799
wanted uh brendan to be part of this

733
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,799
discussion here

734
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,320
uh because again there's multiple layers

735
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,440
of stuff here

736
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,399
and today this in the latest drafts that

737
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,039
we have the

738
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,000
success and error message can include

739
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,919
suit reports

740
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
the suit reports have the results of the

741
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,440
install and the delete

742
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
okay and so in a suit report and this is

743
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,320
echoing stuff out of brendan's suit

744
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,720
report draft

745
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,399
there's a manifest digest that one is

746
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,320
what identifies

747
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
which suit manifest was being installed

748
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,279
or uninstalled that might have the

749
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,320
success of errors

750
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,919
and the suit record has you know a a an

751
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,080
array of zero more suit records that

752
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,640
have you know success or failure results

753
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,720
or

754
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,240
status points or whatever it is right so

755
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,000
you can already say

756
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,520
without anything you can always say

757
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,080
exactly what matches right because you

758
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,879
can use the

759
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,320
digest to match with the suit manifest

760
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
information and the install of the

761
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,678
delete

762
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,199
so my claim is i don't know that you

763
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,440
actually need a token for matching

764
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,679
purposes in the installer delete either

765
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,799
because we have the suit manifest digest

766
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,960
and things

767
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,960
so you can ask well what about replay

768
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,240
protection well how do you know

769
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
that the suit reports that you're

770
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,399
getting aren't replayed

771
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
by you know the re or something from

772
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,600
things that were

773
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
suit reports from you know last week

774
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,559
five months ago or something like that

775
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,200
how do you know the student reports are

776
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,480
fresh

777
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,840
okay and so uh again maybe you saw that

778
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
at the cose layer

779
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,120
maybe you saw it in the suit report

780
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,799
itself

781
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,479
but i don't know that you need to solve

782
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,320
it in the teep message

783
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,640
and so the proposal too is could we use

784
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,480
either the cose header or the suit

785
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
reports and not use the token and

786
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,000
installer delete either

787
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,200
and so let me open it up here because i

788
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,200
see conus is already in queue

789
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,159
so the the token uh which is uh

790
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,200
announced that it's initially

791
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,679
uh sent by the dam

792
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,120
and then uh relate back uh in the

793
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,760
response

794
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,120
um you said like you could also use the

795
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,480
nuns for that purpose but

796
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,479
it's not uh it's not

797
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,200
necessarily the case that the nonce is

798
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,520
always used uh when this the ban doesn't

799
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,080
need

800
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,879
attestation information then it wouldn't

801
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,879
use the nons

802
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,559
and so i think two things we talked

803
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,320
about during the hackathon one is

804
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,000
is there any such case where you would

805
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,080
not want to include the evidence

806
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,039
and number two if there is could you

807
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,820
just have the token

808
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,519
be optional and only used in such a case

809
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,840
[Music]

810
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
and number three are you actually buying

811
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,760
anything given that the suit

812
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
that they sorry that the query requests

813
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
are identical

814
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,159
can you d and this goes back hon as to

815
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,679
that question about can you accept

816
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,679
unsolicited query responses

817
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,919
yeah so for me um like the reason why

818
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,720
there was the need to associate the

819
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,399
response to request was uh we said um in

820
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,159
the architecture document that we may

821
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,918
have actually multiple

822
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,760
uh des on a single device and this is uh

823
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,080
request it needs to know um how to match

824
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,440
uh one request to the other i think

825
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,199
that's where it came from

826
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,880
initially um but if it comes if you need

827
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,080
to know which te it is you'd kind of

828
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,440
want the evidence for that case

829
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,279
because the evidence should have the te

830
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,919
identifiers which i see hank is in queue

831
00:31:51,279 --> 00:32:00,399
because that was disgusting

832
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:02,159
well and i see brennan's up first so

833
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,760
that when i wrote this i had assumed

834
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,600
that there was going to be

835
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,720
a replay protection layer um underneath

836
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,000
the suit report um but i don't see a

837
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,000
problem with including it

838
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,279
and i think pretty much anywhere that

839
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,799
it's used uh

840
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,440
replay protection is probably going to

841
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,600
be a question so uh it probably

842
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,440
needs some kind of counter in there but

843
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,080
i suspect it needs to be very loosely

844
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,279
defined

845
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
because the uh the content of whatever

846
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,399
uh token

847
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,919
if you will the suit report contains is

848
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,360
probably highly application dependent

849
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
yeah you can see my bullet there

850
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,158
probably applies to suit reports in

851
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,919
general so when we

852
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
uh have this discussion the suit working

853
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,080
group later this week um

854
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,000
we might want to have this issue in suit

855
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,918
uh because this is probably not teach

856
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,399
specific right suit reports in general

857
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:49,440
keep

858
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,600
one of the ways to convey it i think

859
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,840
it's actually more general question yeah

860
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,840
indeed i i agree with you on that

861
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
okay

862
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,240
so hi this is hank so i i heard the term

863
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,799
evidence so then i

864
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,640
my attention was packed of course um so

865
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,960
my assumption is that the request does

866
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,200
not

867
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
include a heat but the reply will

868
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,600
substitute the nuns for the eat

869
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,159
or i expected the time to issue a uh eat

870
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,439
on the

871
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:23,279
uh on the uh request also i i

872
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,240
didn't see the request

873
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,600
the request can include a challenge

874
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
which you can interpret as being

875
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,158
nonce but it could be something more

876
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,720
than a knowledge just depends on what

877
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,279
the

878
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,159
uh what the mechanism is so when i say

879
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,600
challenge you can

880
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,080
re you can hear that as saying oh he

881
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,039
said nahs right so the request has a

882
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
challenge

883
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,720
the response includes the evidence as

884
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,960
long as the

885
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,960
uh tam requested it and so the challenge

886
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,200
is used in computing the evidence

887
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
so and the evidence is it by default and

888
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,640
eat yes

889
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,919
okay so you basically would not uh uh uh

890
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,360
return the um uh challenge content but

891
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,960
the challenge content is then nested in

892
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,918
the evidence and that would be

893
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,440
yeah uh so not to say that yeah so in

894
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,320
your reference interaction model

895
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,440
right you have a nonce generated by the

896
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,760
verifier

897
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,560
uh and so that's the challenge and then

898
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,200
the

899
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,719
uh nonce is then included inside the eat

900
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,158
to give freshness and

901
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,118
that's what is done here okay but

902
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,919
that that that by extension also adds as

903
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,839
the uh

904
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,679
uh included nones for the streets for

905
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,000
the term sorry for the uh

906
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,839
response to the jam so that is like the

907
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,960
double layout announcement to speak okay

908
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
that is fine i think it's

909
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,879
a good idea and the uh uh and i just

910
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,960
want to have a small comment here

911
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,078
clarifying comment on the reports

912
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,119
uh so the suit report was created

913
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,839
with evidence and attestation results in

914
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,960
mind

915
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,480
so it's ease of computability so

916
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,199
it's relatively high uh highly refined

917
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,918
uh evidence claims here that could be

918
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,240
used

919
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,920
probably even in metrics for attestation

920
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,839
results it's relatively easy

921
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,839
without a complicated policy

922
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,160
okay so i think so far what i'm hearing

923
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,280
just to summarize the last three

924
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,680
speakers put together

925
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
is just that um there might still be a

926
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,680
case for a token

927
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,839
but maybe it's not uh required maybe

928
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,440
it's optional and i think akira has in

929
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,599
his deck a slide that

930
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,359
uh shows the different uints and things

931
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
that was one of the proposals and so

932
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,400
i'll let akira cover that uh option in

933
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,800
uh

934
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,480
his slides and but otherwise i think we

935
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,400
actually depend on the resolution to the

936
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,560
suit discussion to resolve this one for

937
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,560
sure

938
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,839
um yeah i i'm okay with having it uh

939
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
optional in the in the response but i

940
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,119
believe um

941
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,400
we need to have a replay protection

942
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,079
mechanism in there

943
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,680
i sort of not the replay but the

944
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,400
liveness uh

945
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,319
guarantee because uh when we create the

946
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,880
signature over the message of a response

947
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
message

948
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,760
uh there has to be something that proves

949
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,880
that it has been created uh

950
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,359
recently um and that should be undangled

951
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,280
from

952
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,759
uh the eat uh likeness check which you

953
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,520
uh talked about i'm happy to do a formal

954
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,560
analysis to make sure that uh

955
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,520
the brotherhood is fine sounds good

956
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,520
thank you for volunteering

957
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,119
okay hey any other any other questions

958
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,480
on this one hank or brandon you have

959
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,480
follow-ups go ahead

960
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,760
yeah so there was a comment that you

961
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,839
made about

962
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,960
the um about using it for attestation

963
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,240
hank specifically

964
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,320
you made that comment um i

965
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,919
i did look through that and i discussed

966
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
that with um

967
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,119
with dave and i think the conclusion

968
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,400
that we came to

969
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,680
was that uh using it for attestation

970
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,119
might be possible but that it's probably

971
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,720
more complex than

972
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,359
is necessarily useful for attestation

973
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,399
purposes

974
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,319
as a general case okay

975
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,000
so i would propose that we have that

976
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,599
follow-up discussion in the suit working

977
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,800
group um rather than

978
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,440
here because we have other issues to

979
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
talk about so

980
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,599
if everybody if everybody's fine with

981
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,920
that i'd like to go to the next slide

982
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,320
but hank you're still in queue so any

983
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,320
last thing to say okay

984
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,599
yeah so time tech um

985
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,000
tell me what akira said he didn't need

986
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,800
the full

987
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
15 minutes so if we gave him 10 minutes

988
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,520
okay that's fine

989
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,960
so we'll go for another 13 minutes yep

990
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,960
13. okay thank you

991
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,240
just cut me off because i i i believe

992
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,599
that we have more slides and we'll get

993
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,359
through so we'll get through as many as

994
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,680
we can and then we'll stop so

995
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:55,119
all right so this one again there's two

996
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,200
issues that have to do with cipher

997
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,960
suites okay so what the draft does right

998
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,799
now is it defines two cipher suite

999
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,640
values you can see there

1000
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,839
kind of defines like an iona registry

1001
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,118
and there's two values out of there

1002
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:06,799
defined right now

1003
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,800
and the messages you can see the

1004
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,839
supported cypher suites is an

1005
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,520
array of sweet values and

1006
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,839
so that's what the tam sends and then

1007
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,520
the agent sends back a selected one

1008
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,759
which is a single one

1009
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,440
and then the combined cdl you see this

1010
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,000
cypher sweets as

1011
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,920
bitmaps okay well you've got this array

1012
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,119
of sweet values that looks like a typo

1013
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,680
so that's what 72

1014
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,280
is is why does that say as bitmaps we

1015
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
think that you just say cipher sweets

1016
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,320
and bleep those two words so that's

1017
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,400
issue 72

1018
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
73 which i think is just trivial

1019
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,079
editorial so

1020
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,359
73 on the other hand is you've got two

1021
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,839
different values defined

1022
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,440
right if your tam only supports value

1023
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,160
one your agent only supports value two

1024
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,160
or vice versa

1025
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,799
you don't have interoperability so the

1026
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,078
question is what cipher suite or suites

1027
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,119
are mandatory to implement

1028
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,640
on each end that's what 73 is i don't

1029
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,640
know what the recommendation is there

1030
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,160
but i would defer to any crypto people

1031
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,440
here if they have a recommendation

1032
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,839
sure what should be mandatory to

1033
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,839
implement

1034
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,680
i'm looking for somebody just hand me

1035
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,160
the answer because i don't know enough

1036
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,759
to know

1037
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,759
where what should be mandatory here so

1038
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,440
so i don't know if ben or somebody if

1039
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,440
you have a recommendation

1040
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,240
so jumping in this is ben k duck we tend

1041
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
to prefer

1042
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,040
the x25509 and

1043
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,800
dsa of de novo

1044
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,160
deployments where you don't have any

1045
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,960
legacy considerations to

1046
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,560
to work with uh but we tend to have to

1047
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,839
fall back to p256

1048
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,720
and es256 for cases where you have like

1049
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,839
a tpm or a smart card that can only do

1050
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
the older algorithms

1051
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,079
so i'm interpreting that as saying it

1052
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
you kind of have to support two for

1053
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,119
legacy purposes but you want to move to

1054
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,839
number one

1055
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,599
and so maybe number two is mandatory

1056
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,440
number one is encouraged and will become

1057
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,040
mandatory in the future is that

1058
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,119
how you phrase it or that i think

1059
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,160
could be the case i don't have a great

1060
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,760
picture of myself

1061
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,319
of what the deployed hardware it

1062
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,119
currently is so what if we said that

1063
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,720
both of them are mandatory on the tam

1064
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,920
and the agent can choose either one of

1065
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,919
them that would be another approach

1066
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,960
right so you can i mean there's multiple

1067
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,480
ways to get interoperability right you

1068
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,760
can either pick one and say both ends

1069
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,359
have to do that one and could choose to

1070
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,839
negotiate something else or you can say

1071
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,240
that

1072
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,839
one end has to do all of the set and the

1073
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,720
other end can choose which one it wants

1074
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,880
and so

1075
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,160
if you think about uh tp agents that are

1076
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,800
in constrained devices

1077
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,200
then maybe mandating too or you want the

1078
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
one that's best for a small iot device

1079
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,000
or something like that so we could take

1080
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,560
an approach that says

1081
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,480
tams must support both and tp agents can

1082
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,799
pick either one of those two

1083
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,319
ming i see you you're in queue i said

1084
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,920
ben did you have any

1085
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,319
thing there before yes real quick the

1086
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,119
make the tam support both of them is

1087
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,279
perhaps the

1088
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,400
more forward-looking option that i want

1089
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,760
to hear what maggie says

1090
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,480
as well okay yeah so just fyi

1091
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
russ put on the chat that he has a minor

1092
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,839
preference for two

1093
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,640
for the same reason ben stated

1094
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,520
yep okay i see a couple plus ones for

1095
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,799
both on tam

1096
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,839
and okay right um

1097
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,760
ning oh yeah i can speak

1098
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,640
okay so just what uh comment

1099
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,800
on what you said there was in our old

1100
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,000
protocol we already have say

1101
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,480
time supported mandatory support both

1102
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,440
and agents support one for them so i

1103
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,560
will support that

1104
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,640
position so that has to be the case

1105
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,799
i don't need to support all i don't want

1106
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,598
to pose this comment on that

1107
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,880
okay sounds like we actually have uh i

1108
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
don't hear anybody arguing for something

1109
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,079
else so

1110
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,960
uh as an author i will accept that as

1111
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,480
being direction of the authors so

1112
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,400
next slide

1113
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,839
i just want to make sure td captures

1114
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,359
that on the notes too

1115
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,160
yeah um okay so

1116
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,520
here there is this uh thread that was

1117
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,078
joint rats and teeth

1118
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,800
with the title each claims needed by t

1119
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,680
right

1120
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,680
this one is still open um where the

1121
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,200
architecture document says here's some

1122
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,759
things you have to be able to express

1123
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,279
in claims somehow and doesn't say how

1124
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,839
that leaves it to you know something

1125
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,520
it's a

1126
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,119
normative spec you know a protocol spec

1127
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,480
or something to say so we have to be

1128
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,599
able to say it right and so if you go

1129
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,119
down that list

1130
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,040
that thread enumerates a couple of the

1131
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,640
requirements and some of them have

1132
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,119
claims they're already there

1133
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
and uh lauren said respondents saying

1134
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,240
yep we need a new claim yep we need to

1135
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,599
claim and

1136
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,118
in rats uh yesterday or whatever um

1137
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,480
lawrence mentioned that they're still

1138
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,079
working on they have pull requests and

1139
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,680
stuff in progress

1140
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,640
and so uh because of that my summary is

1141
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,200
that uh we that the proposal at least i

1142
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,000
think from

1143
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,200
lawrence and myself is that um we should

1144
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,680
not define

1145
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,200
yet and let tell proven otherwise any

1146
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,078
type specific claims

1147
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,240
right lawrence's belief and i agree is

1148
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,400
that everything in this list is things

1149
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,720
that would be applicable outside of teep

1150
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,319
and so would go into the eat spec or

1151
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,399
something in the rats working group

1152
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,160
and we can just refer to it and so some

1153
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,839
of them are there now some of them are

1154
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,960
not

1155
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,119
um but um and in

1156
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,119
rats lawrence mentioned that for

1157
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,960
firmware and software identifiers right

1158
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,880
he says the intent for

1159
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,400
software claims to use coswood and this

1160
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,200
is on a slide in the rats you're working

1161
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,240
group

1162
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,598
um and but there's nothing in the eat

1163
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,319
document about coswoods

1164
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
yet okay so i think i'll mention that in

1165
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,040
the

1166
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
next slide or two slides if i get to it

1167
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,400
so we'll come back to that but here

1168
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,400
i think there's nothing for us to do yet

1169
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,599
right now i'm just reporting out that's

1170
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,720
what i saw on the thread so next slide

1171
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,839
unless i see anybody in queue okay

1172
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,000
no how does just a glue on your okay so

1173
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,960
yeah coming now drilling down to this

1174
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,839
causewood stuff

1175
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,319
okay so what we need in teep is we need

1176
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,560
a

1177
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,400
version independent id and by version

1178
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,240
independent i mean you know as you

1179
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,160
rev your suit manifest with you know

1180
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,520
patches and so on you increase your

1181
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,560
manifest sequence number you're going to

1182
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,560
increase your

1183
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,240
uh component id sequence and your

1184
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,759
version number and so on but version

1185
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,799
independent identifier

1186
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
that we can use in messages and abstract

1187
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,359
apis like request ta

1188
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,880
so what appears in your delete message

1189
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,240
and so on okay

1190
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,760
well the suit manifest has a digest id

1191
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,919
but that one's version specific

1192
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,400
brendan may be correcting me here and it

1193
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,280
says that coswood is optional

1194
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,960
the coswood spec has this tag id that

1195
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,040
says it's a 16 byte

1196
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,640
uniquely identif uniquely referencing a

1197
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,839
software component

1198
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,680
so to my uh unknowledgeable eyes

1199
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,359
that tag id looks like it would meet the

1200
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,399
requirement

1201
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,680
but it's optional in suit and so one

1202
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,599
thing we could do is to say

1203
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,839
suit manifest carried in teep for this

1204
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,040
purposes need to use the coswood

1205
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,200
but this is the other one that i needed

1206
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,920
brendan here and so uh brendan please

1207
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,279
correct what i'm

1208
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,280
what any misunderstandings i have

1209
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,279
from previous discussions was that we

1210
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,599
were planning to use

1211
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,200
the component identifier in the suit

1212
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,200
manifest for this kind of purpose

1213
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,720
so or at least some portion of it if you

1214
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,720
have something that's

1215
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,078
great i think when i had asked about a

1216
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,598
component identifier

1217
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,119
in some message maybe you i don't

1218
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,319
remember which message it was

1219
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,079
i didn't see anything in the suit

1220
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,079
manifest document right now that was

1221
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,440
directly usable other than causewiz so

1222
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,760
please correct me if there is something

1223
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,880
that's version independent id

1224
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,920
so what you have in uh in suit

1225
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,920
for purposes like this is

1226
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,760
the component identifier and the way

1227
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,920
that it works is it's an array

1228
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,960
of uh byte strings so that you can

1229
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,680
represent a notional path so when we

1230
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,400
talked about

1231
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,919
trusted domains previously the idea was

1232
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,880
that we were going to have

1233
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,240
a te identifier followed by a trusted

1234
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,520
domain identifier

1235
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,040
followed by a vendor identifier or maybe

1236
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,000
i've got those two in the wrong order

1237
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,200
not important um and then followed by

1238
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,640
some kind of

1239
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,439
ta identifier so it seems to me like

1240
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,040
that's probably the same use cases we're

1241
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,119
describing here

1242
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,400
okay so if you think that that's what we

1243
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,680
should be using

1244
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,200
um then i am happy to uh you know

1245
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,480
generate a pull request that points to

1246
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,078
things as long as you tell me what the

1247
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,960
right term to use is and we can do that

1248
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,480
offline

1249
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,800
then that sounds like that would be my

1250
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
inclination um if there's a good reason

1251
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,839
not to take that approach we talked

1252
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,118
about using uuids

1253
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,839
for tas as well so i'm not entirely sure

1254
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,880
whether you're

1255
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,759
looking for a uuid here or not um just

1256
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,680
has to be unique

1257
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,160
right because in the component id you're

1258
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,118
saying the last component of the uid

1259
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,960
array could be

1260
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,240
a uuid right it's just arbitrary for

1261
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,359
example

1262
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,879
yeah yeah okay i think yeah that your

1263
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,799
proposal sounds fine to me unless

1264
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,359
anybody else has anything i see hana has

1265
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,680
gotten q

1266
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,400
this total makes sense to me um i was

1267
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,440
just wondering

1268
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,160
uh maybe you can explain uh

1269
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,640
what the idea of the cost suite would be

1270
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,240
here

1271
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,160
um i'm not not too familiar with or not

1272
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,359
enough familiar with coursework to say

1273
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,799
like whether this would

1274
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,960
uh how this actually relates

1275
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
um it's just something that can uniquely

1276
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,839
identify

1277
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,440
a software component right i mean the

1278
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,880
tag id is

1279
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,720
something that's just 16 by that's

1280
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,839
already an existing

1281
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,160
um thing that's neither rats nor suit

1282
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,078
nor

1283
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,078
teep specific right it's from saccum

1284
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,200
it's not an rfc yet it's an active draft

1285
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,280
right

1286
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,480
okay but if we for example as brenton

1287
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,400
said if we put

1288
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,640
use the component id from the suit

1289
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,119
manifest and put

1290
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,799
use that and maybe that contains a uid

1291
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,280
uh in in our case that

1292
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,160
we can mandate that uh that should be

1293
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,280
fine yeah

1294
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,160
yeah i agree then we should be fine

1295
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,920
okay um i think i may have time for one

1296
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,319
more slide if i got two minutes we'll

1297
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,359
see

1298
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:19,520
so let's go one more slide and

1299
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:23,040
cut me off in two minutes okay

1300
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,720
um okay so this one

1301
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,880
was an issue that's been going back and

1302
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,598
forth between hanus and me and i forget

1303
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,440
who else

1304
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,720
might have commented on that thing but

1305
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,480
it's been on the issue not on the list

1306
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,879
so this is to raise visibility here

1307
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,559
and to get more inputs here uh not

1308
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,839
necessarily in the next few minutes but

1309
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,520
um at least to tell you to um things and

1310
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,200
so here

1311
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,119
we have suit manifest that can depend on

1312
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,439
other suit manifests

1313
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,040
the things it depends on might be even

1314
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,480
having to come from a different tam

1315
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,880
right there's a case that we talked

1316
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,160
about

1317
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,480
in the context of the architecture

1318
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,000
document where you have personalization

1319
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,960
data that might need to come from a

1320
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,800
different tam

1321
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,000
than the ta binary that's one of the use

1322
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,200
cases we talked about

1323
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,640
um you know uh last year sometime

1324
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,598
and so let's assume that you have a

1325
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,440
dependency from suit manifest a

1326
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,200
on to suit manifest b that has to come

1327
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,559
from a different tam right there's a

1328
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,078
special case where it can be the same

1329
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,760
tam and that's the one where we started

1330
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,119
off honestly discussing

1331
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,079
but this is just a generalized thing we

1332
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,359
actually have the same problem when

1333
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
there's two different tams involved you

1334
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,520
know a depends on b

1335
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,800
so there's at least four options here

1336
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,599
and maybe different people have

1337
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,040
different preferences here

1338
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,880
and it's also possible they're gonna be

1339
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,720
multiple correct answers and so

1340
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,800
option number one is to say well the tam

1341
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,720
has to resolve all the dependencies

1342
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,720
and then pushes down the blob of all the

1343
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,558
suit manifest down to the agent in one

1344
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,558
install message well

1345
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:43,599
that's problematic if there's a case i

1346
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,280
think anyway

1347
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,119
if the dependency is personalization

1348
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,880
data that the tam is not allowed to see

1349
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,000
it just sounds pretty complex but you

1350
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,040
know maybe you can find a way to make it

1351
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,280
work

1352
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,800
number two is the same thing as number

1353
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,480
one except for now there's a separate

1354
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,280
install message right there's an install

1355
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,200
message

1356
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,319
that might have a dependency on

1357
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,759
something that comes in another install

1358
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,800
message

1359
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,280
option number three is to say that the

1360
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,440
suits

1361
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,880
the agent suit processor is responsible

1362
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,240
for resolving the dependencies so that

1363
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,720
him doesn't have to do anything it's the

1364
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,279
job of the agent or the suit processor

1365
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,640
and now how does that relate to in into

1366
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,040
install messages

1367
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,720
well you could uh just not respond to

1368
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,160
the first install message until all the

1369
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,759
dependencies are resolved and suit

1370
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,319
processing completes but maybe that'll

1371
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,319
take a

1372
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,839
bunch of time so what does the tame do

1373
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,319
in the meantime

1374
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:31,839
and option number four is the agent

1375
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,240
resolves those dependencies but

1376
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,200
sends back some progress notification of

1377
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,479
the tab

1378
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,799
maybe there's other options but those

1379
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,440
the four and i think i am out of time

1380
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,880
now and so my preferences aren't three

1381
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,880
but i'm going to seed time so

1382
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,040
okay if it's worthwhile you can take it

1383
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,200
to the list

1384
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,240
i would love to hear pick comments from

1385
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,879
other people in the working group

1386
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,839
besides

1387
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,559
me and hannah so yes please come into

1388
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:01,920
the list but

1389
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,440
let's go to akira yeah

1390
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,640
okay akira hi

1391
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,319
oh is my mic working now yes okay

1392
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:16,640
great perfect yes

1393
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,640
um yes next slide please

1394
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,240
yes um i'm going to talk something

1395
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,680
first which is not written in this slide

1396
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,558
so what really happened during the

1397
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,558
hackathon week

1398
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,439
initially my plan was there was many

1399
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:39,599
update for the xero4 draft in the deep

1400
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,559
protocol so up catch up with the latest

1401
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,880
draft with

1402
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:44,000
on monday and tuesday and then

1403
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,040
announcing about

1404
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,880
wednesday when we all get together with

1405
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,240
uh do the uh

1406
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,960
connecting individual time and time

1407
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,680
server um tama time server and deep

1408
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,920
device

1409
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,520
but what really happened was we were

1410
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,240
busy in internal

1411
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,440
updating in implementation of deep

1412
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,479
device

1413
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,760
to adopt the therefore draft

1414
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,960
until thursday night or something

1415
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,680
so what really happened was having a

1416
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,599
discussion meeting on friday and that's

1417
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,160
the photo during the hackathon

1418
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,520
agenda in this slide so that's the

1419
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,879
reality but um

1420
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,599
we got many things um uh

1421
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,880
raised i mean not raised but to find

1422
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:34,240
improve the

1423
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,559
draft so yeah that's wait

1424
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,879
and that's the from the next slide next

1425
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,880
please

1426
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,000
oh yes that was this is the picture from

1427
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,119
the

1428
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,680
on friday yes

1429
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,680
next please

1430
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:58,160
and yes these are the implementation we

1431
00:52:54,319 --> 00:53:02,000
at the moment we know on on

1432
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:05,118
friday so i i know that uh

1433
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,440
harness and and ming we might also have

1434
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,640
the

1435
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,640
implementation but yes and next slide

1436
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:16,640
please

1437
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,520
and these are the details but most of

1438
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,879
the details

1439
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,079
listed here is overlap what about what

1440
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,520
um dave have presented before and it's

1441
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,839
related with the most of it

1442
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:33,200
is token and and another

1443
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:35,040
another two topics of how to consider a

1444
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,520
consideration of the token and the

1445
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:41,040
second is the detail

1446
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:43,759
t protocol message compatibility

1447
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,960
and detail compatibility is we could

1448
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,680
something we could uh

1449
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,720
improve with with a github issue and

1450
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,598
pull requests and

1451
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,399
um merging it however the discussion of

1452
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,359
the token

1453
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,720
it was a bit more serious and from the

1454
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,759
hackathon

1455
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,640
implementing perspective of the token

1456
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,119
discussion

1457
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,520
is oneness we need

1458
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,400
is that token need to be mandatory or

1459
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,640
option

1460
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,680
and and uh but most importantly from the

1461
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,799
implementing

1462
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,000
on the tip device and time is how to

1463
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,040
generate the token

1464
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,240
which will not likely to collide between

1465
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,759
the different time

1466
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:29,680
so everything i think we need

1467
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:32,240
uh some guidance in the uh the draft

1468
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,000
how to generate the token and then

1469
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,959
another thing is

1470
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
in the implementation of the tipped

1471
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,880
install

1472
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,119
which is just sending the binary from

1473
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,760
tam server to the device

1474
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,280
we need some kind of id and so right now

1475
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:50,960
the ta

1476
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,720
name change the tc so tc unique id

1477
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,599
and if we not explicitly written in this

1478
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,480
draft we might end up somebody in the

1479
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,760
implement

1480
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,040
implementer using token in

1481
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,440
for the tc id unique id which is not a

1482
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,960
good

1483
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,760
uh practice so i think we we we have we

1484
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,839
we did have

1485
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,040
we were discussing what what is the

1486
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:16,319
unique id

1487
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,759
really going to be used and

1488
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:22,880
and uh on the fridays

1489
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,760
dcid what going to be a tc

1490
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,319
unique id is something we need it's not

1491
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,319
uh

1492
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,079
we don't we not really don't have it

1493
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,599
right now but probably it's going to be

1494
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,839
a tc list or in this

1495
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,839
um suit manifest

1496
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,640
so and another discussion was

1497
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,160
right now we were all busy just

1498
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,240
supporting seaboard

1499
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,598
and the keep seaboard present a

1500
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,759
representation

1501
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,520
for the binary was keep the updating

1502
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,520
where we were just

1503
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,520
following the update was it end up

1504
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,520
our work but in the next next step will

1505
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,558
be

1506
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,599
supporting coset and then we really need

1507
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,720
which uh cypher suit should we need to

1508
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,359
implement

1509
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,720
for the at least for the hackathon or

1510
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,319
interpret the

1511
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,160
test between the time server and deep

1512
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:16,799
device and that's something

1513
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,520
i saw the discussion in the dave's slot

1514
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:20,799
so

1515
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:24,079
i said i see okay and next

1516
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:24,079
page please

1517
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:37,520
yes um yeah these are almost uh

1518
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:41,520
related to the token or tip

1519
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:46,559
tip message details of the binary format

1520
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:49,119
or not notation uh representation

1521
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,920
and one thing improvement is we have we

1522
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,680
didn't have a

1523
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,640
time but um we we now have the unneeded

1524
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,319
ta list

1525
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,640
so we could use that for the um removing

1526
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:03,119
the ins the binary inside the chip

1527
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,118
device

1528
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:12,799
yes and next space please

1529
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:15,680
so kerry you have three minutes left

1530
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,680
and uh

1531
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:26,000
yes um this is the pull request

1532
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:29,280
still which is open um which is the uh

1533
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,559
yes um make making the

1534
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,520
tc list as a mandatory which which is

1535
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,040
not that

1536
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,240
um significant in the changes in the

1537
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:41,119
draft but um it's

1538
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:44,160
it's it's needed to update okay in the

1539
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,160
next page please

1540
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,920
and these are the some of the changes we

1541
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,200
were able to

1542
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:55,119
um close during the the week at the

1543
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:58,558
hackathon

1544
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,680
it's most of them are just

1545
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:06,240
binary format compatibility

1546
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:10,319
yes okay

1547
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,319
and next page please

1548
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:23,200
yes so this is what we learned so mostly

1549
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,359
we it's going to repeat the same thing

1550
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:30,879
token consideration what and also the id

1551
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:33,759
consideration and binary

1552
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,920
compatibility consideration and that and

1553
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,040
binary compatibility representation is

1554
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,040
going to be

1555
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,400
probably okay with the just up keep

1556
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,710
updating with the

1557
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:47,110
git issue and pull requests and github

1558
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:47,110
[Music]

1559
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,720
and i think that's all the next page

1560
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,040
please

1561
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,919
yes and these are the people who was in

1562
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:02,160
the hackathon

1563
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:05,119
okay any question i think it's about

1564
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,200
one or one minute left or something yeah

1565
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,280
dave's in the queue

1566
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,640
uh so accurate there was one thing and i

1567
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,400
don't remember which issue if you can

1568
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,920
point people to it it was the

1569
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,599
one where we had the discussion about

1570
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,000
the uh

1571
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,160
the integer field at the end and being

1572
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,720
able to combine stuff into the star ant

1573
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,240
and stuff

1574
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,160
which which issue number was that

1575
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:28,240
remember that issue number

1576
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,558
78 okay so that was good

1577
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,078
token if we make the token optional for

1578
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,480
that discussion uh

1579
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,720
see issue number 78 it sounds like okay

1580
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,119
thanks

1581
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,439
i think it's in the page slide number

1582
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,440
page

1583
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:47,839
page page six yes

1584
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,240
so we might we have to change the tip

1585
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,759
message framework

1586
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:58,399
from the beginning to uh making which

1587
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,040
which which member entry going to the

1588
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,280
option and

1589
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,400
it and enter is going to be up uh

1590
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,400
mandatory and up soon

1591
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,160
yes okay

1592
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,680
well i'm glad you guys were doing this

1593
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,839
because you're shaking out some of the

1594
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,839
issues

1595
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,319
both on on the document and and the flow

1596
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,319
which is good

1597
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:27,119
um with that we're out of time um

1598
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,000
so dave do you want me to put out a

1599
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,200
doodle poll

1600
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:35,040
for a virtual

1601
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,960
progress on the protocol

1602
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,119
yeah i think there is still more stuff

1603
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,520
to discuss that i didn't present

1604
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,960
i mean and i only picked a subset of the

1605
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,040
issues that i thought were the bigger

1606
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,880
architectural issues of the protocol so

1607
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,319
i'm sure we have at least another hour

1608
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,640
of discussion so

1609
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,520
so i was asking is there like use the

1610
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,759
cancelled uh

1611
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,839
rat slot for a side meeting or a

1612
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,599
schedule of virtual interim afterwards

1613
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:00,720
anything like that so yeah please

1614
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:03,119
whatever we can do well since

1615
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,839
since everyone's on the call and and ben

1616
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:07,040
our ad

1617
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:10,880
is here ben i just sent the cancellation

1618
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,880
i did notify the secretariat

1619
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:19,279
rats was scheduled to meet tomorrow

1620
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:22,720
and the third session the 4 to 6 pm

1621
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:27,920
bangkok time ict time can we use

1622
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,919
that slot are we too late

1623
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:35,599
as an intern or side meeting

1624
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:37,200
uh i mean i think if we wanted to have a

1625
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:39,280
bunch of people get together

1626
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,879
and and have a side meeting in that slot

1627
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:44,079
that would be great

1628
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:46,880
i don't really expect us to be able to

1629
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,920
sort of turn it into an official 2

1630
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,640
second session

1631
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,960
or something like that i don't know that

1632
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,879
we need to um

1633
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:57,119
i mean and i don't want to lose the

1634
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:00,400
momentum so

1635
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:03,440
will um are folks okay having a

1636
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,880
i should we call it a side meeting then

1637
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,440
um yeah a side meeting or

1638
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,640
a working session or something yeah i

1639
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,680
think we would have to use

1640
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:20,240
uh webex to answer dave's question

1641
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:23,598
ah okay well i can set one up

1642
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,439
russ you were saying something i was

1643
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,440
just going to say the medico was gone

1644
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:35,839
ah my bad

1645
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,839
okay so um

1646
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:41,680
i guess i will try and do a quick show

1647
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,920
of hands

1648
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,839
