21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,400
for a moment i forgot to plug it in and

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,599
the battery ran out just like a minute

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
ago so

24
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,879
that's why i got disconnected

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
anyways is the audio okay or yeah that

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,319
works fine

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,238
uh we got christian offering to help

28
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,119
taking minutes but he's also going to

29
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,599
present

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,560
a few things so one more minute taker

31
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,560
would be good for today

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,839
anything anyone that wants to help

33
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,679
and still i mean it might be that we

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
don't need to start right away we still

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,440
have a couple of minutes maybe

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,399
or one or two minutes more in case some

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
more people join

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,280
yeah i'll see everybody yet

39
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
um as usual uh if possible marco or i

40
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
would help with the minutes but we need

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:33,839
i will we really do need one more

42
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,840
because it becomes too cumbersome

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
should we volunteer people at random

44
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,920
maybe we need a taco feature like

45
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
congratulations you have been selected

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,480
that w3c has w3c

47
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,280
has a robot called zakim that they use

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,040
on their irc chats

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,319
and one of the things you can do is ask

50
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,679
zakim to randomly pick a

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,519
scribe and it remembers who was the

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
scribe in your working group

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,880
previously and tries not to pick the

54
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:29,759
same person every time

55
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:32,320
that's a nice feeling i like it

56
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,520
um doing some sort of humming uh which

99
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,720
is the show of hands which maybe we will

100
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,758
use

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,800
um for queuing as usual just type

102
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
make a column and ask and

103
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
and so on and the meeting will be

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
recorded and as i said the blue sheets

105
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,720
already

106
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,880
automatically filled so for today's

107
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,919
this is the agenda we will start with rd

108
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,280
and stateless and

109
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,639
few other material graphs the drafts and

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
then move to group com

111
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,160
and oscore and friday

112
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,000
well friday will be whatever is left

113
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
from from this time as you can see we

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
have

115
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
two hours each time so probably there

116
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,359
won't be

117
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,840
anything left out and

118
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:59,840
i think i think we have plenty of time

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,840
so time for agenda bashing

120
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,720
all right so uh

121
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
some of the documents so rd as if you

122
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
have been in the interims you you have

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,440
seen that we have done a lot of progress

124
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
and at this point uh well christian we

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
will give an update

126
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,878
um but essentially it's on the ad table

127
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
all of the isg comments were addressed

128
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,080
and um

129
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,759
i have to finish the write up i will

130
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,000
take some notes from from this session

131
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,759
but

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,958
after that then we are done on stateless

133
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
um similar situation uh pretty much an

134
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,439
80 follow-up

135
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,919
and we will have the presentation by

136
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,919
michael

137
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,199
the vrn we've had some uh updates

138
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
uh by jari and i think also pretty much

139
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
ready

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,680
and similarly with the core request

141
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,599
stack so we have quite quite good

142
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,359
progress i think

143
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,120
we can accomplish i mean this can be

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,040
done very quickly

145
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,640
um and let's see let's see how the

146
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,760
session uh develops for

147
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,439
for the first two then uh

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,360
on post working group last call so we

149
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
are awaiting the write up

150
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,000
on on the core conf cluster

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,320
and yeah that's essentially the status i

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
believe

153
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,279
and then for oscor

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
group com so the working glass call has

155
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,160
concluded and

156
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,160
the comments were processed um

157
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,439
i believe the marco correct me if i'm

158
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
wrong like we needed a few more

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
reviewers

160
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,640
or whatever you came during the

161
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,880
hackathon from christian

162
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
so next step is to process that review

163
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
and well i have an update in the

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
presentation later

165
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
perfect

166
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,519
so that's it without further ado i guess

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,320
we can start with rd

168
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,200
which is resource directory christian

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,800
are you

170
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,760
ready yes okay just a second then i am

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,519
not ready

172
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,519
i'll remove my video sorry

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
so um this is hopefully one of the later

174
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,719
updates of

175
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,000
resource directory next slide please

176
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,760
um we've published a dash um

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,320
26 just before the cutoff which

178
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
managed which includes all the changes

179
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,040
that were necessary

180
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,440
due to the iesg review i won't go

181
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
through

182
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,120
all of them here because there is a

183
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
detailed changelog and

184
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,800
if you have anything particular then

185
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,160
please look it up there

186
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
how about there's four things that i'd

187
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,719
like to point out first is that a new

188
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,680
section was added a new uh basically

189
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,800
security policy was added for previously

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,959
this only

191
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,880
outlined however security policy means

192
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,640
what a security policy could do and now

193
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,480
we have a concrete example

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,079
which may be chosen by implementations

195
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,720
as a default policy if you have

196
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,399
something that's kind of

197
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,720
install and run that this is something

198
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,399
that it can do

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
there was a lot of clarification around

200
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,480
the discovery process which

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
now says more explicitly that this the

202
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,279
host discoveries itself which of

203
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
course from things like dhcp options etc

204
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,079
um

205
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
is not particularly relied on in terms

206
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,719
of security

207
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,480
or the path discovery is if there are um

208
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,720
in in particular cases um

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
one change that might come as a surprise

210
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,279
for implementers is that we found out

211
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,360
that

212
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,439
that basically we didn't think of

213
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
whether it's a good idea to use the

214
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
well-known core resource

215
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,519
just post um simple registrations there

216
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,279
as well

217
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,440
it turned out there's no really good

218
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,040
reason to answer that um

219
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,959
that question that came about that so it

220
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
was actually changed to a new

221
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
um to a new well-known resort to be

222
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,920
registered resource

223
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,440
and a lot of the examples had um our

224
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,199
resource type values that were based

225
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,839
in um in the core interfaces draft

226
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
which is not active enough to really

227
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,279
warrant

228
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,279
having using registered values there

229
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
that are not actually registered

230
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,920
so um that was changed in favor of

231
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,279
of short your eyes and

232
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,439
one more change you might have seen in

233
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,839
the last document um

234
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,560
thanks to the other authors um for

235
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,079
offering me

236
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,000
to kind of shuffle to the top position

237
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,839
of the offices

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,800
um so this all the next slide please

239
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
um there were a few questions that we

240
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,000
did address as the

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,000
questions themselves but there was

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,760
follow-up work to do

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
there's still follow-up work to do that

244
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,399
has not wound up in the document yet

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
and there's roughly three topics around

246
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,959
this first

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,079
is the the topic of dtls replays so the

248
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,199
original comment here was that um we're

249
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,439
using ptls like

250
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
tls so it might be a good idea to to

251
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,040
enable replay protection

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,440
but really the same thing so the the one

253
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,639
thing

254
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,639
where replays can be problematic is

255
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,079
where the

256
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,160
is is not immediately mitigated by

257
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
by turning on replay protection so if

258
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,040
even if we turn on liquid protection it

259
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,160
would still be possible to exploit

260
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,079
something like

261
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,160
um a device registering and

262
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,279
deregistering repeatedly

263
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,120
and then injecting a message in which

264
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,760
the devices

265
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,959
the device's registration is deleted um

266
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
without

267
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,199
the device i actually haven't authorized

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
this next slide base

269
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,760
so there is a work in progress text to

270
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,160
mitigate that we've also talked about

271
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
this

272
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,760
and other ways of doing it and

273
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,399
alternative methods uh during the

274
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,199
interims

275
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,680
um this just basically needs to be

276
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,000
finished in terms of text and then

277
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,800
get a few pairs of eyes from the working

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,079
group

279
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
and wind up in the dash 27 it's using

280
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,880
the

281
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,000
icon mechanism from echo request tag

282
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,760
which is also

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,199
used in other parts of the document

284
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,800
already so we're not

285
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,719
bringing in anything conceptually new

286
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,560
we're just referring to

287
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
a mechanism that's specified somewhere

288
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,119
else

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,120
next slide please another question that

290
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160
came up was um how much can you trust

291
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,079
the links from the

292
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,199
resource directory and there's a simple

293
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,599
answer that is

294
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,800
um that the security policies tell you

295
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,320
that

296
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,839
but from the white space of the on the

297
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,959
bottom of the slide you can tell that

298
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,000
this is not all of it

299
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,518
next slide please so um

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,600
a device uses the authorizations

301
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
it has to create a request then it has

302
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,680
an intention

303
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,519
it phrases this into a request and that

304
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,839
request then has other side effect which

305
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,079
gives it the response

306
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,959
slightly in concrete this might mean

307
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,479
that a device wants to create a topic

308
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,079
and then discovering a property of a

309
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,800
particular resource um

310
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,638
phrases this into a request let's say a

311
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
post request to slash topics

312
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,800
another topic that's created and while

313
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,839
the process between

314
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,199
the request and the action is well

315
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,040
protected

316
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,439
we don't really have much in terms of

317
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,360
how does the device how can we how can

318
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,360
the server be sure that what the client

319
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:22,320
intended is what the client

320
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,040
put into its request next slide please

321
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
so in terms of the resource directory i

322
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
don't think

323
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
we have anything much more to do so we

324
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,240
already stated in earlier versions that

325
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,680
this is something to take care about

326
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,199
when thinking of application of

327
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,839
into of the integration between the

328
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
resource tracking and the security

329
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,639
policies

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
um due to the latest changes we now also

331
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,000
follow that same advice when it comes to

332
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,000
how the resource directory is discovered

333
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,120
but we should probably have some more

334
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,199
discussion on on how this was mitigated

335
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,160
in the general case so one way of doing

336
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
it is

337
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,600
saying that a server should really only

338
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
use one

339
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
have one function this is something like

340
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,800
that in oauth

341
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
but that means we've got a lot of

342
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
security context this could mean that we

343
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,920
introduce

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
a way of verifying statements the

345
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,519
resource directory this would all or

346
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,599
any other means of discovery the

347
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,399
resource directory is a cache and same

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
applies for

349
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,920
multicast responses and so on

350
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,319
and possibly also to talk in a more

351
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,920
fine-grained way about the permission

352
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
about the roles that a

353
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,079
server might do serving which is

354
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
probably a topic for

355
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,160
for ace but this is something i'd like

356
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,839
to have more discussion on

357
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,639
in the general core context

358
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
next slide please and the third upcoming

359
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,440
change for dash 27 is the topic of

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,839
um examples and the link format

361
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,759
representation

362
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,320
again um so

363
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
we are doing two things with respect to

364
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,440
rfc 6690

365
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
link format that is one um we described

366
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
that

367
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,559
there is a subset that we think that

368
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,799
everyone who's implemented it can

369
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,240
can actually work with because there is

370
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,480
there's a few

371
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,000
um bits of misalignment between the

372
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,000
actual implementations that

373
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,520
also stems from ambiguity in the

374
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,640
original document

375
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,439
and the other thing is that we prescribe

376
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,480
that both

377
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
um both the link target and the anchor

378
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,959
need to be fully expanded on the next

379
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,039
slide please

380
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,679
thing is um the kind of the the um

381
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,280
the the reading of the duck of 6690 that

382
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,559
caused the most trouble and the most

383
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,399
overhead in terms of

384
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,440
bites on the wire um was my reading

385
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,799
and in the discussion i think that from

386
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
the discussion i take it that this

387
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,039
reading was wrong

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,880
and that we can simplify what we send on

389
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,640
the wire a lot

390
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,919
like actor f2 in many cases

391
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,320
um and so pending a check of the other

392
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,640
implementations which i've reviewed but

393
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
two years ago which i need to go over

394
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
again

395
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,600
this could still be changed to not

396
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,080
prescribed that the anchor must be there

397
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,280
unconditionally but give a

398
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,639
still simple but way sharper rule about

399
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,039
when it needs to be there

400
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,559
and update the examples accordingly next

401
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,919
slide guys

402
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,360
so that's the three things that still

403
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,520
should probably change um in a follow-up

404
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,799
document so the mail to the reviews all

405
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,918
so indicated that this is addressing the

406
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,840
their concerns as they were phrased but

407
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,520
those questions raised more questions

408
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
and they will be answered in the dash 27

409
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,039
on

410
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,240
how to have this in a submittable state

411
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,720
around the start of december questions

412
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
comments

413
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,840
do you still hear me

414
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
yep yes

415
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,840
this is barry aliba i saw that you when

416
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,439
you posted 26

417
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,159
you um sent a note to the

418
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,799
uh to the three ads who have discusses

419
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,360
on

420
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,120
the resource directory document uh and

421
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,719
they haven't responded yet which is now

422
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
about two weeks ago

423
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
it would be good to follow up on that

424
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,559
and uh

425
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
make sure it doesn't get lost um i'm

426
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
sure they were busy

427
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,039
leading up to the meeting so maybe in

428
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,840
another week

429
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,480
ping them again and remind them

430
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,120
so i got one i didn't keep track of who

431
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,760
sent that

432
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,080
exactly um i got one mail about the

433
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,760
ballot that's about to be cleared

434
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,260
um but i'll follow up with the others

435
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,640
thank you i think that was ben

436
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,559
[Music]

437
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,160
i think the two eric's still need to be

438
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,320
uh

439
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,480
anyway i'm just saying uh just remember

440
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,200
to follow up on it and don't uh

441
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,840
don't let me drag it because uh and we

442
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
get busy and we forget

443
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,840
so

444
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,840
christian i don't know francesco stepped

445
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
into the queue here

446
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
otherwise my question is

447
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,000
um i haven't i haven't followed the

448
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,960
details

449
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,240
this protecting the intention what how

450
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,880
can you

451
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,960
can you elaborate a little bit on that

452
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,919
so the thing is um

453
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,559
the the client has something in in mind

454
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
when it

455
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,840
wants to send a request and it's using

456
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,799
material

457
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,000
that it has around about the server so

458
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,879
that might be

459
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,480
that might be a link that might be um

460
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,280
attributes on a link

461
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,039
that might even be a form that might be

462
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,918
something that it got from uh

463
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,280
from a 401 um you'll need to register

464
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,960
with that es

465
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,440
um response and

466
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,320
not all of that information the client

467
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,919
will have

468
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,120
with uh with another from a source that

469
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,400
it can trust as

470
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,799
much as it can trust the origin server

471
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,120
and assembling that information into

472
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,879
requests means that

473
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,120
if that information is grossly

474
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,960
misleading the request might be

475
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,320
not what the client intended but will

476
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,760
still be executed with

477
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,840
whatever credentials the client has so

478
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:42,720
um if say you're trying to

479
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,720
create a topic and you're discovering

480
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,959
from from for example from a resource

481
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
directory that there is

482
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,039
a resource with that property that

483
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,360
indicates that you can just post there

484
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,720
and then a topic gets created

485
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,600
then if if that information is wrong for

486
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
example if

487
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
if actually on that resource there is a

488
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,559
thing that says

489
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,760
um please do you ask me in a

490
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,000
very blunt example then the client

491
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,240
would authorize that action believing

492
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,360
that it means something different

493
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,039
and this intention is not trans is not

494
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,678
part of what we

495
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,240
what we authenticate in the in the even

496
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,760
with the

497
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,320
request response violence that we have

498
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,320
in our school

499
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
so um thanks but i think that that that

500
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,520
makes sense

501
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,158
that that was sort of my understanding

502
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
when you

503
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,360
uh presented it in in more detail what

504
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,600
my problem is what what do you plan to

505
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,678
do about it how can you

506
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,639
how can you the easiest the easiest

507
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
thing to do it

508
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
is to for the application to carefully

509
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,639
differentiate between

510
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,400
what is a hint and and that's also what

511
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,960
we already say in research

512
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,720
what is a hint like if if there is a if

513
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,200
there is an indication of content form

514
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
of accepted content types on a resource

515
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,280
the worst thing that will happen is that

516
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,799
the content types will be downgraded

517
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,399
but the interaction will still be the

518
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,520
same and what

519
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,159
is a statement that is really

520
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,360
necessary to be under to be to come from

521
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,000
a trusted source

522
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,320
and then for the client to differentiate

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,240
can i use this piece of information

524
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,240
um or can i not and

525
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,480
once we have that in place we can think

526
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,039
more about how can a client

527
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,559
get by that piece of information in a

528
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,559
more efficient way

529
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,200
without go doing a round trip through

530
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,720
the origin server all the time

531
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,039
things like also come right

532
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,039
thank you

533
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,679
francesca please sorry you were in the

534
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
queue

535
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
yeah basically joran said what i wanted

536
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,279
to to ask

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,200
um but i wanted to ask more about this

538
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,880
uh single view servers which i didn't

539
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,559
really understand

540
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,799
uh how that uh um

541
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,559
the idea is just don't have a pub sub

542
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,000
server and a dos me

543
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,520
server run on the same on

544
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,919
within the same security context and

545
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
then you'll be talking to different

546
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,919
authors

547
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,080
to different resource servers

548
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,760
and have different um security

549
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,960
associations with them

550
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,240
so you can accidentally um hit the wrong

551
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,360
button

552
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,080
so so my question is are are these the

553
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,240
bullets

554
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
in a slide

555
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,559
uh yes these are to be taken together

556
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,600
these are not

557
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,678
several different options or

558
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,158
these these are different options that

559
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,720
may be combined

560
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,720
okay thanks

561
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,879
but again these options will be out of

562
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,360
the scope of rd

563
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,360
as such yes because rd

564
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,039
gives rd says that do the second one and

565
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,760
um hopefully do it well but we don't

566
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,360
have good guidance to point you

567
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,840
may i ask you planning to add this to

568
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,279
the rd extensions or a different

569
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:17,520
uh

570
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
i think they should i think this one

571
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,440
place this should definitely wind up is

572
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,559
the discussion about coral

573
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
because um coral forms are way more

574
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,559
powerful

575
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,679
in the sense that the surf that whoever

576
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,399
presents the form can make the

577
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,200
um can make the client issue more

578
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:43,840
complex um

579
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:43,840
a wider variety of statements

580
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,039
matthew

581
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,039
i think we have matthew in the queue but

582
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,360
no one else is talking so matthew

583
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:11,840
you can just unmute yourself on the top

584
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:11,840
right button

585
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,840
uh marco we don't hear you you are

586
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,840
speaking as well no no

587
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,440
uh matt we cannot mute you you need to

588
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:39,840
mute yourself and just

589
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:39,840
speak can you try again matt

590
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,879
maybe you can't hear us either now

591
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,480
well matt just feel free to jump in

592
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,960
uh later also so that we have all the

593
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,159
questions or use the chat other it is

594
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,720
um so i'll relay from the jabber

595
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,120
uh can you read it also christian yeah

596
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,799
the question is um

597
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,439
can the security issues be addressed

598
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,760
with link layer security um

599
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,679
only if that linked late if the link

600
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
layer security extends to the origin

601
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,919
server which in most

602
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,480
cases it will not so link layer security

603
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,080
would

604
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,159
might might get you to the resource

605
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,158
directory um

606
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,840
but in the general case it won't get you

607
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,440
to the origin server and will not give

608
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,559
you better other

609
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,840
any better statements about the um

610
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:49,840
any better verification on the

611
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:49,840
statements that the client will act on

612
00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:03,840
okay thank you

613
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,600
we see you we do not

614
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,879
hear you yet maybe you you are muted

615
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,320
still i mean

616
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,200
i can oops um

617
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,399
michael we don't we don't hear you or i

618
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,760
don't hear you at least

619
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:50,399
same here i can hear michael

620
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,600
oh uh michael we don't hear you

621
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:59,840
can you try again let me just revoke uh

622
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,840
this try again try once again

623
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,600
uh you are muted the video is okay but

624
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
you are muted

625
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,000
do we need to give some permission or

626
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,320
something no no no

627
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,600
that should be all inside

628
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,960
yeah it seems that the

629
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,959
there's few glitches here and there

630
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,679
on the various browsers right now

631
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,039
yeah now it works go ahead reload it

632
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,039
again so it's been re

633
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,399
disconnected about three times since we

634
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,080
started the meeting

635
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:37,439
um okay so uh core stateless so

636
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,918
stuck on review comments since uh may

637
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,520
um next slide please these are slides

638
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,919
are mostly the same as in the virtual

639
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
interim this is really the update so

640
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
a bunch of these were marked as don't

641
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,559
won't fix um you can go through them and

642
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,600
read the

643
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,000
um comments if you like the about this

644
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,279
and there are some emails about that on

645
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,279
the list next slide please

646
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,320
um one of the things was a suggestion to

647
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,360
use automatic key management but

648
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,720
that would only really apply if in fact

649
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
there was another peer

650
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,760
so in this case what we're talking about

651
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,760
is um

652
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,360
a node is going to send a token to

653
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,720
another node the other node is not going

654
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,918
to decrypt it but rather it's going to

655
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
echo it back

656
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,760
uh with the response and so actually

657
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
you can use any kind of uh randomly

658
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,919
generated key you like

659
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,360
um and you just encrypt your token and

660
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,960
then when you get it back you decrypt

661
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
your token so you just basically have to

662
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,039
make sure that you

663
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
still have the key around and that it's

664
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
strong enough or

665
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,159
fast enough to deal with the fact that

666
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,559
you could have an attacker trying to

667
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
send you lots of random uh nonsense so

668
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,120
you don't want to burn out your battery

669
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,640
trying to deal with that um so there's a

670
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,080
preference for using for instance

671
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,120
whatever hardware accelerated

672
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,639
uh encryption algorithm you have

673
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,600
um and the text now has some

674
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,600
recommendations

675
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,678
and some issues about the replay window

676
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,959
which is to say how long you will

677
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,919
stick around and allow keys to uh sorry

678
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,039
responses

679
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,640
to arrive out of order um

680
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
before you start saying well wait a

681
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,440
minute i it they're

682
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,600
they're probably too old and i won't

683
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,399
accept anymore an attacker could for

684
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
instance

685
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,600
uh instead of just making up a token

686
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,279
could for instance

687
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,918
um record some data um and play it back

688
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,320
at you

689
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
to either cause you to redo something

690
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,039
that was not item potent

691
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:36,799
or to um just to mess up your network

692
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,799
that way next slide please

693
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,399
um so the 60 minutes what had to do with

694
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,080
the replay minute so we've got some

695
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,360
better text for that

696
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,799
it's been reviewed and some other text

697
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,479
relating to the integrity protection

698
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,279
that i just speaking about

699
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,279
next slide please

700
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,640
so um 07 was uploaded on the

701
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,639
on the 12 on november 2.

702
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:10,000
08 was uploaded uh 25 minutes ago

703
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,360
um as i was pointed out that the

704
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,399
it could now be uploaded um and ben has

705
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,879
has replied actually today just uh

706
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,000
or whatever that means today uh a few

707
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,360
hours ago

708
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,360
and uh has cleared the discuss um and

709
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,719
there may be one additional cycle

710
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,918
perhaps about

711
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,519
some tweaking some words um but i don't

712
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,159
think so and that's it

713
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,159
any questions

714
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,720
um i believe oh sorry go ahead

715
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,080
sorry again just um let me know when you

716
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
think it's ready to go

717
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,519
and i'll give it a final check and do

718
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,200
the approval

719
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,679
i think that with oh eight it's ready to

720
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,480
go okay so you you don't want to make

721
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,640
any tweaks

722
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,399
uh i i don't know i'm just saying there

723
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,720
there could be a there could be a

724
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,439
conversation about moving a word here or

725
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,600
there

726
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,840
um but i don't think it's it will fall

727
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,199
into the category of discuss

728
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,519
okay well yeah and so and any anything

729
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,000
that you get uh that's a minor editorial

730
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,240
thing we can do enough for you anyway so

731
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,559
okay i'll give it a look over there and

732
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,679
uh and send out the approval

733
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,678
thank you very much um michael

734
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
i believe klaus gave some comments

735
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,600
yesterday that those are also pro

736
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,120
they were positive but just to know if

737
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,199
you have to have a look at them they are

738
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,399
i have not seen them i'll look in the

739
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,360
archive uh

740
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,080
so uh yeah i've just woken up for

741
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,199
tuesday

742
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,480
so yeah it should be on the issue

743
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,279
no i don't think it was on the main list

744
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
okay um i'm sorry then i haven't i

745
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,799
haven't dealt with them and barry maybe

746
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,000
i take back what i just said

747
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,120
so let me show you positive

748
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,720
they are positive they are mostly

749
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,719
positive so i think you you wouldn't

750
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,320
have to change anything

751
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,600
okay well then that's great all right

752
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,600
but have a look just in case

753
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,679
okay great

754
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,440
any i see there is a discussion on

755
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,359
miteko but it's not related to this

756
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,560
any uh and now we have your video as

757
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,279
well

758
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:20,159
um so any comments on stateless anything

759
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,879
any last thoughts before we conclude the

760
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,800
draft

761
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,799
well when michael sends the oh wait

762
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,199
so i actually have two copies of myself

763
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,560
as video

764
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,199
because i already thought i was sending

765
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:38,560
video interesting

766
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:42,000
yeah okay i mean this was a very

767
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,359
uh brief presentation but i think

768
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,040
everything has been pretty much covered

769
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,639
during the interim so maybe there is no

770
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,239
need to duel any longer

771
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,879
on this topic another comment sorry

772
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,638
i know all right there is no okay then

773
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,480
let's move on

774
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,400
to the next topic uh just a second

775
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,720
thank you michael by the way i thank you

776
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,520
for the very quick uh

777
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,560
uh agile uh way of preparing the slides

778
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,599
so

779
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:14,400
it was a bit the last minute request

780
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,400
um so i believe the next one

781
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,160
was

782
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,560
yeah secure group communication so group

783
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,200
on bs

784
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,200
just a second

785
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:33,680
okay

786
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,520
ah yes go we have audio issues again

787
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,480
yeah same as before

788
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,960
yeah same as before but we do see you we

789
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,880
see the video

790
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,160
hey morning can you try to reset the

791
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,560
audio stream

792
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,759
on the bottom right of the windows go

793
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:59,839
that seems to do the work

794
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:59,839
for many

795
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,520
i think we all are using flavors of

796
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,640
chrome one way or another

797
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,880
so i think that's a recommended

798
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,078
browser probably not to advertise

799
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,520
anything in particular but

800
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,440
okay it actually work yes

801
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
please go ahead i think i think you have

802
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,880
to reset

803
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,160
first and then unmute again so

804
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,400
that's the trick so it happens if you uh

805
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,720
were not connected to audio before i

806
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,520
think then

807
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,480
okay maybe let's start with the

808
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,079
presentation now

809
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,320
good communication

810
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,079
uh so we are presenting here this

811
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,119
revision two

812
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,160
yeah this is just an overall uh goal of

813
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,480
group communication

814
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:56,240
yeah this slide so it's intended as the

815
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,720
successor of rc7390

816
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,399
and now recast as a standard track

817
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,799
document

818
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,160
and in scope is co-op group

819
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,079
communication over

820
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,920
udp ip and now also

821
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,119
possibly secured with groupon score

822
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,119
okay next slide please

823
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,800
so i'll give now an overview of the

824
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,200
status updates of the

825
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,160
zero two revision and there's also the

826
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,118
tickets uh

827
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,399
linked to that and so the first thing we

828
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,200
changed

829
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,400
well was to clarify the messaging and

830
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,160
endpoint model

831
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,079
we had some discussion that the server

832
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,399
might actually respond from a different

833
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,880
udp port

834
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,520
and that turns out to be a legitimate

835
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,040
way of responding to multicast

836
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,800
in co-op so this is now clarified in the

837
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,359
messaging model text

838
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
and then issue number two that's a very

839
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,040
small

840
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,799
change we had some requirement for uh

841
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,520
consistency for response suppression

842
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,079
so now it's based on the class of the

843
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,000
response

844
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,880
code so if a server typically

845
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,720
yeah suppresses a response of a certain

846
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,839
class like

847
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,598
4.x or 5.x due to policies

848
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:21,440
then it should be consistent so that all

849
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,480
the responses of that class

850
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,480
are also suppressed

851
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,680
and number three is basically the

852
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,799
section that we had on group

853
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,560
definition it was some a big piece of

854
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,079
text so this is now expanded into

855
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,279
sub-sections

856
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,359
and we have more details on the relation

857
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
relations between the different group

858
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,960
types so there's the

859
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,839
co-op group application group and the

860
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,839
security group

861
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,040
um yeah there's also the option added

862
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,040
after discussion that we could use the

863
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,040
uri host option

864
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,599
for encoding application group and

865
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,759
that's a possible way to do it

866
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,000
but on the other hand it has some

867
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,440
problems of its own so i also added a

868
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,640
best practice

869
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,280
for how groups are typically included in

870
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,118
co-op requests which is in the your

871
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,359
right path

872
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,359
but of course both methods are fine to

873
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,880
use

874
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,880
okay next slide please

875
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,520
and yeah the next change was that the

876
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,320
fetch method was also included

877
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,359
many places were applicable so where

878
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,480
before it said

879
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,759
get we now say often is get or fetch if

880
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
it applies

881
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,800
also in the observe and the blockwise

882
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,560
is included now and there were

883
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,160
quite some changes in the text so that

884
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,078
that falls under the various

885
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,440
enhancement and editorial

886
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,560
one of these things is for example

887
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,040
explaining that you can do

888
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,560
re-registration with observe

889
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,279
as well so a little bit more detail

890
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,520
all right let's move to the next slide

891
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
now

892
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,160
so this is just a picture corresponding

893
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,599
to this

894
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,359
issue number one where the server

895
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,480
response may come

896
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,040
from a different udp port at the server

897
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,720
so we've shown this also in a previous

898
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,000
presentation i think in yeah either the

899
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,200
interim or the

900
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,200
previous itf meeting

901
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,280
okay the next slide please

902
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,640
yeah so what are the next steps of this

903
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,200
draft um

904
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,879
yeah there was some feedback from marco

905
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,439
i received the last minute so i think he

906
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,480
can

907
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,920
tell more about it so one of the first

908
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,160
things was

909
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,520
due to the interrupt experience of last

910
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,399
week it was the idea to move the

911
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,800
handling of

912
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,720
multiple cog responses from the co-op

913
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,760
layer and to the application layer so

914
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,959
that means

915
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,680
maybe some text in 2.3.1

916
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,160
and all this needs to be changed

917
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,118
and the second point was the proxy

918
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,480
operation

919
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,839
233 it's not really talking about

920
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,920
much about caching of responses

921
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,000
and i think what we need to do is first

922
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,040
explore maybe some scenarios in

923
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,240
caching so suppose a

924
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,880
client sends out a request

925
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,479
to a proxy and that leads to a group

926
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,480
communication

927
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,640
operation so the proxy sends out the

928
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,400
multicast and receives the responses to

929
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,960
that

930
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,319
so are there situations where the proxy

931
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,000
can actually suppress

932
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,240
the sending of the multi-customer quest

933
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,640
so what if another client comes

934
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,759
does a similar or the same request can

935
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,040
it actually suppress

936
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,319
in that case the sending of multicast

937
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,000
requests and instead serve from the

938
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,720
cache

939
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,960
and also yeah is the proxy able to do a

940
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,759
cache refresh so it

941
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,720
for example it knows it already has a 90

942
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,760
of the responses

943
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,439
cached and they are fresh as well so

944
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,599
can i do a refresh to see if

945
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,480
yeah if there are other devices that

946
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,960
just

947
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,560
joined the same group and are not in the

948
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,440
cache yet

949
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
so this is a bit of a yeah still open

950
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,079
topic

951
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:28,319
also open for discussion here if people

952
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,319
want

953
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,319
it's relatively new so i think this uh

954
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,720
concludes the presentation

955
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,119
there's one thank you slide still with

956
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,560
the link so if there's any

957
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,040
issues please uh mail or use the issue

958
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,160
tracker

959
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,560
to report oh yeah no one more thing yeah

960
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,560
there's more reviews would also be good

961
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,680
for these graphs

962
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,599
i just marks here cristiano in france

963
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,440
i think who made a promise at itf 108 to

964
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,160
do a review

965
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,760
and also what we think also want to do

966
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,560
is to test test

967
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,000
more in co-op implementations and for

968
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,119
example

969
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,680
observe combined with multicast and also

970
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,079
yeah report the results of the testing

971
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,078
on this

972
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,960
all right that's it yeah thanks

973
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,200
let's go we have a comment from carsten

974
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,760
in the chat carson if you want to take

975
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,759
it on the mic

976
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,440
well yeah just

977
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,680
uh fantasizing um wouldn't it be nice if

978
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,640
we could e tags for all responses that

979
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,640
we have in cash

980
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,359
uh i i don't know how to make this work

981
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,560
but

982
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,240
once operation based on

983
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,000
having cash information already

984
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,598
available what would be a nice

985
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,260
feature yeah i was also thinking of

986
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,440
these

987
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,359
[Music]

988
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
something like these e-tags in detail so

989
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,119
that

990
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,400
the the many servers maybe only need to

991
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,599
respond

992
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,280
uh when their information has changed

993
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,359
with respect to the

994
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:23,440
yeah the cached request

995
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,279
so that it could be a direction indeed

996
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,680
but i haven't thought myself that much

997
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,240
about it yet

998
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,919
kristen i'm just um we've we've brought

999
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,598
this up in a in a

1000
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,599
discussion during the hackathon and i

1001
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,520
don't think that there's anything that

1002
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,880
would stop this from working

1003
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,920
um other than the server needing to

1004
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,160
um needing to react on

1005
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,040
oh wait no sorry i missed something that

1006
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,799
we found

1007
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,560
there yeah sure on the server wouldn't

1008
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,720
know if there's any other

1009
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,400
and the client wouldn't know if any

1010
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,520
servers had collisions on their e-text

1011
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,560
so that's the

1012
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,560
that's the hard point there

1013
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,440
positions on e-tanks um

1014
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:07,200
one server's e-tag that is met that is

1015
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,720
that matches another service e-tag that

1016
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,720
just happened to change to that value

1017
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,000
okay yeah you would have you would have

1018
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,359
to include some server identification

1019
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,680
together with the

1020
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:25,119
e-tag because the the request addresses

1021
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,720
somebody different from from

1022
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,520
who the e-tags are associated

1023
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,118
with so that's why this becomes big and

1024
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,520
ugly

1025
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,520
very quickly and why i haven't actually

1026
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,560
made a proposal out of that but

1027
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,680
i think maybe we can continue to think

1028
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,839
in that

1029
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,680
direction another possibility we we

1030
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:48,400
explored in that hackathon discussion

1031
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,440
was

1032
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,640
that um the client might request might

1033
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,800
send the request to the

1034
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,480
very small block size which at least

1035
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,720
allows the servers to

1036
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,400
send short responses and then the client

1037
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,279
to follow up with those services that

1038
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,280
actually have changes

1039
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,078
yeah that could also fit to the group

1040
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,640
communication

1041
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,839
model of beta so you typically want to

1042
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,240
not not send

1043
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,440
large responses back by the servers but

1044
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,359
they

1045
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,839
typically would send a short message

1046
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,839
back or short response or their first

1047
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
block

1048
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:46,640
is commenting uh if you want the hat

1049
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,640
method

1050
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
yeah that's basically uh i think in

1051
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,839
co-op that's the

1052
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,799
block-wise transfer right that's a

1053
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,520
similar

1054
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,160
although yeah it's more implicit than a

1055
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,160
hat method

1056
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,720
exactly

1057
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,839
all right

1058
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:25,839
so any more comments

1059
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:39,839
seems not also in the chat

1060
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,559
so i guess you can hear me and see me

1061
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,558
now

1062
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,319
yes okay great

1063
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,599
so this is an update of the group score

1064
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:10,558
document

1065
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,559
now needs version 10. next slide please

1066
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,520
uh the version tender we submitted right

1067
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,000
before the cut off

1068
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,599
includes updates mostly addressing

1069
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,119
comments we received uh

1070
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,880
following the working group plus call

1071
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,839
that closed in july

1072
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,559
uh two reviews out of them and more

1073
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:30,240
comments

1074
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,800
that came up around itf 108 and right

1075
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,399
after

1076
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
so i have an overview of them in the

1077
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,880
next slides

1078
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,040
otherwise we had a third i think

1079
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,040
interrupt

1080
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,720
set of tests during uh the past

1081
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,160
hackathon with three different

1082
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,799
implementations

1083
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,598
um involved and for the first time we

1084
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,800
also

1085
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,680
tested successfully uh the pairwise mode

1086
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,880
of group of score uh considering

1087
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,960
different algorithms

1088
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,880
and and different combination of roles

1089
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,240
so more testosterone but

1090
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,480
i think we have covered all the main

1091
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,040
functionalities here now

1092
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,760
and again during the the hackathon last

1093
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,599
week we received a review from christian

1094
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,160
thank you very much for that

1095
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,400
of this version 10 that will process for

1096
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,839
the for the next round

1097
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,839
next slide please

1098
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,680
right an overview of the updates in this

1099
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,078
version 10 um

1100
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,799
some regarded the the security context

1101
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,280
uh it was noticed some information was

1102
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,960
just redundant so we removed the counter

1103
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,079
signature key parameters

1104
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,040
as all that information um is indicated

1105
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,240
already in the

1106
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:41,200
counter signature uh parameters

1107
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,879
entry related to the algorithm while we

1108
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,720
also added some

1109
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,640
more parameters in the common context

1110
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,240
highlighted in red here

1111
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,078
describing the algorithm and the

1112
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,919
properties uh

1113
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,480
for the pairwise mode if this is

1114
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,800
supported of course

1115
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,400
um as a suggestion also around working

1116
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,359
group call

1117
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,720
we added the possibility for a server to

1118
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:07,520
reply with a

1119
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:10,399
503 error to a client in case

1120
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,640
all is in principle fine but the server

1121
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,960
doesn't have a recipient context

1122
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,480
already right at the moment especially

1123
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,040
doesn't have the public key for that

1124
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,640
client

1125
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,640
and is not a good time right now to to

1126
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,118
go and retrieve that

1127
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,598
so client please come back soon to me

1128
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,280
and and we can make it work

1129
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,880
uh of course it's an optional thing to

1130
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,440
do uh for the server

1131
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
uh rather than just responding with uh

1132
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,800
with a general error like context not

1133
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,000
found

1134
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:43,920
uh we have also worked on non-recycling

1135
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,680
policies of ids at the group manager

1136
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,079
what we say right now is to never ever

1137
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,879
reassign uh reassign the same sender id

1138
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,280
value

1139
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,319
in the same group and based on

1140
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,800
christian's review

1141
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,640
um there's an open point about a

1142
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,160
slightly uh relaxing it

1143
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:05,279
but i'll come to that uh later on uh

1144
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,558
instead we never reuse the same group id

1145
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,559
value so the same

1146
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:14,800
id context for the same group during

1147
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,800
its lifetime next slide please

1148
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,520
right something happened also for the

1149
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,160
sequence number eventually

1150
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,880
we convert for keeping things as they

1151
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,000
are for the

1152
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,480
the space of value so we keep one single

1153
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,880
space

1154
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
shared for both the group mode and the

1155
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,119
pairwise mode

1156
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,800
uh but we introduce the change so that

1157
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,680
whenever the context is

1158
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,440
uh updated or re-established meaning a

1159
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,440
new sender id is assigned

1160
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,280
or there's a whole group requiring and

1161
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,119
the key material changes

1162
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,040
um the assignment the sender sequence

1163
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,040
number is reset to zero

1164
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,480
and that simplifies a lot also for other

1165
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,480
group members to

1166
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,440
understand that a change of key material

1167
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,079
has happened in the first place

1168
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,760
uh we better clarify the requirement

1169
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,520
that wasn't uh

1170
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:07,280
to clear in the previous version uh even

1171
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,359
is protected with a latest new context

1172
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,040
which happens to be different uh from

1173
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,279
the one used to protect the request

1174
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,520
because of an interleaved wrecking well

1175
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,520
the server definitely has to use

1176
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,280
its sender sequence number as partially

1177
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:23,359
v to be included in the response

1178
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:26,079
to avoid answer usage um

1179
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,160
also now that as i mentioned before the

1180
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:32,000
sender sequence number is reset

1181
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:35,040
in case of raking and we still

1182
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,160
want to have observations surviving uh

1183
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,000
across uh a possible raking

1184
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,000
and we need to do something to be sure

1185
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,960
that a given notification

1186
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,079
cannot match with more than one original

1187
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,160
registration request

1188
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,599
cryptographically that means that

1189
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,160
all observations have to be linked with

1190
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,040
the same

1191
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,240
original observation request also by the

1192
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,400
original

1193
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,558
group id that was used when the

1194
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,720
registration request was sent

1195
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,760
and that practically meant including one

1196
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,439
more parameter

1197
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,720
in the external aed as request kid

1198
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,079
context

1199
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,200
specifying in fact the original group id

1200
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,680
value used

1201
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,759
uh in the registration request so this

1202
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,319
is beneficial necessary for observations

1203
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,440
only but

1204
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:27,279
practically um it ends up in in the

1205
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,920
external ids for all messages of course

1206
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,720
uh

1207
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,720
next slide please

1208
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,040
okay and something more again on

1209
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,079
supporting observation

1210
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,279
um exactly for what i've just mentioned

1211
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,000
we were saying already in previous

1212
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,200
versions that the client and the server

1213
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,280
have to store the original key id

1214
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,960
from the registration request now they

1215
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,000
just have to do the same also for the

1216
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,280
original

1217
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,839
group id and to clarify some comments

1218
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,920
around this from working group

1219
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,319
call the client technically has to store

1220
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,280
them

1221
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,520
only if it really cares about having

1222
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,720
observations from inside

1223
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,359
um surviving across a possible group

1224
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,078
wrecking

1225
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,160
otherwise it can just choose to forget

1226
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:15,520
about them in that case and doesn't need

1227
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,440
to store those values um

1228
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,119
again in that case it's also beneficial

1229
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,760
for the client to store

1230
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,480
an invariant identifier of the oscar

1231
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,800
group that

1232
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,400
really never changes across group

1233
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,800
rankings

1234
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,480
and that can practically be what we call

1235
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,000
a group name

1236
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,920
in related ace documents

1237
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,119
and that simplifies for the client the

1238
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,960
possible

1239
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,880
dialogue later on with the group manager

1240
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,040
to retrieve updated

1241
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,480
group key material by still using this

1242
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,000
constant

1243
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,160
group name even in case of group

1244
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,839
wrecking

1245
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,839
next slide please

1246
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,160
thanks uh so that concludes the update

1247
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,680
on version 10 uh some highlights from

1248
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,078
from christian review and before coming

1249
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,319
to

1250
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,280
open points to to share with the group

1251
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,680
uh there was

1252
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,280
one main point that we discussed for

1253
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,160
several hours during the

1254
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,880
the academ concluding that um the draft

1255
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,040
should be

1256
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,240
a better distinction between the the

1257
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,880
anti-replay

1258
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,439
and possible uh freshness requirements

1259
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,280
that

1260
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,520
have to be of course addressed in

1261
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,119
different ways uh which includes also

1262
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,440
better clarification of what we mean

1263
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,280
with a server synchronizing

1264
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,280
with a client which is strictly related

1265
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,599
to to freshness

1266
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,599
and building on this we have different

1267
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:37,599
approaches for synchronization in

1268
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:39,200
appendix e and and out of the discussion

1269
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,640
we could understand that we definitely

1270
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,960
still need the approach

1271
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,078
on appendix e3 based on the echo

1272
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,400
exchange

1273
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,520
uh for the sake of making replay windows

1274
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,319
valid and

1275
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,040
also achieve freshness thanks to that

1276
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,960
but then

1277
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,720
that basically following those

1278
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,680
clarifications would make

1279
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,640
the the current approaches in e1 and v2

1280
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,200
uh

1281
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,040
well basically moot uh as not

1282
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,960
contributing to freshness

1283
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,640
and not contributing to under replay

1284
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,280
very much other than what you already

1285
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,118
have from

1286
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,599
a correct and valid replay window so

1287
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:14,880
they can

1288
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,920
possibly just be removed and while

1289
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,200
discussing uh

1290
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,240
on this we found also one more possible

1291
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,598
reason to have

1292
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:26,078
a loss of mutable security context of

1293
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,760
part of it and and especially the

1294
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,079
recipient context

1295
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,680
that can happen because servers have

1296
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,839
memory limitations that

1297
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,879
practically set a maximum amount of

1298
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:39,920
recipient context that can be

1299
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,720
around at the same time inside the group

1300
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,200
context

1301
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,118
well when that limit is reached and as

1302
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,480
new clients continue to come the server

1303
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,119
has to

1304
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:51,119
destroy a current recipient context to

1305
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:52,880
leave room for a new one

1306
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,200
when when this kind of overflow is

1307
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,200
reached uh from then on

1308
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,680
if the server creates a new recipient

1309
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,040
contest it can be a recreation

1310
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:05,200
of one context that used to be there uh

1311
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,119
and essentially from then on each newly

1312
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,078
created recipient context would start

1313
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,359
with an invalid

1314
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,880
uh replay window and from then on is

1315
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,359
replay protection is still

1316
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,720
important uh that server either has to

1317
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,880
be rekeyed

1318
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,959
through the group manager or it has to

1319
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,319
run the the echo exchange again

1320
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,799
uh gaining freshness too so this has all

1321
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,520
to be

1322
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,759
a clarified better in the next version

1323
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,640
in fact

1324
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,640
next slide please

1325
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,440
then we have also some open points

1326
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,960
following from from this review

1327
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,000
i mentioned one before about relaxing uh

1328
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,839
the no recycling of sender ids from the

1329
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,640
group manager now it really says

1330
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,839
uh never ever uh for the group manager

1331
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,960
never give the same

1332
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:57,759
sender id uh in the same group

1333
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,640
that eventually leads for larger and

1334
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,000
larger

1335
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,118
kids uh in size and there's no way back

1336
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,520
for that

1337
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,400
and we thought that we can possibly

1338
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,920
relax

1339
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,119
this so that sender ids don't have to be

1340
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,760
a recycle ever

1341
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,880
under the same group id value but if

1342
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,640
there is a keying

1343
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,440
and the group id value changes

1344
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,799
the current review sender ids are locked

1345
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,640
again

1346
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:26,640
but any value free at that moment

1347
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,319
becomes also safely

1348
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,839
available to be assigned

1349
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:37,839
is there any issue anyone sees on this

1350
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
change

1351
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,319
yes yes going jordan

1352
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,000
okay you're on here um

1353
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,520
[Music]

1354
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,599
so how do you

1355
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,599
how do you make sure that you actually

1356
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:06,480
only recycle when you've changed the gid

1357
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:08,319
or i mean maybe that's trivial but i

1358
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,680
is still under the control of the group

1359
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,680
manager uh

1360
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,680
after all and the raking and the change

1361
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,118
of group id is triggered by the group

1362
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,000
manager

1363
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,960
so it knows when it becomes safe so it's

1364
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,480
the ins design

1365
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,920
the assignment from the group manager

1366
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,920
that's yes that's what yeah okay

1367
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,079
okay thanks thank you

1368
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,799
yeah no i think i was not in the queue

1369
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:36,319
but i i didn't have a question anyhow

1370
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:38,559
so it was i think the group id

1371
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:40,240
value so will will that ever change then

1372
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,720
or

1373
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,520
is that also something that can change

1374
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,160
the group id

1375
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,680
changes if the key material changes

1376
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,598
because the group manager

1377
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,200
ultimately takes the decision to rekey

1378
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:52,960
the group

1379
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,359
when the group id changes and that

1380
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,960
happens in case of working

1381
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,720
we're just saying is possible that

1382
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,119
sender id is not

1383
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,200
currently used really at the moment can

1384
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,799
also become free for reassignment

1385
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,520
and it's safe to do yeah well that

1386
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:12,079
sounds at least safe to me to do that so

1387
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:12,079
no issues

1388
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,119
okay thank you um

1389
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,640
and next other point was about the

1390
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,280
external aad

1391
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,920
structure uh on the left you see what we

1392
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,839
have now

1393
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,040
one version is for the encryption

1394
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:30,160
operation

1395
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:32,558
and one version is for the signing

1396
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,598
operation for the group mode only

1397
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:38,160
uh we started with this design uh

1398
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,920
before editing in the last version

1399
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,960
request kd context

1400
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,720
because before doing that uh the version

1401
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,599
on the extreme left for encryption was

1402
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,520
really

1403
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:51,520
uh mirroring the version from oscore

1404
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,440
uh while we introduced the version for

1405
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,079
signing only for the group mode but

1406
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,280
now that we have added request kd

1407
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,319
context

1408
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:11,839
the version for encryption already is

1409
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:11,839
essentially deviating

1410
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,680
into

1411
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,200
okay i think the video is lost from

1412
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,839
marco

1413
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:39,839
all right yeah we lost your video and

1414
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,839
audio for a brief moment

1415
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,839
to be used both for encryption and

1416
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,839
signing of course

1417
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,000
yeah you're on here i think that's

1418
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,200
unreasonable but we need to

1419
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,440
look at the details

1420
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,439
okay

1421
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,480
uh there's a comment on the chat i think

1422
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:21,680
oh no just on the last audio okay

1423
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:24,319
thank you uh next slide please

1424
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,680
yeah and and more on the external id it

1425
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:29,200
was noted again that

1426
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:35,839
um as is today already we have again

1427
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,839
that redundancy

1428
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,839
uh

1429
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:12,558
because then i'm just i think whatever

1430
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,720
we do there should be aligned with

1431
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,839
how those things are precisely defined

1432
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,839
in cozy

1433
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,200
did we did we just lose marco

1434
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,799
yeah i saw his video disappear now yeah

1435
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:41,839
and there he's back you lost me yep

1436
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:45,839
but the video got cut for a second okay

1437
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:45,839
everything reset on my side

1438
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,559
okay i think i was asking um should we

1439
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,359
do

1440
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:55,839
this deletion in the external led

1441
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:55,839
structure

1442
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,839
an opinion

1443
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,759
okay a little bit open also to discuss

1444
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,039
on the list and

1445
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:15,280
one last point i think is still

1446
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:18,240
related to the um external ead structure

1447
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:20,240
and right now we are covering the the

1448
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,078
the current set of existing and register

1449
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,640
cosy algorithms

1450
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,400
uh for each of which the only algorithm

1451
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,440
capability registered

1452
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,680
is the key type and that results

1453
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,480
also in the parking design parameter to

1454
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,799
specify

1455
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,920
in fact only the capabilities of that

1456
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:39,119
key type

1457
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,200
in turn so we started to wonder if we

1458
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:44,480
can take this opportunity to

1459
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,960
generalize this format a bit more for

1460
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,680
possible future algorithms that cosi

1461
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,480
would

1462
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:51,200
theoretically admit that can have zero

1463
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,760
or

1464
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,919
more than one capability and then

1465
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,960
require more information to be

1466
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,319
um expressed there as capabilities in

1467
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,839
power counter sign

1468
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:06,880
and there is a kind of abstract uh

1469
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,880
meta format that we can consider for it

1470
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,240
but for what we have today they would

1471
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,599
practically become

1472
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,038
uh what we have already uh so to say are

1473
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,839
coded in detail

1474
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,839
in the document

1475
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,839
any comment or input on this

1476
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,520
you can still hear me right

1477
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,759
yeah we can hear you yes i was thinking

1478
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,759
um

1479
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,760
this this new format you propose so is

1480
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,839
it kind of backwards compatible with

1481
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,599
it while it's there today or is it a

1482
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:49,759
small change

1483
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,240
it is backward compatible meaning that

1484
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:53,599
on on the practical value you you build

1485
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,558
today with current implementation

1486
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:59,839
nothing changes but it is more flexible

1487
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,319
looking forward actually okay it's more

1488
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,240
like

1489
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,079
the definition is then ready for the

1490
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,558
future yeah

1491
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,559
kind of okay that sounds good at least

1492
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,119
okay i'll open issues on github for all

1493
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,319
these points and and more from

1494
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,920
christian's review anyway

1495
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,400
next slide please and that should be the

1496
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,400
last one

1497
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:32,078
okay uh yeah this version is addressed

1498
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,000
comments for working group last coal and

1499
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:36,000
around the the previous meeting with a

1500
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,079
successful test at the akaton

1501
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,760
as next step is submitting version 11

1502
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,640
addressing christian's review

1503
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,720
and run even some more tests again in

1504
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,839
pairwise mode testing also some

1505
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,839
error conditions

1506
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,039
that concludes it

1507
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,559
and hi maybe you're sharing your screen

1508
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,359
at least i'm not seeing it

1509
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,000
maybe it's just my side though oh i'm

1510
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:03,598
sharing i'm

1511
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,359
um i think esco can you see it

1512
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:11,280
yeah yeah okay we are now on the last

1513
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:11,279
slide with the thank you comment song

1514
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:17,599
um

1515
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:18,880
that's okay then carson also says that

1516
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,240
it works for him

1517
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,240
so christian do you have some comments

1518
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:27,680
um sorry i was just unmuting because i'm

1519
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:31,118
kind of messed up in the queue

1520
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:35,038
okay so i guess no more comments then

1521
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,039
thank you well then thank you marco

1522
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:46,960
um

1523
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:50,240
we are now halfway on the time wise

1524
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:54,000
so we still have an hour to go well

1525
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:57,359
now um 53 minutes to be precise

1526
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,240
so christian whenever you are ready um

1527
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,240
yep i am

1528
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:11,839
now it's okay now it's sorry i'll just

1529
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,839
get in again

1530
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:39,839
so christian um if you are

1531
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:39,839
here manifest please manifest yourself

1532
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:50,239
[Music]

1533
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,158
do you hear me now yes we hear you there

1534
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:56,080
is no video um

1535
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:56,080
but this is what you can do without

1536
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,960
um so to recap uh what this is

1537
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:05,198
all about um

1538
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,799
when uh when a device enters a network

1539
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,198
that is configured to join a group

1540
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:11,040
it may have very limited information so

1541
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,198
it may know that it has

1542
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:15,120
this particular application group and it

1543
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,198
will probably have some

1544
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,960
some credentials stored but it may not

1545
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:22,158
know where this resource director

1546
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,359
where this group actually is um

1547
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:28,238
how to join it etc and link

1548
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,359
and web linking can generate a next clip

1549
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:31,278
history

1550
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,719
web linking can generally help with that

1551
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,359
and the resource directory

1552
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,399
is the typical place to make this more

1553
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,600
efficient

1554
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:42,639
in a core based network

1555
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,319
so what the device when joining can do

1556
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:45,920
is that it knows its application group

1557
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,279
it queries the resource directory for

1558
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,158
the joining resource

1559
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,120
and it may do something similar for the

1560
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:53,920
for getting the

1561
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,519
actual group address to to join on next

1562
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,480
slide clip

1563
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,840
so in the in the updates that were

1564
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,599
published before this itf um

1565
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,000
we basically addressed the the

1566
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,800
the comments that came in and closed

1567
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,239
several of the

1568
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,719
of the open points so we um we now state

1569
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:14,639
explicitly that a few things that the

1570
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,760
that the cozy registry theoretically

1571
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,239
allowed allows can just not be done

1572
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,000
with this with link format because it

1573
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,759
can distinguish between a literal

1574
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,840
minus two and the digit minus two

1575
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,040
um we've added a mechanism for

1576
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,120
discovering where

1577
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,400
the where the authorization server for a

1578
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,880
particular resource

1579
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,759
uh is located which should allow the

1580
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,920
which basically

1581
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,679
saves the round trip to the to the

1582
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,080
resource server

1583
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,440
in but exchanges this for router to the

1584
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,559
resource directory

1585
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:49,599
let's type this which is okay um there's

1586
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:53,120
a few more updates when it comes to

1587
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,640
um to the precise values we're using for

1588
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,199
resource type and interface which are

1589
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,960
now

1590
01:10:55,199 --> 01:11:00,879
aligned better with with our documents

1591
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,080
where they are partially moved or where

1592
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,159
they are taken from

1593
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,080
so we don't uh we don't specify any of

1594
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:09,839
this ourselves anymore

1595
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,280
next slide is um what we do currently

1596
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:13,679
specify because the

1597
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,400
because nothing else in ace is doing

1598
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,880
this so far

1599
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,159
is describe how those web links can be

1600
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,960
used to discover

1601
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:23,040
where the um where the authorization

1602
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,920
server for a particular resource

1603
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,440
is located so when the registration is

1604
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,440
done in this way with this additional

1605
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,839
piece of information

1606
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,040
on the left then in the discovery

1607
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,880
process on the right

1608
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,560
the client can send an additional

1609
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,400
resource lookup query

1610
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,320
to find where the authorization server

1611
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,719
is now this is not saving a lot

1612
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,159
when it's being done with link format

1613
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,320
but with the possible

1614
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:48,080
future extensions to the format also to

1615
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,799
the queries and especially with

1616
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,840
what might be possible with with coral

1617
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,800
queries

1618
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,480
uh so with the coral fetch format um

1619
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,440
there would be a lot to be saved here

1620
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,559
because then this

1621
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,559
could save another round trip

1622
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,760
next slide please

1623
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,159
so um one one thing that was missing

1624
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,199
from

1625
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,000
from dash o six was how the information

1626
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,440
actually gets

1627
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,679
there about the application groups

1628
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,320
because the group manager is set up

1629
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,719
to basically to just manage the security

1630
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,199
group

1631
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,440
and doesn't necessarily need to be aware

1632
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:27,599
of the application groups

1633
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,199
now in alignment with oscar group

1634
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,840
manager administration

1635
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,320
we describe how the group manager well

1636
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:35,040
that

1637
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:36,239
basically that describes that the group

1638
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,800
manager can be

1639
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,879
informed of the application groups that

1640
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,440
the security group would be later used

1641
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,040
for

1642
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:45,360
and this puts the group manager in a

1643
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,000
position to register these application

1644
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,799
groups

1645
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
as parameters on its joinery resource

1646
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,120
which are then

1647
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,520
used by the by the client to to actually

1648
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,519
find it

1649
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,840
there were also comments on topic of

1650
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,199
multiple security groups being

1651
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,840
associated with the same application

1652
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:06,239
group

1653
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:09,679
which we're not fully sure what the

1654
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:12,559
what um whether this would be used a lot

1655
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:13,120
at all but if it's used we now describe

1656
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,199
what it

1657
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:20,159
um how it can how it can work at all

1658
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,719
which is that um a server has to join

1659
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,159
all the

1660
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,320
all the groups associated with it

1661
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,440
because the client might be a bit more

1662
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,440
constrained and

1663
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:29,519
needs to pick one of those security

1664
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:31,120
groups because if it really if it were

1665
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,520
the other way around the client had to

1666
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,120
join

1667
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,199
all and the client would need additional

1668
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,960
information which it can't have because

1669
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,480
the security groups are

1670
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,199
essentially equivalent because they are

1671
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:44,839
all part of that application group

1672
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:48,239
next slide please so

1673
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:51,600
um yeah there's

1674
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:54,959
we do we are not done yet

1675
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:58,320
um we'll we still have to

1676
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:00,560
to add a few bits about how the

1677
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,679
um what metadata we can exchange of the

1678
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,239
group

1679
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,960
and there will be a few updates on based

1680
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:09,678
also on

1681
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:12,239
what is changing in rd-27

1682
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,920
we plan to give this a test run based on

1683
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,639
existing implementations of the resource

1684
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:17,120
directory

1685
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,920
and we'll hope to report outbreak from

1686
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,080
there

1687
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:22,080
in the next at the next session next

1688
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:29,840
slide please

1689
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:29,840
so thanks questions comments

1690
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,760
yeah i did have one question christian

1691
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,080
yep so that was basically on the the

1692
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:45,280
linking of the application groups to

1693
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:48,080
the security group so yeah

1694
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,120
it is an optional thing in a way that

1695
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:51,679
that you can also

1696
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:54,800
decide that the group energy does not

1697
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:57,199
know about any application groups or

1698
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:58,560
the thing is um if the group manager

1699
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,159
does not know

1700
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,679
someone needs to provide that

1701
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,599
information for the client

1702
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:06,400
because the clients will typically come

1703
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,360
in knowing their application group

1704
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:11,120
so if that information is not passed to

1705
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,639
the group manager

1706
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:16,159
then someone else can

1707
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:18,640
generally put it in the resource

1708
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:20,159
directory and register those statements

1709
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:22,640
about the join resource but

1710
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:24,159
then that someone else needs to get all

1711
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,040
the information from the

1712
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:28,480
group manager about where the actual

1713
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,080
join resource for that

1714
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,678
security group is and what its

1715
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,040
properties are and

1716
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,840
they would need to put that into

1717
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,400
resource directory so yes

1718
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,840
in in principle listen this doesn't need

1719
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,480
to be done by the group manager but it

1720
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,480
appears

1721
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:44,400
now that this is this would be the

1722
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,360
logical choice

1723
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,920
okay just because the clients will will

1724
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,280
discover

1725
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,400
everything uh including their

1726
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:54,719
application group they need to join

1727
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,920
so the clients would know the

1728
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:58,080
application group that's

1729
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:59,280
that would be basically part of part of

1730
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:03,040
the information they have

1731
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:04,719
yeah but whether that's provided by the

1732
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,880
group manager or some

1733
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,920
other party as long as the right link

1734
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,120
winds up in the resource directory

1735
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,320
they will care okay now i was thinking

1736
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:17,360
about cases where

1737
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:20,480
new groups get added later um

1738
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:20,960
but yeah that that's that just means

1739
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,639
that

1740
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:25,040
this information needs to be updated

1741
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:26,320
then in the resource directory

1742
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,800
at the moment that these groups are

1743
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:35,840
created for example yeah

1744
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:35,840
okay yeah

1745
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,120
christian i have a question i haven't

1746
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:48,799
read the document

1747
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:52,159
uh sorry for that it doesn't seem to be

1748
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:53,840
uh only

1749
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:56,400
tailored to oscar i mean like the

1750
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,600
basically this is authorization

1751
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:03,440
and so registration discovery

1752
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:06,480
of a servers on rd right it can be

1753
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:08,719
is very generic so this this very

1754
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,239
this very point of the very point of

1755
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:13,520
this slide yes this could

1756
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:15,919
be used in a more generic way and

1757
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,920
um quite frankly i'm i'm kind of still

1758
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,040
hoping that this is getting picked up in

1759
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,760
ace and then we can

1760
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,519
do what we did for the other uh for the

1761
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,520
art resource type on the interface

1762
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,640
and just say that and by the way they

1763
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,600
are saying how it is

1764
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,080
done and this could be used here as well

1765
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,760
um

1766
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,840
but right now this has not been picked

1767
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,000
up so

1768
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,760
so right now it's sitting here but yes

1769
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,440
this particular step is

1770
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,440
more general okay

1771
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:45,839
do we need any kind of communication in

1772
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,320
particular with ace

1773
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,440
uh i i'm not in contact at least with

1774
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,519
these

1775
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:52,559
people i uh maybe marco you are more

1776
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,400
more in contact with them

1777
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,800
but i'm wondering like is there

1778
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:00,239
something we can do marco and i to

1779
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:02,960
to help uh to to help

1780
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:04,159
for for a folks to pick this up it

1781
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:06,159
sounds like an important feature it's

1782
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,519
very it looks very useful actually

1783
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,000
because authorization is a recurring

1784
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:13,920
topic on on rd i guess we all have had

1785
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,880
issues with that several meetings ago it

1786
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,880
was mentioned

1787
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,880
already a possible connection with ace

1788
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:23,440
we can check again with daniel

1789
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,440
uh there's no particular rush anyway

1790
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,600
so christian what what do you want to be

1791
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:30,559
picked up by ace sort of what what draft

1792
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,320
and what type of

1793
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,760
change would you like the link relation

1794
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:37,679
so um

1795
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:40,480
if if ace could say that um

1796
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:43,840
one way of expressing that for accessing

1797
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:47,199
a particular resource you would need to

1798
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:49,040
get a token from this particular as and

1799
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:50,960
this relation is expressed with the link

1800
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,480
relation type authorization server

1801
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,840
whichever gets picked then that would be

1802
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,599
a small

1803
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,679
that would be the cool thing that i

1804
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,880
would ask ace to

1805
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:05,040
um to review or to specify

1806
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,719
and that would be would you see that as

1807
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,400
an update to the framework or is it like

1808
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,800
a separate draft just

1809
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,679
i think that i don't i don't see my way

1810
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,679
around

1811
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,760
the the various ace documents well not

1812
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:19,600
to answer that question okay okay

1813
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:22,080
fair enough carson go ahead

1814
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:23,760
yeah i think the most important part

1815
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:26,640
here is having the right security

1816
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:29,760
considerations around because

1817
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:32,000
most successful attacks on auth are

1818
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,679
based on confusing the parties

1819
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:39,280
as to who the authorization server is

1820
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:43,040
and we just added one more channel to

1821
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:44,239
to create confusion so i think it's

1822
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:48,080
really important

1823
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:50,959
that clients that rely

1824
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,320
rely on this information actually go

1825
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,000
through the right stops

1826
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,000
steps to validate them

1827
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:06,639
francesca go ahead

1828
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:09,679
yeah uh concerning ace i would say that

1829
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:13,920
this would be a different document

1830
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:16,400
and to answer what erin was saying um

1831
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,600
yeah i don't see how this could be fit

1832
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,839
into the framework

1833
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,120
right now but i think it really fits

1834
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:25,280
space and

1835
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,719
it would make sense to bring it there um

1836
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:31,440
maybe uh

1837
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:32,480
just one one more presentation and uh

1838
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,199
and

1839
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:35,199
get feedback

1840
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,840
all right thank you so um maybe to

1841
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,000
briefly um

1842
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,760
hook into what uh what carson said on

1843
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,639
the topic of authorization

1844
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,960
as i understand the the current um way

1845
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:54,639
that is proposed in ace is that

1846
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:56,320
the client contacts the server

1847
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:58,080
it gets back an error response that

1848
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,599
contains basically the same information

1849
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,000
just not encoded in link format but

1850
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,760
encoding

1851
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,719
something different but still

1852
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,400
unprotected and then acts on that which

1853
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:07,920
which is some which is at least

1854
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,280
something that we can take the security

1855
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:16,159
considerations from

1856
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:16,159
uh or bring to all right

1857
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,800
yeah yeah i was just about to say that i

1858
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,840
think there is actually time on the ace

1859
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,679
agenda so

1860
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,080
why don't you propose to bring this up

1861
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,080
tomorrow

1862
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,840
um

1863
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:43,530
um maybe you're muted carson

1864
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:45,440
well nobody told me that it was my time

1865
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:48,239
[Music]

1866
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,239
so um

1867
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,600
basically to to validate

1868
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,360
such an authorization server

1869
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,320
relationship

1870
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,320
the client

1871
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,520
if the validation of the the

1872
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:06,719
authorization server relationship

1873
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:10,400
is based on validating something

1874
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:11,920
from the server then of course a related

1875
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,759
question becomes

1876
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,600
how do you validate a server in the

1877
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,480
first place

1878
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,480
and um

1879
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:26,320
there are gaps in the

1880
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:29,440
authorization flows in the validation

1881
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:33,040
flows that

1882
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:35,839
are hard to to

1883
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,120
build a successful that make it hard to

1884
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,280
build a successful

1885
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,080
model because right now a client somehow

1886
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,280
has to know

1887
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:49,920
all this information or has to have

1888
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,000
a secret relationship to to some manager

1889
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,199
that actually helps it

1890
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,159
validate that information and we

1891
01:22:55,199 --> 01:23:00,159
we haven't really been talking about uh

1892
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:04,400
that part of the picture

1893
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:06,719
and that's actually where the ace actors

1894
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,599
document comes in and explains how to do

1895
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,000
that

1896
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,880
uh but that has been on hold for a long

1897
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,760
time and

1898
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:14,159
maybe it's time to actually resurrect

1899
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,520
that

1900
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:21,839
and complete uh

1901
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,840
the work on that

1902
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,080
yeah trust anchors are great uh hank i

1903
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:29,199
think

1904
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,199
said on the chat trust anchor stars

1905
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:32,559
but again whether a trust anchor

1906
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:36,799
actually provides you

1907
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:39,199
the right information to validate

1908
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:42,320
something specifically

1909
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:49,040
that requires more information than

1910
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:50,719
than just the trust anchor itself

1911
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,280
sounds a lot like i have to spend more

1912
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,280
time with these

1913
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,000
yeah yeah maybe actually it's one of the

1914
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,440
things

1915
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
that we need this iot ops group four

1916
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,960
because

1917
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,080
ace is kind of stuck in in the oauth

1918
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:09,120
past

1919
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:13,440
and uh we really need a more

1920
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:16,320
comprehensive view of authorization

1921
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,280
uh flows and i think the the onboarding

1922
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,960
discussion is

1923
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,840
a good source of of uh information

1924
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,920
in this uh environment we have had a bit

1925
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:27,360
of onboarding discussion in the think

1926
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:31,360
research group

1927
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:34,799
um and if uh io geops

1928
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:36,080
actually takes off uh that may be a good

1929
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,480
focal point for

1930
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:40,480
for getting that discussion going on

1931
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,040
um is there any informal meeting for iot

1932
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,919
ops this week

1933
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,920
just asking

1934
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,520
uh hank you want to share a stream or

1935
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,840
just go ahead go to the mic

1936
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,880
i'm just very clumsy with my mouse hi oh

1937
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,800
this is hank

1938
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:10,000
um no there is no formal iot ops

1939
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:13,760
meeting this week unfortunately

1940
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,120
it's a timing issue um there are isg

1941
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,080
meetings though so

1942
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,639
but but there will be a presentation on

1943
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:22,800
iot

1944
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:23,120
ops in the ops awg and rob will talk to

1945
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,920
that

1946
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,880
and i think that is a point where to ask

1947
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,600
questions about

1948
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:31,760
when where why and maybe this topic here

1949
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,239
please and i also can bring it up

1950
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:37,120
if nobody is joining unless conflicts i

1951
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:37,120
will do that of course

1952
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:42,719
thanks thanks a lot

1953
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:44,000
can people hear me actually the icon

1954
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,440
that shows the audio doesn't show

1955
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,320
anything at the moment

1956
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,040
can we hear you okay great so then we

1957
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,519
move to the

1958
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,880
uh thank you christian um i guess it's

1959
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,360
time to move to the next presentation

1960
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,840
i'm just checking the time and

1961
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:00,719
yeah i'm going to be carried away we are

1962
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:04,080
20 minutes late but we can still make it

1963
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,719
yeah next time i like it that is not

1964
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,719
rushed

1965
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,880
it's actually really good because we

1966
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,280
have more discussions and more

1967
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,080
comments so but anyways christian you

1968
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:14,480
are still on

1969
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,920
uh actually and i'll i'll in light of

1970
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,440
that i'll try to make it concise

1971
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,360
wherever i can

1972
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,480
no but no harry we have also two hours

1973
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,000
next next week so

1974
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:25,360
just make sure you present what you want

1975
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:28,159
to present not next week next friday

1976
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,759
this is this is about um sending

1977
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:32,239
multicast responses so

1978
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,520
and in particular notifications this is

1979
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:37,120
coming from the topic

1980
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,639
that um we have this asymmetry in

1981
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:40,320
where we can use multicast we can use

1982
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,760
multicast and requests and that's

1983
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:45,599
basically becoming very stable now

1984
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,880
but for responses we don't have anything

1985
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,480
and this has led to

1986
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,639
possibly seen this weird um

1987
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:55,120
constructions where the

1988
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:57,360
flow of the of what might be perceived

1989
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,760
as regular rest operations is inversed

1990
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,239
and

1991
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,040
we had to post some things just or put

1992
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,559
some things

1993
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,400
just in order to get them out to

1994
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,080
multiple devices

1995
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,400
and really this is not sparing us all

1996
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:10,320
those details of agreeing on something

1997
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,839
because if we post somewhere then they

1998
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,840
all have to be in a group and they'll

1999
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,960
have to have a resource

2000
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,800
um but we just haven't previously um

2001
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,040
tackled the topic of

2002
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,000
how do we do observations and the other

2003
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,880
uh how do we

2004
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,840
do requests kind of from a multicast

2005
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,600
source

2006
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:30,159
um in that we here we have to

2007
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,400
synchronize the top the token

2008
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:34,400
so multicast notifications is about

2009
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:37,440
adding multicast responses

2010
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,719
with a focus on on actual multicast

2011
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:42,159
notifications

2012
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:46,400
next slide please so

2013
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:49,280
um we introduce multicast responses we

2014
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,920
define how the token space here works in

2015
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:53,040
that

2016
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:54,960
it's still the client and the quotes

2017
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:57,600
um that's responsible for the token

2018
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,560
space but the client's a multicast group

2019
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,880
and the next best um delegation point

2020
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,679
there

2021
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,159
is the server with whom this group is

2022
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,040
talking

2023
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,719
because that's part of what fragments

2024
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,360
the token space

2025
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:12,960
so this is so the server is basically in

2026
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,040
charge of the tokens

2027
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:18,000
on behalf of the group of clients an

2028
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:21,040
extra next slide list

2029
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,159
how this actually works um is that

2030
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,840
the server sends the server

2031
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:27,440
sees that people are interested in the

2032
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,800
resource whether it's

2033
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,400
on the first whether it's by

2034
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:31,679
configuration or just when a threshold

2035
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:35,120
is crossed

2036
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:38,080
um creates an own request

2037
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,800
that it will then consider the consensus

2038
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,239
request or

2039
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,000
the configured request for that

2040
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:46,559
particular token

2041
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,600
send that do as if it sent that request

2042
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:52,960
stole that request and then start

2043
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,880
sending out responses to that imagine

2044
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,960
request that could never be serialized

2045
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:00,000
but that was imagined to have been sent

2046
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:02,080
from a multicast address

2047
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,920
when clients come in and try to observe

2048
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,480
this on unicast and the server is not

2049
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,320
inclined to answer them all individually

2050
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:10,239
it can send what we call an informative

2051
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:13,360
response and an error response

2052
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:14,879
so that the original kind of the the

2053
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,159
individual observation request is

2054
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,760
declined

2055
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,679
but in the error response there is

2056
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:23,199
information how to

2057
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,960
how to hook into the um the

2058
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:28,719
request that is already going on from

2059
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:31,520
the multicast group next slide please

2060
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:32,719
so since the dash 03 um we've updated

2061
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,280
the format of this

2062
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,400
response and really have been um

2063
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,040
converging

2064
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,879
on in one part of this design space so

2065
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:43,120
the design space ranges from

2066
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,880
we express we are kind of taking apart

2067
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:48,239
the whole co-op messages and then

2068
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:50,560
in older versions we've had um

2069
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:52,799
even particular co-op options expressed

2070
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,320
as fields in this response

2071
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,920
and on the other hand of the design

2072
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,880
space we have

2073
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,000
um basically the the whole co-op over

2074
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,280
udp message

2075
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,080
serialized inside this and what we are

2076
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,800
now using

2077
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,400
is what i think is the swiss sweet spot

2078
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:11,120
is that the

2079
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:14,159
request code and the options are all

2080
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:16,400
inside one co-op serialized by string

2081
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:18,480
which is very very similar to what is

2082
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,480
happening inside oscore and i think

2083
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:22,080
might come out as something like the

2084
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,360
transport agnostic

2085
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:28,320
form of the request and the response

2086
01:30:25,360 --> 01:30:30,239
and in addition we have one seabor array

2087
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:31,040
that encodes all the protocol specific

2088
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,959
details

2089
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,800
including in this ambiguous that allows

2090
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,600
us to use co-op

2091
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,360
over any other multicast transport that

2092
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:43,280
we might come up with that is not

2093
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,880
not udp and the details needed for that

2094
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:49,199
which are basically the

2095
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:51,600
the address and the port and the token

2096
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:53,919
are all encoded in here next slide

2097
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,920
please

2098
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,360
um oh i'll just skip over this two

2099
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:02,080
forward and come back to this i'm so too

2100
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,839
forward please

2101
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,800
the nice property about this new field

2102
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:11,440
is that we can make it work with proxies

2103
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:13,920
so um the um

2104
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:16,239
especially in the case of protect of

2105
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:19,280
oscar protected multicast so

2106
01:31:16,239 --> 01:31:20,159
in in in such a situation the proxy has

2107
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,360
no way of

2108
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:24,879
knowing what the what what's in that

2109
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:25,519
option because what's in the payload

2110
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,199
because it's

2111
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:31,520
encrypted and the client has to

2112
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:33,360
go through the proxy again and ask it to

2113
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,679
join that multicast group

2114
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:37,599
and the way we are proposing this is to

2115
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,840
use that very same

2116
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,239
um sybor array that includes all this

2117
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:45,040
transport specific information

2118
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,000
and send it along with the with the

2119
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:49,760
phantom request

2120
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:51,280
to the proxy again um this then allows

2121
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:53,679
the proxy to see that oh

2122
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:55,280
um this is another option uh this is a

2123
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,719
hub this is a

2124
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,880
this is an option that i have to

2125
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:59,920
understand and if it understands it it

2126
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,520
can then

2127
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:02,960
not send out the request because it

2128
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,920
would have to send it from the multicast

2129
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:07,760
address

2130
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:10,239
by the values in there and instead

2131
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,760
um join that multicast group and forward

2132
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:15,280
the responses

2133
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,760
to the to the original client

2134
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:18,320
and what i think is particularly neat

2135
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,480
about this

2136
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,880
is that the original client doesn't even

2137
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,360
have to be aware of what udp is so if

2138
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,280
say

2139
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,880
that original client is sitting in a web

2140
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:30,000
browser that's talking to a

2141
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:31,520
uh to a cross proxy via

2142
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:34,159
web sockets it probably has never heard

2143
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,600
of gdp um but it can take that

2144
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:37,120
information as it is

2145
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,639
pass it on to the proxy on the proxy

2146
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,080
will either do the right thing or say

2147
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,840
sorry i can do that for you

2148
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:47,199
um this just doesn't work

2149
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:48,400
so this is this is where this transport

2150
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:51,839
information

2151
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:55,599
is used again um

2152
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:58,320
two is live backlit

2153
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,719
so what else changed um since since dash

2154
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,759
uh

2155
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:04,480
since station four uh since dasho three

2156
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,880
um we've updated the mechanism that

2157
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,199
helps us

2158
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,880
that helps us um do the estimate of the

2159
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:13,919
number of active clients

2160
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:16,800
based on the suggestions from custom on

2161
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,440
comparing the last bits of something so

2162
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:22,159
we still go with randomness

2163
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:23,759
um because we don't necessarily have

2164
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:27,280
good client identifiers we can

2165
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:30,560
we can use um but now the

2166
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:32,559
the basically the factor that the

2167
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:35,199
um that the server uses to control how

2168
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,760
many responses it wants to get back

2169
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:39,199
is now expressed as an exponent thus

2170
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,880
much more compact and that's

2171
01:33:39,199 --> 01:33:42,559
also easier to compute for the client so

2172
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,800
we now have pseudocode in the

2173
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,639
appendices that describe how this can be

2174
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:50,320
done very easily with a

2175
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:53,920
client with a with an embedded device

2176
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:55,920
next slide please yeah

2177
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,520
i think i've largely mentioned

2178
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,920
everything that's that's relevant here

2179
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,719
yeah

2180
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,000
um when when proxies are used without

2181
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,760
entering security

2182
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,679
this whole process is a bit can be a bit

2183
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,679
more streamlined but with enter and

2184
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,280
security there is just no way for the

2185
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,320
proxy to look into the option

2186
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:13,679
in between so

2187
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,840
there there has to be some round

2188
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:16,719
tripping on the on the kind of on the

2189
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,040
downstream and

2190
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,000
involved that a lot that gives the proxy

2191
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,280
the information that

2192
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,280
originally passed through it

2193
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,320
to slide forward please

2194
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:32,320
so what are our open points uh one more

2195
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,440
place

2196
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,440
we we've just briefly after publicate uh

2197
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,040
after um submission we've noticed that

2198
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:40,960
there is still a few

2199
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,600
odd points around the proxy example so

2200
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,920
if you want to review this right now i'm

2201
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,159
we're happy to take your reviews but

2202
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:52,320
please be aware that the proxy examples

2203
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:54,320
probably need a bit of more work um

2204
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,000
we would like to tackle the questions in

2205
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:00,639
the next revisions

2206
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,000
of where and how we can negotiate about

2207
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:05,840
this

2208
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:08,320
was the main question being is there any

2209
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:08,960
is there any point in negotiating this

2210
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,759
if

2211
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,320
the only possible outcome is that no you

2212
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,119
can't

2213
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:16,719
you we can't use this anyway because if

2214
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:18,559
the server decides that it's too

2215
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,440
cumbersome for it to manage all those

2216
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,080
individuals

2217
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,360
um registrations uh all those individual

2218
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:26,400
observations

2219
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:28,880
and the client can't can't join a group

2220
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,638
then really those two will not find

2221
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,040
together

2222
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,280
um a probably easier point is the topic

2223
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,440
of whether or not the last notification

2224
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:40,159
needs to be in the informative response

2225
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,559
so right now it's mandatory we think

2226
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:43,199
about

2227
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,239
making it optional because that would

2228
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:46,719
roughly mimic

2229
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:47,839
what the what an observation over

2230
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:50,400
unicast looks like

2231
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,239
because you can get the response back

2232
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,480
immediately but you could just as well

2233
01:35:52,239 --> 01:35:55,440
receive an empty act and whenever the

2234
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:58,159
server gets

2235
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:59,440
new information which it can pass on it

2236
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:01,759
will actually do that

2237
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:04,559
and the first response will just have to

2238
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:07,920
wait a tad longer

2239
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:11,520
and finally um we do consider

2240
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:14,239
adding an appendix about how the

2241
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,960
server could be its own group manager

2242
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,959
because it

2243
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:18,719
really has all the information and this

2244
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,920
would allow streamlining the joining

2245
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,800
process a bit

2246
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,679
because the informative response could

2247
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,080
also include

2248
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,040
all the material that the client really

2249
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,040
needs to join

2250
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:31,119
in the monitor role it needs to have for

2251
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:34,159
this group

2252
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:35,360
and those are the points we also would

2253
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:37,440
could use a bit of feedback from the

2254
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,040
working group from

2255
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:41,119
other than that i think that next like

2256
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,600
this

2257
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,199
the the next steps are rather clear and

2258
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:47,840
we are still hoping for

2259
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:51,040
a few reviews that have been announced

2260
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:54,880
in the last itf meeting

2261
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:58,080
uh next slide so um thanks and um

2262
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,960
yeah any any input on especially the

2263
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:07,840
open points or

2264
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:07,840
anything and anything else

2265
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,960
[Music]

2266
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:22,159
are you least yeah we hear you well i

2267
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,600
have it on my to-do list

2268
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:26,320
to at least maybe do a review on this

2269
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,880
one

2270
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:34,239
um there is is there some urgency to it

2271
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,679
or um

2272
01:37:34,239 --> 01:37:40,400
no particular urgency i think um

2273
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,719
the the most important part of it to me

2274
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:44,080
is

2275
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:46,239
to make sure that the i mean to

2276
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:47,119
to ensure that we've converged on the

2277
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:50,879
understanding

2278
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:53,040
of the of the basic principles and

2279
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:54,320
to basically to not to not break this in

2280
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:59,119
other documents while

2281
01:37:54,320 --> 01:38:00,639
this while the rest of it is is growing

2282
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:02,239
but at some point also there will be the

2283
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,000
question of is this

2284
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:05,759
is this mature enough that the working

2285
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,560
group could think about

2286
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,560
uh taking it up

2287
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:14,000
esko uh are you is are you queuing or

2288
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,880
well i did have comments about but my

2289
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:20,959
audio was not connected so uh

2290
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:22,320
go ahead i think the question was on the

2291
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,280
last part so

2292
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,920
so was it the intention that the server

2293
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,840
becomes

2294
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,600
the group manager also for itself for

2295
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:33,600
its own group yes

2296
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:34,400
yes just just wondering does that have a

2297
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,600
specific

2298
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:40,400
advantage in this case um it's from

2299
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,800
so the thing is it would save a lot of

2300
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,080
of

2301
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,960
i mean that group would only be used

2302
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,400
between

2303
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:51,679
that server and the clients and

2304
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:53,280
might even be limited in terms of which

2305
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:55,440
resources on the server are accessible

2306
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:57,440
by this group so this is not something

2307
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,559
where there is any larger audience to

2308
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:00,480
this group than

2309
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,719
the audience of that server itself yeah

2310
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,400
it's just the group of the interested

2311
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,400
clients basically that need to get the

2312
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,480
observations yeah okay so thanks so if

2313
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,920
if there are external groups that

2314
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,879
um whose membership entails the

2315
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,360
privilege to

2316
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,480
you to view a set of resources on

2317
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,559
different servers

2318
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:19,519
those groups would be obvious candidates

2319
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:23,360
for

2320
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,719
this as well but um unless this is the

2321
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:28,080
case

2322
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:29,360
this might be kind of a shortcut option

2323
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:32,540
okay

2324
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,540
[Music]

2325
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,080
okay thank you christian any more

2326
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,080
comments

2327
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:46,880
right so

2328
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,880
oh francesca sorry

2329
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,480
let's go ahead francine

2330
01:39:50,960 --> 01:40:00,159
um um adoption

2331
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:00,159
question so

2332
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,199
do you mean adoption of multicast

2333
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:08,080
notifications or are we moving to the

2334
01:40:07,199 --> 01:40:10,638
next one

2335
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,400
um from my understanding please

2336
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:14,800
christian correct me if i'm wrong

2337
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,679
uh you still wanted a bit of another

2338
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:18,000
round to this

2339
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,679
before adoption right or did i

2340
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,960
misunderstand

2341
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:25,679
not necessarily so what if if there is

2342
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:27,360
if we have roth consensus on the basic

2343
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:31,040
workings which we haven't um

2344
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:32,480
touched in a while um then i think we

2345
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,639
this this would be an option from my

2346
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,320
point of view um

2347
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:38,560
there's a lot of details that still can

2348
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:40,320
be that still need to be hammered out

2349
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:43,440
but i don't see why this couldn't take

2350
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:43,440
place in the group as well

2351
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:48,799
so so just a disclaimer um because i

2352
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,920
don't know if it was clear obviously

2353
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:55,840
i'm one of the authors so

2354
01:40:51,920 --> 01:41:00,960
obviously i think that we should be

2355
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,960
and move forward and um

2356
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,000
yeah there was

2357
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:14,639
yeah that's a good point well we can

2358
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,440
um i guess we could we could uh marco

2359
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,000
please

2360
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:19,119
let me know if you agree or disagree i

2361
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,520
guess we could

2362
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:22,159
we didn't plan for for a specific show

2363
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,679
of hands

2364
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,159
today but we could uh do a a show hands

2365
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:29,520
on the

2366
01:41:26,159 --> 01:41:30,960
on the on the chat of miteko chat

2367
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,960
but not the chat but the application

2368
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:35,679
next to it and see how does the

2369
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,080
group feel uh for adopting this document

2370
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,960
now

2371
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:39,760
uh otherwise i my understanding was that

2372
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,199
there was no

2373
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:46,880
specific urgency on this one um

2374
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:48,719
no but i i agree

2375
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,239
as christian said there is no real

2376
01:41:48,719 --> 01:42:01,840
urgency but i think that

2377
01:41:50,239 --> 01:42:01,839
uh it will be good

2378
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:11,599
yes so we can do we can do uh um

2379
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:13,440
if it's okay with you francesca we could

2380
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:16,639
do a quick show of hands

2381
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,199
virtual hands on the on the miteko and

2382
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:20,080
like that

2383
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:21,360
without any confirmation i mean anything

2384
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,719
else would happen on the main list as

2385
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,199
well but at least we could get a feeling

2386
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,880
for

2387
01:42:23,199 --> 01:42:29,839
what the group thinks if that's okay

2388
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,840
with you

2389
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:47,519
marco uh yes i just before as an author

2390
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:50,560
i just agree with the other cultures

2391
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:51,600
yes of course there's a that's

2392
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,719
reasonable

2393
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,199
um okay how do we phrase the question

2394
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,400
like

2395
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:59,280
would the group be interested in

2396
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:02,480
adopting this document

2397
01:42:59,280 --> 01:43:02,480
i guess that's a good phrasing

2398
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,520
typing it now

2399
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:14,000
so um i'm gonna click a start session i

2400
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:14,559
guess everybody knows this show of hands

2401
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,159
tool is

2402
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:20,080
on the left from your chat panel it's a

2403
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:25,839
new feature so let's try it out

2404
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:25,840
i'm clicking it now

2405
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,239
it should appear on your on your on

2406
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:32,879
there so you just need to

2407
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:33,678
raise your hand if you agree do not

2408
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,920
raise your hand

2409
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:39,360
if you don't agree um as simple as that

2410
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,440
and i guess we can

2411
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,799
i don't know i don't have real-time

2412
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,559
feedback

2413
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,080
actually i do have real-time feedback i

2414
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:49,440

2420
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,280
main screen

2421

we see 11 raised hands that's already

2422
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:10,960
quite quite a number

2423
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:14,159

2424
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,840
not two okay by the way please feel free

2425
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:19,119
to

2426
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:22,639
voice any comments positive or negative

2427
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,639
for adoption of the document

2428
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,800
so are you going to ask the other

2429
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,000
questions like who's going to review and

2430
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,560
so on at this point

2431
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,199
yeah yeah i will do that and you already

2432
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,760
actually

2433
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:36,879
added as a reviewer in a way of a

2434
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,199
previous version

2435
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:42,080
or of the current version and so am i

2436
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:42,080
and so is joran

2437
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:47,119
so i guess in addition to those

2438
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:50,400
i will ask the question but let's finish

2439
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:53,920
the session i guess nobody else is

2440
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:55,920
raising the hand so we have 12

2441
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,199
like for the mini takers we have 12 that

2442
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:00,159
had

2443
01:44:57,199 --> 01:45:01,119
voiced positively for the adoption of

2444
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:03,360
the document

2445
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:05,360
and one that has possible is negatively

2446
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:08,960
out of 31 participants

2447
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:11,199
right now in in the meeting um

2448
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,719
so i guess this is pretty positive we

2449
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:16,239
can confirm in the

2450
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:17,600
uranus sorry go ahead please yeah i

2451
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:19,280
didn't want to interrupt i just wanted

2452
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,440
to ask what

2453
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:23,519
actually i didn't understand what it

2454
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:26,400
means to not raise your hand

2455
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:27,040
in a position to not not respond at all

2456
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,799
i didn't

2457
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:32,960
understand the difference no so uh

2458
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:33,840
yeah that's a good point the options

2459
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:35,360
available were

2460
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,119
to raise hand or not to raise hands so i

2461
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,519
guess race hand is pretty clear you are

2462
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:40,960
in favor of adopting a document you do

2463
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:43,360
not raise your hand

2464
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:44,719
uh or i guess you raise your hand

2465
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,759
negatively i don't even know actually

2466
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:47,920
what that means here

2467
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:49,280
that's a good point so i guess you can

2468
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,119
say that there is some people that are

2469
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,440
idle that don't even bother to click on

2470
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,440
the

2471
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,119
on the thing which is equivalent to not

2472
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,199
raising the hand in a way

2473
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:58,059
uh but we only look as usual to the

2474
01:45:57,199 --> 01:46:00,400
positive

2475
01:45:58,060 --> 01:46:03,600
[Music]

2476
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:05,040
show hands right so this is not a great

2477
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,679
tool for humming because

2478
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:08,960
i don't get a feeling or anything just

2479
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,920
another question

2480
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,199
like who does not want to adopt the

2481
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:16,239
document

2482
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:19,280
you could do that or just say um

2483
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:21,440
because there was one person who

2484
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:22,559
when you called the question you you

2485
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,119
said

2486
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,719
if you don't want to adopt it click do

2487
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:29,839
not raise your hand

2488
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:32,960
yeah so if if the person who

2489
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,080
clicked that meant i don't want to adopt

2490
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,960
it

2491
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:38,159
that person should please unmute and

2492
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:41,520
tell us what the

2493
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:43,440
objection is

2494
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,360
and that's probably the way to handle it

2495
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:47,599
at this point

2496
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:49,199
i can tell what what the issue was i

2497
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,840
just

2498
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:54,239
i did not read the document yet in that

2499
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:57,199
much detail so

2500
01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:58,799
yeah it was not the negative okay

2501
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:03,599
negative ratio hence

2502
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:03,600
it's just not raising the hand okay

2503
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,440
yeah thank you esco um okay we're still

2504
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:10,960
in the

2505
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:10,960
these comments in the queue you're on

2506
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,320
up okay carson then

2507
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,679
we probably don't need to go into detail

2508
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:25,119
about this

2509
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:27,600
slash race hand tool but i've had the

2510
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:30,880
discussion what that actually means

2511
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:33,040
in every meeting i've been in so far and

2512
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:36,000
i think it would be good to actually

2513
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:38,000
define it at some point in time

2514
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,600
yeah marco and i were practicing these

2515
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,920
tools yesterday but we actually didn't

2516
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,320
went

2517
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,159
so deep into details on the i mean we

2518
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:45,360
thought we we we nailed it and we knew

2519
01:47:44,159 --> 01:47:46,480
how it worked but actually in practice

2520
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,759
it's a bit different

2521
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,080
so anyways uh yesterday very suggested

2522
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,920
to

2523
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:57,519
to actually um ask the other question

2524
01:47:53,920 --> 01:48:01,760
do you not agree with adopting as well

2525
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:04,960
so essentially you have three by three

2526
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:07,440
ways to answer yeah yeah

2527
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:09,199
yeah i was just thinking about that but

2528
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:10,480
anyways i think i think basically we we

2529
01:48:09,199 --> 01:48:12,638
got mostly positive

2530
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:14,239
all positive comments comments uh with

2531
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:16,000
the with the

2532
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:18,559
with what esco just mentioned in the in

2533
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:21,840
the call so

2534
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,239
um i will need more reviewers uh i don't

2535
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,639
uh

2536
01:48:22,239 --> 01:48:25,839
so we we do have joran and carsten you'd

2537
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:28,320
be nice to have all the potential

2538
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,320
reviewers

2539
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:33,839
so please volunteers are needed

2540
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:41,360
esco you are unmuted do you want to

2541
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,360
volunteer or

2542
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:47,759
no that was not an intention but

2543
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,719
you can have me go to the list anyway so

2544
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,480
okay that's nice i

2545
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:52,000
will i will do that more often than if

2546
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,360
it is just about asking

2547
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:58,320
there is thomas in the queue actually

2548
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:59,920
thank you thomas thank you thank you

2549
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,920
okay i think that's enough uh

2550
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:03,119
we will we have some reviewers we have

2551
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:04,960
done the

2552
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:07,119
call in the in the meeting and we will

2553
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:08,800
have to confirm on the mailing list

2554
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:12,159
uh but it seems that everybody is

2555
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,159
interested on this document

2556
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,960
uh marco any well you are out co-author

2557
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:20,080
but you're also quarter so

2558
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:22,960
okay tomorrow so thank you christian

2559
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:23,920
uh this song yes thank you thank you

2560
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:27,360
both

2561
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:30,880
um let's move on we still have time

2562
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:32,639
uh 10 minutes more if i manage to make

2563
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:34,800
this thing work it should work for one

2564
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:37,920
more presentation

2565
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:41,440
yes okay

2566
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,880
so i guess francesca you'll be moved to

2567
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:46,000
friday if that's okay with you

2568
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:49,920
like right sorry for

2569
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,239
making you wait and

2570
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,679
we okay thank you and we moved to esco

2571
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:55,199
sorry uh

2572
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,239
it's hard to track the the chat and the

2573
01:49:55,199 --> 01:49:57,678
screening and everything at the same

2574
01:49:56,239 --> 01:50:00,879
time

2575
01:49:57,679 --> 01:50:03,360
there you go so let's go please go ahead

2576
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,599
yeah so this document is the group com

2577
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:10,239
proxy document

2578
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:13,040
next slide please

2579
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:16,638
yeah so the background of this is using

2580
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,639
the co-op group communication

2581
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:23,040
support and what we contribute here is

2582
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:25,199
more details on the description of how

2583
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:27,920
proxy operations can be done for group

2584
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:27,919
communication

2585
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,599
next slide please

2586
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:39,280
so recap of how this works there is a

2587
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:42,880
client sending a unicast

2588
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:45,040
request to the proxy and

2589
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,080
the proxy will translate that into a

2590
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,199
multicast

2591
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:50,840
group communication quest and the idea

2592
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:53,440
we have is that the client should

2593
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,679
indicate that it's interested in and

2594
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:57,360
capable of handling multiple responses

2595
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,560
and also how long the proxy should

2596
01:50:57,360 --> 01:51:00,400
collect

2597
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,480
and forward back responses because

2598
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:05,040
normally the client determines

2599
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:07,360
how long it listens for responses now

2600
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:10,480
that needs to be done by the proxy

2601
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:12,159
and we use a new car option for that

2602
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:13,759
the proxy will actually remove that

2603
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:15,920
option

2604
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:19,199
now the proxy gets back the responses

2605
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:23,119
from the origin surface

2606
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:25,119
and yeah it also includes for each of

2607
01:51:23,119 --> 01:51:27,519
these responses a new co-op option

2608
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:28,639
responds forwarding to indicate to the

2609
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,880
client

2610
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:33,760
which server responded so that it can

2611
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:36,000
distinguish the individual responses

2612
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:38,639
so it gets an ip address also from for

2613
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,800
each responding server

2614
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:43,040
and also here grouposcore can be used

2615
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,159
for end-to-end security

2616
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:49,440
and also possible is to use

2617
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:52,239
dtls or oscore security between

2618
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:55,040
the client and the proxy directly okay

2619
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:55,040
next slide please

2620
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:02,879
so the updates that we did was well

2621
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,400
editorial reorganization of the text for

2622
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:05,679
observation

2623
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:08,080
now there's some more dedicated

2624
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:11,280
subsections

2625
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:13,360
added there and

2626
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,040
yeah the observation is also explained

2627
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:16,480
in more in detail so the idea is that

2628
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:19,280
the proxy just keeps

2629
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:21,040
forwarding the notifications back until

2630
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:22,080
the observation terminates so this will

2631
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:26,000
extend beyond

2632
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:28,719
the yeah the time

2633
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,400
that is indicated for a normal responses

2634
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:34,159
collection so this will just

2635
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:37,199
persist basically until termination

2636
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:40,320
security considerations are updated

2637
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:43,678
also the new cop options have updated

2638
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:45,519
semantics and usage and uh

2639
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:49,360
one thing is that there's no description

2640
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,800
also how a chain of proxies would work

2641
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,280
so it's not not that different from a

2642
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,920
single proxy but we have a chain of

2643
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:58,080
multiple proxies that basically invoke

2644
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:00,320
other proxies until the last one

2645
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:04,000
sends the actual multicast request

2646
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:06,799
that's described in a bit of more detail

2647
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,800
okay next one

2648
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:14,000
now this is a description of the

2649
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:17,760
multicast signaling option

2650
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,400
that is used by the client to the proxy

2651
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,040
and there's a time value in there so

2652
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,719
this is

2653
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:25,360
indicating how long the proxy should

2654
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:27,760
forward back the responses

2655
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,960
and now a new thing added here is that

2656
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:32,639
the time value

2657
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:34,239
can also be zero so that means the proxy

2658
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:37,360
is basically

2659
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:39,440
waiting yeah zero time for collecting

2660
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:42,480
responses

2661
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:45,919
um so we figured this could be uh still

2662
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:47,360
useful to have so that's basically

2663
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,760
indicating

2664
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:51,598
to the proxy that there's no no need to

2665
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,320
forward vector responses but still the

2666
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:54,960
request

2667
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:55,519
will work and we also advise that it

2668
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,280
should

2669
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,719
be used together with the no response

2670
01:53:57,280 --> 01:54:01,759
option

2671
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:04,000
because ideally the server should not be

2672
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:05,280
sending those responses back if no one

2673
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,080
is interested

2674
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,759
to them but we wanted to still keep the

2675
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,480
option two options independent from each

2676
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:13,280
other not to

2677
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:14,239
entangle them too much so client if

2678
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,360
there's really some

2679
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:20,480
weird needs to it can also uh

2680
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,639
use it without a no response option

2681
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:23,759
so here we are also requesting feedback

2682
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,000
on so you can

2683
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,360
think on it during the presentation or

2684
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:30,400
later

2685
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:32,639
we can get back to it um next slide

2686
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:32,638
please

2687
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:38,000
yeah here's the response forwarding

2688
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:41,679
option so it's

2689
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:44,639
used from the proxy to the client

2690
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:45,840
typically so the client can use it to

2691
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:48,159
distinguish the

2692
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,320
responses and also the servers that

2693
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:52,480
we're sending those responses

2694
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:55,199
so sometimes you can basically get some

2695
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:56,718
information on the client already uh

2696
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:59,280
of course from the payload of the

2697
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:00,239
response or from the security context of

2698
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,880
it

2699
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:05,040
but this also is a basic way to to

2700
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,840
indicate to clients okay where where is

2701
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:09,040
this server

2702
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:11,040
what ip address did it respond from so

2703
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:14,639
that helps the client to

2704
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:17,599
be able to contact the server in unicast

2705
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,159
one to one if it wants to to either find

2706
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:21,520
a proxy

2707
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:24,239
or directly if possible

2708
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,880
so this format is now updated to have an

2709
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:29,119
address

2710
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:31,599
and optional port in the value

2711
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:34,559
and if the port is omitted then the

2712
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:36,560
default port is issued which is the

2713
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,719
yeah the same port as was the

2714
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,440
destination of the group request

2715
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:42,159
so that's the most common case so

2716
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,239
usually the

2717
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:48,719
report would be omitted then

2718
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:49,519
um before it used to be an absolute uri

2719
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:51,520
with the scheme

2720
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:53,040
and the host name and now we have made

2721
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,960
it smaller so that's a

2722
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,080
positive thing less and there's also

2723
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:58,840
less parsing to do

2724
01:55:56,080 --> 01:56:00,559
for the client useful for constraint

2725
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:03,440
lines

2726
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:05,679
yeah the downside is that it's not

2727
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:08,638
possible for the proxy anymore to to

2728
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:11,599
insert the dns hostname

2729
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:12,239
that could be done if it's uri so

2730
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:14,080
normally

2731
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:16,000
that wouldn't happen because the proxy

2732
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:17,840
will only know the ip address of the

2733
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,239
responders

2734
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:22,320
and why why using dns host name in that

2735
01:56:20,239 --> 01:56:24,080
case

2736
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:26,840
so this seems like a reasonable thing to

2737
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:29,440
do to to make it less

2738
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:31,920
generic so you can

2739
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,678
yeah also think about that for a while

2740
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:36,400
that's a question also to the group so

2741
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:38,480
can we live with it that it's less less

2742
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:42,159
generic but but still

2743
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:44,718
usable in i think almost all cases okay

2744
01:56:42,159 --> 01:56:44,719
next slide

2745
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,320
yeah this is about to support for a

2746
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:53,599
chain of proxies

2747
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:56,799
so what each portion will do it will

2748
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:58,960
if it there's a chain it will send the

2749
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:02,960
request onwards to configured

2750
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,760
proxy in the next hop and the last proxy

2751
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:05,440
that is

2752
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:07,360
actually not configured with the next

2753
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:09,598
hop proxy will will do the

2754
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:12,080
operation as intended so it will remove

2755
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:15,920
the multicast signaling option

2756
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,920
and send out the group request

2757
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:20,719
and in the draft we have some specific

2758
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:26,239
timing

2759
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:29,840
timing descriptions also related to that

2760
01:57:26,239 --> 01:57:30,559
so um yeah i think that there's no time

2761
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,080
to explain

2762
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:37,840
that in detail and the idea is that

2763
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:39,280
if the time runs out so suppose that

2764
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:40,639
there's a long chain of proxies for

2765
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:42,719
example

2766
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:44,880
or the client provided the two small

2767
01:57:42,719 --> 01:57:48,400
time value

2768
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:49,440
then proxy can reply with 5.05 proxy not

2769
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:52,480
supported

2770
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:55,440
and then it will also include

2771
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:56,480
the multicast signaling option in the

2772
01:57:55,440 --> 01:58:00,000
response

2773
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:01,839
but then indicating a time value that is

2774
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,320
acceptable

2775
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:04,960
that basically tells tells the client or

2776
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:07,840
the

2777
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,639
proxy before it what what minimum time

2778
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,119
value

2779
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:14,000
would be possible so that it still can

2780
01:58:11,119 --> 01:58:14,000
serve the request

2781
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:21,678
okay next slides

2782
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:24,320
yeah so this concludes the chain of

2783
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:26,480
proxy's uh explanation so

2784
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:28,639
responses go back each time to the

2785
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:32,080
previous hop

2786
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:34,159
and in this case only the

2787
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,599
yeah the last proxy so that's the one

2788
01:58:34,159 --> 01:58:38,480
that send out

2789
01:58:35,599 --> 01:58:40,320
the yeah basically the group request and

2790
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,799
gets the actual responses that will add

2791
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:44,559
the response forwarding options

2792
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,800
and these other proxies in the chain so

2793
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,119
that are before it

2794
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:51,920
do not alter or remove the response

2795
01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:51,920
forwarding option

2796
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,920
okay and then if we do that it will work

2797
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:57,920
next slide please

2798
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:07,040
yeah then we can have oscor also between

2799
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:09,919
clients and proxy

2800
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:10,880
and yeah that can at the same time

2801
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,199
coexist with

2802
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,840
grouposcore used between the clients and

2803
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:19,678
servers so that's the

2804
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:19,679
end-to-end usage coupon score

2805
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:26,480
and well we get some particular

2806
01:59:24,560 --> 01:59:28,639
processing things that come up if we do

2807
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,919
that so we need to treat for example

2808
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:32,880
some class u

2809
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:34,480
options that are unprotected now as

2810
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,920
class e

2811
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,919
and these are listed here

2812
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:44,400
and yeah there was a bit of a thing that

2813
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:45,679
could be more options in future co-op

2814
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,719
options that

2815
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:49,119
also need to be yeah i need to get the

2816
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:53,040
same

2817
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:54,480
treatment so a question that came up

2818
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:59,280
from this is well is there any

2819
01:59:54,480 --> 02:00:01,839
general rule to identify them so that

2820
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:03,519
yeah that you can basically know know

2821
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:06,400
already in advance

2822
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:08,000
specify okay which options need to be

2823
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:10,559
treated differently

2824
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,560
in this case

2825
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:17,199
so there's still uh no question here do

2826
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,199
we have any generic rules here

2827
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:22,719
can you hear me so yes um i'm just

2828
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:25,360
thinking that we are now on the hour

2829
02:00:22,719 --> 02:00:26,960
and um you have still there's still

2830
02:00:25,360 --> 02:00:28,960
quite a few slides right there's

2831
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,320
i don't know actually yeah well one or

2832
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,920
two we try to continue then

2833
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:33,920
sorry sorry then let's try to extend a

2834
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:34,239
bit more but just fyi like that we are

2835
02:00:33,920 --> 02:00:36,560
on the

2836
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:37,598
on the hour at the moment yeah we can

2837
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:39,280
continue also

2838
02:00:37,599 --> 02:00:41,199
next next friday too but you click go

2839
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:43,280
ahead and yeah we could take the

2840
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:46,638
maybe the questions uh to next friday

2841
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,639
also after our further questions

2842
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:51,280
and leave the discussion for friday as

2843
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:51,280
well

2844
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,440
okay maybe then the next slide uh just

2845
02:00:54,159 --> 02:00:58,799
see

2846
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:59,678
see if this was the last one no that was

2847
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,199
not yet the

2848
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:07,040
last one so here's a proposal uh here

2849
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:11,919
um so i think yeah we need to get

2850
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:11,920
get back to that later

2851
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:19,040
um let's see

2852
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,559
let's try to recall maybe next slide to

2853
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,760
see if

2854
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:27,599
we have a conclusion summary okay yeah

2855
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,920
so in summary uh we define

2856
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:31,360
proxy operations for co-op group

2857
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:34,400
communication and we define

2858
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:37,839
two new core options to

2859
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:37,839
have that working correctly

2860
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,320
and next steps that we have are well

2861
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:43,199
work on these open questions of course

2862
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:45,599
and

2863
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:47,119
also the idea was to define http header

2864
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,159
so that we can also

2865
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:53,360
tackle the use case of http to co-op

2866
02:01:50,159 --> 02:01:56,239
cross proxies so this would enable a hd

2867
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:57,598
client in unicast to basically talk to a

2868
02:01:56,239 --> 02:02:00,159
co-op group and get

2869
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:02,239
a collection of responses back from the

2870
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:04,159
group

2871
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:05,919
and then there's the need for reviews

2872
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:08,719
and

2873
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:10,800
i think uh we have also there promised

2874
02:02:08,719 --> 02:02:14,480
from an earlier meeting is

2875
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:16,840
christian carson and francesca

2876
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:18,159
but more of course would be welcome of

2877
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,560
course

2878
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:20,559
thank you

2879
02:02:21,360 --> 02:02:25,440
thank you esko i'm sorry for the pushing

2880
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:29,280
on the time

2881
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:29,280
um any comments any thoughts please

2882
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:34,800
we will extend the time just a couple of

2883
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:36,480
minutes more and then people are

2884
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,320
go ahead christian no need to raise your

2885
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,360
hand by the way like we can just go

2886
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:43,280
um on the on the topic of class due to

2887
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,598
class e option i think that would really

2888
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:46,080
be

2889
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:47,520
all options unless the proxy needs to

2890
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:49,519
understand them because it's

2891
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:50,880
it's up with the help by hop option so

2892
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,679
everything that comes

2893
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:55,840
this is this is not treating uh treating

2894
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:56,320
a message and then splitting it up into

2895
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,159
class you

2896
02:02:56,320 --> 02:03:00,080
can see this is really taking the whole

2897
02:02:58,159 --> 02:03:03,360
message unless something

2898
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:05,360
is really be needs to be unraveled

2899
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,559
by the time it passes through this hub

2900
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:09,920
with which is the

2901
02:03:06,560 --> 02:03:12,000
the help i hope that by help options

2902
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:12,960
so i think that it should be the general

2903
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,880
to

2904
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:19,280
include everything okay that sounds at

2905
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:22,880
least useful and it's clear

2906
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:22,880
what you need to protect them yeah

2907
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,840
all right before we get kicked off any

2908
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:29,839
