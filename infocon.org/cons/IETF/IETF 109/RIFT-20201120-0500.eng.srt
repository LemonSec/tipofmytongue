1
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,120
hear me now

2
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,120
yeah i can hear you

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,920
okay somehow my pieces

4
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:58,800
but this plugin mic works

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:01:01,519
i try to talk louder

6
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,038
so i think we can start at nine o'clock

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
so

8
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:10,000
high rift it's great to see

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,000
to be here and uh

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,679
it's atf-109 another virtual one

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,960
hopefully one before lost

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
uh we plan just to be reasonably short

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,839
meeting

14
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,039
everything is in motion and in process

15
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,759
uh we are going to go through not well

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
it's a reminder of itf policies by

17
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,280
participating in the atf you agree to

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,840
follow it f process policies

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,799
if anything is unclear the documents

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,000
that describe

21
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,759
how your contribution to atf is process

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,479
and policy is applicable

23
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,880
please go and read them if there's you

24
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
don't know

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,920
so agenda for today we'll be talking

26
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
about working group status and we'll

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,759
have updates on applicability draft

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,039
after that tony is going to talk about

29
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,439
what's going on in general without

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,439
slides

31
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
so working group status we have

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
submitted base back

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,599
to isd it's been

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,720
hanging around for quite some time

35
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,640
alvaro is planning to review asap

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,800
so we are looking forward to that

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
applicability statement draft is ready

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,720
for working group plus calls so we are

39
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,519
going to start one after atf

40
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
and young isn't going to work i believe

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,640
all comments have been

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
addressed and there's more work on

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,359
multicast on segment routing

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
we didn't really do anything and i

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
believe we will

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,840
start soon so bear with us

47
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,160
with that we are going to switch to the

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:03:05,840
applicabilities making draft and hear

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:10,560
what's new what's going on

50

[Music]

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840

i have a very short introduction of the

62
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
latest status of rift applicability

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
draft

64
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:02,720
version 3 on behalf of all

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,720

66
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,000
this is the agenda

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,238
i will talk about the updates since

68
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,720
ietf108

69
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,120
and the next steps um

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,440
[Music]

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,040
the total draft has 29 pages now and

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,800
the the main part of the draft chapter

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,800
2 chapter 3 and chapter 4.

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,440
chapter 2 is the problem statement of

75
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,880
routing in modern

76
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,240
ip fabric factory

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:49,360
chapter three analyzes applicability of

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,320
rift to cross ip fabrics

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
five use cases are included in chapter

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
three

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,800
and chapter 4 analyzes

82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:04,400
14 aspects of rift deployment

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,080
in 14 sections

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,400
so the con

85
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,400
contents are quite stable now

86
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,759
next page please

87
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,960
the updates from version

88
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,639
0 1 to version 0 0 3 are tables

89
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,840
and abbreviation consistency

90
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,479

thank you thank you

101
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:24,240
tony the monk is here's

102
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,199
here i am so sorry i didn't make up any

103
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,360
powerpoint

104
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,800
uh just i'm pressing and just a couple

105
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
of um

106
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,720
loose things that are going on so people

107
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
are hooked up so you know what community

108
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,199
is doing

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,400
um so we had another interrupt

110
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,440
with bruno very little

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,560
drama basically synced up newest version

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,319
he actually with the test he found

113
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,639
a bug i introduced which um

114
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,240
was cute i was basically disaggregating

115
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
in a situation where this aggregation

116
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
was not needed and my test didn't catch

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
it and he's tested

118
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,440
but there was another one-liner fix that

119
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,440
was pretty much the whole drama um

120
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,560
the italian university of roma is

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,360
actually building

122
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
now a very large scale simulation well

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,240
simulation actually you know

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,680
cloud deployment of containers of rift

125
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,199
i don't know how big they will go it

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
kind of depends how much resources they

127
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
can grab

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
so that's going on they had the paper i

129
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,160
the paper was

130
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,199
uh contested because the scale wasn't

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
big enough

132
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,319
so we'll see how far they stretch it so

133
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,440
there's active work there

134
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,479
if you're interested you know there have

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
a lot of

136
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
container tools and all kind of images

137
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,799
and they throw all kind of routing stuff

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,080
into complex topologies

139
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
um i will bring next time

140
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
and if somebody has cycles they want

141
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
something to

142
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,560
uh you know for to be rich and famous

143
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,599
quickly

144
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,919
we need a key value draft uh and i will

145
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,599
be bringing that stuff next time

146
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,280
to the itf and the reason is that

147
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,878
we are actually working and drinking

148
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,758
through some stuff that

149
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
i hope will present next time where we

150
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
can do something

151
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,680
pretty interesting ztp over rift and

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,039
to make that stuff interoperable we will

153
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,440
need a key value pair

154
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,680
store on which we kind of agree how stub

155
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,000
is in codec to an extent

156
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,520
so if you're interested in a key value

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,879
draft please see me

158
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,120
we'll talk about it the last thing on my

159
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
plate that was going on and it was very

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
active

161
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:32,240
is um a day one book

162
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,560
is about to be published um

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,519
uh mel here is synchronizing that if you

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
don't know mel here

165
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,360
he is probably on the call yeah melcher

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,880
is on the call

167
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,000
and it evolved into quite an extensive

168
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
list of authors

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
and quite a fat volume it was supposed

170
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,360
to be something small

171
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,199
i think melchior will be still glad if

172
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,800
he got some reviewers

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,720
and uh you know we we supposed to you

174
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,319
know publish it minus two months ago or

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
something like that so i'm pretty

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
confident next time here we have the

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,720

bruno

183
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,360
uh in terms of the open source

184
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,319

185
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,800
deployment

186
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,120
