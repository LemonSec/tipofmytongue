2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,559
so i have us right at the top of the

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,480
hour um we'll give just one more minute

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,960
see if anybody else comes on

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
and if not uh or even if so then we'll

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:31,840
in the meantime i'll share my screen or

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,840
part of my screen anyway

9
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:45,840
maybe i won't

10
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:59,840
there we go

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,000

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,840
the screen

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
but it seems like it stopped

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,360

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,679

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,520
but i don't see any new javascript

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
errors appearing when i do that

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,640

20
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,640
stuff to share with alessandra

21
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:44,640

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,560
uh but i ran into an interesting error i

27
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
will um i'll take a screenshot of it

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
and uh but i'm gonna have to drop off i

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,559

30
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
uh to get to share screen

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,599
hey tim i just saw you send audio ah

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,160
there we go

33
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,359
you see your slides need to be working

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
at least i'm using

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,080
chrome and and sharing one screen

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,440
one window actually only so this is

37
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
at least good

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,840
i'm sorry are you using firefox

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,119
yes right because i i understand the

40
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,959
sausage rolls are having problem with

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,560
firefox

42
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:53,280
interesting safari

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,239
safari the audio works um one note about

44
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,480
safari is that

45
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,920
if you share your screen in safari i

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,679
believe you have to share your entire

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,679
screen you can't choose an application

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,399
um i'm having a problem though i'm going

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:19,840
to drop off and

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:19,840
rejoin see if that works

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,520
thanks to everybody for joining um my

61
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,880
name is greg wood i'm with the itf llc

62
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,080
i have a

63
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,199
quick uh run down to

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,560
uh our quick script

65
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,600
interesting okay so maybe i ran i've run

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
into this issue again

67
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
i'm not able to share my screen with

68
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,119
firefox is that is that a known

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,120
issue now at this point

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,160
yeah it isn't but i think charles

71
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,720
transaction is experiencing the same

72
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,960
issue

73
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,280
so this there might be something going

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,359
on with firefox maybe with the

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,960
recent update of firefox because i'm

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
using firefox myself

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,520
and as i said two charts we

78
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,280
did test it from macos catalina

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,359
just a couple of days ago so i don't

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,638
know if there's just been

81
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,919
some updates that may have broken

82
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,240
something now

83
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,159
we will definitely look into that and if

84
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
we manage to reproduce it we'll

85
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,080
fix it but it's weird because i guess

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,159
that you actually shared

87
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,440
the screen with firefox earlier today

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
right craig

89
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,759
correct

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
which version of firefox are you using

91
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,639
um yeah i'm using 82.

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,360
um this is going to be difficult if i

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
can't share my screen so i'm i'm going

94
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
to try again with

95
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,560
um to join with chrome see if that fixes

96
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,840
it

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,400
so apologies for the delay i was using

98
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,159
uh or i

99
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,159
am using 82.0.2 that's what i'm using

100
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe i'll try with chrome also

101
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:14,479
okay maybe maybe third time is

102
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,120
okay maybe third time's a charm can

103
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,120
people hear me

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,520
yes we can hear you oh fantastic thank

105
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,360
you

106
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,198
and um alessandra if you wouldn't mind

107
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,400
changing my role to chair so i can share

108
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,400
that screen

109
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:45,680
okay fantastic

110
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,680
um let me try this again

111
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,080
okay excellent

112
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,079
um i get a little thing that says

113
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
your screen up yep it's coming up

114
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,199
yes i was getting a little thing on the

115
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,399
bottom right that says a screen is being

116
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,240
shared

117
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,160
yes yeah and there's a little bit delay

118
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
because you have to pick which window

119
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,480
um

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,880
yeah um and let me see if i can

121
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,519
adjust the size here to make it work

122
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,120
better

123
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,279

things sorted out here

127

128
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
first session

129
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
that we've noted and uh we have some

130
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,439
more uh

131
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,920

uh my name is greg wooden from itf llc i

133

morning

137
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,479
uh depending uh on your view of things

138

um the goal of the session is just to

139
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,079
get folks familiar with medical in case

140
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,240
you haven't used it before

141
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,599
to highlight some of the changes that

142
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,320
have been made since

143
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,279
atf 108 if you if you did use it during

144
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,680
that

145
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,880
and to provide an opportunity to ask

146
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,920
questions and to

147
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,360
try things out um uh for

148
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,240
session chairs in the upcoming meetings

149
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,079
in particular during the first session

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,880
earlier today

151
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,800
we had some time for people to try out

152
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
sharing their

153
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,199
screens and as we've already experienced

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,040
there can be some uh um

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,040
some bugs to work out with those so if

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,439
you if you're able to stick around

157
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,319
um i have a short script that i'm gonna

158
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
run through

159
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,800
just to highlight things some of it will

160
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,680
be

161
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,399
the same as you've seen in meet echo

162
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,279
before

163
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,160
some of some of it will be different and

164
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,680
i'll

165
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,279
pay special attention to point those out

166
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,160
when we get to those

167
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,959
parts that are different i'll also share

168
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,240

169
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,439
as you can see in uh this session i am

170
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,519
chair uh but um so you

171
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
so this is the view that you would the

172
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
view that i have is the view that you

173
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,239
would see when you join as chair

174
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
uh for your sessions and uh so you'll

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
get a chance to

176
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:25,439
um take a look at those um

177
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,800
just real quick uh here

178
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,240
and let's get that down there okay so

179
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,120
here's here are the topics that we'll

180
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,240
cover um

181
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,480
more there we go um so just

182
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
run through the documentation and

183
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,839
testing plans

184
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
um talk a little bit about the medical

185
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,560
requirements

186
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,839
uh talk about the joining the

187
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,880
sessions how that will work um

188
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,160
and uh how various things are tied into

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
data tracker

190
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,000
and then we'll run through the munico

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
window layout and again talk about some

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,519
of the features that are

193
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,440
a little bit different this time based

194
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,959
on feedback that we received after

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,279
after 108. um i'm just going to

196
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
pop out chat here to take a look and try

197
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,120
and track that as we go but

198
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,639
if i uh miss um

199
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,720
if i miss something or you have a

200
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,079
comment as we're going around please

201
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,839
um please just hop on in

202
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,959
so um there we go

203
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,959
okay um

204
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,760
so as we had last time there will be

205
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
web pages with a session chair guide

206
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
that will highlight some of the

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,279
specific roles and features or

208
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,240
capabilities and features that you'll

209
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,959
want to be sure to

210
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,440
use as a session chair we've got some

211
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,040
feedback this morning so

212
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
that'll be updated probably in the next

213
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,519
day or so

214
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,839
we also have a general medico you know

215
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,200
sort of a how-to for me to go in general

216
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,360
uh that's been updated since ietf 108

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
to talk about some of the features so

218
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,040
those two things are available

219
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
in addition there's a checklist for

220
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
chairs that you can

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,639
use to just to run through and make sure

222
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,959
you have things set up to

223
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,720
have your session run smoothly like

224
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,359
identifying a jabber

225
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,680
scribe in advance identifying someone to

226
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,839
take notes and so forth so

227
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,839
put pretty standard stuff um

228
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,560
yeah we have these two session uh

229
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,480
session chair sessions testing sessions

230
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,160
uh and in addition over the next 36

231
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
hours or so we'll have three sessions

232
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,600
for participants

233
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,839
on top of that during the meeting week

234
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
we'll have as we did last time the

235
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
ability for

236
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,160
session chairs to book

237
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,599
time slots so that they can um

238
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,839
they can test uh their setups on

239
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,880
um uh on meeting week in advance of

240
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,720
their sessions

241
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,120
um that was very helpful last time and

242
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:07,040
we're to do it again this time

243
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,040
and finally um there will be

244
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,959
testing sessions both 30 minutes before

245
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,680
and 30 minutes after

246
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,040
except for the last day of the meeting

247
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,000
but those sessions will be available for

248
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,199
anybody to just

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,519
drop in and try out their medical set up

250
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,000
before the sessions start on the day

251
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
and i'll probably be there and if there

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,839
are particular things that we want to

253
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,439
run through

254
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,000
that someone wants to run through we can

255
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,760
definitely do that then so

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,440
that's sort of a review of everything

257
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,360
that we um

258
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,760
expect to have ready uh to make sure

259
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
people are able to participate and run

260
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,639
sessions

261
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,480
smoothly during itf 109.

262
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,560
um let me just talk a little about the

263
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,600
joining the sessions flow which you've

264
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
already been through

265
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,800
uh if you're now here so congratulations

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
on that

267
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,040
um and you're familiar with this if you

268
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,399
um participated in 108 and that is

269
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,959
uh that is the blue sheets for sessions

270
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,399
are now

271
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,439
um uh generated automatically based

272
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,720
on um your data tracker

273
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,880
login so if you join a session uh

274
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,399
when you log in with data tracker the

275
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,199
it'll automatically generate the blue

276
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,560
sheet

277
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:25,199
um which is convenient uh one

278
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,638
upshot of that is that you are only able

279
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,439
to join

280
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,160
a single session or any particular

281
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
session

282
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,319
one time so you can't join from two

283
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
different browser windows into the same

284
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,040
session because

285
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,880
um your data tracker id

286
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,439
is is tied to your presence in that

287
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,000
session so you can only use that once

288
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,440
however you can join multiple sessions

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
uh using your data

290
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
tracker id in different browser windows

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,160
um

292
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,959
so uh that's one aspect of it the other

293
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
aspect is

294
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,239
um if you are a chair for a session you

295
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
will

296
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,240
uh you're the designated chair uh you

297
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,079
will

298
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,600
be um uh

299
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,359
joined to that session that you're

300
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,240
chairing as a chair in the chair roles

301
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
so you'll be able to

302
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,160
do all the things that a chair can do in

303
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,199
that role and um

304
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,839
in addition uh folks like uh the

305
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,959
responsible area directors for a session

306
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:27,040
will have um i believe the

307
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,599
chair privileges as well which means

308
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,439
i think i think it means just some

309
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,120
slight additional capabilities

310
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,000
um but they'll

311
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
they'll have those chair um capabilities

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,720
even though they'll be

313
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,800
listed as participants in the in the

314
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,800
uh participant list

315
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,320
yeah so uh with that

316
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
are there any questions about either of

317
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,639
those things before we start the tour of

318
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,759
midiko

319
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,880
and if you want to if you want to uh

320
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,520
you can test the join the queue function

321
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,199
by clicking the raise hand i see linda

322
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,799
so i see you in the queue linda

323
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
if you want to speak you can start

324
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,400
sending audio by clicking the microphone

325
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
with the little play button on it

326
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,039
go ahead linda so what about some

327
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
participants

328
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,199
who have contributions to two working

329
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,839
groups but

330
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,799
um they need to present at two places

331
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,799
how do they do that

332
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,960
how how do they present at two places

333
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,919
during the team

334
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,919
same time slot

335
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,200
is that the question

336
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,559
i'm sorry leonard could you restate you

337
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,679
state the question

338
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,678
i'm not sure i understood

339
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,360
if you want to speak again standing you

340
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,840
was asking that

341
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,600
question that you said and the answer is

342
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,399
that you can join two different sessions

343
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,600
but you can't

344
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,600
join the same session twice

345
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,600
yes that's correct that's right thank

346
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,520
you michael

347
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,719
yeah yeah

348
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,799
uh so linda i i i think that addresses

349
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,640
your question i'm gonna

350
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,400
remove you from the queue uh but if it

351
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,880
doesn't please join again

352
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
uh bob please go ahead you can press the

353
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,840
play

354
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,840
uh button on the microphone

355
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
same with if i wanted to send video does

356
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,760
that work

357
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,080
yes yep oh good okay

358
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,440
so yeah i think this is um there's

359
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
several things here i like

360
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,760
better than previous versions so good

361
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,240
job

362
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,240
so good thank you excellent

363
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,879
hey fred um yeah i just want to just

364
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
take a moment there are two differences

365
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,120
i think from

366
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,039
behavior from last time one is that um

367
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
anybody can send audio at any time

368
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,360
actually i'm not sure if that's the

369
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,280
change but

370
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,760
um uh their model is that if you want to

371
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,000
speak

372
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
at the microphone you should enter the

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,160
queue first and then

374
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,840
um and then be recognized and then speak

375
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,280
but it is always possible for you to

376
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,879
sort of stand up in the middle of the

377
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,240
room and just start shouting if that's

378
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,919
what you want to do so you don't there's

379
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
no requirement you can send audio at any

380
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,480
time even if you're not in the queue

381
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
one change is that i think anybody can

382
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,760
start

383
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,280
sending video without asking permission

384
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
and that that's a change from last time

385
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,360
so

386
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,840
uh with that fred please go ahead oh i

387
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,840
can't hear you fred

388
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,960
the phone button

389
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
can you can you say something to see if

390
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
we can hear you now

391
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,600
okay i see fred stepped out of the queue

392
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
uh

393
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,799
so um we'll come back though fred and

394
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,280
see if we can sort that out

395
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,280
um mike please go ahead

396
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,840
and you'll need to press the little

397
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
microphone with the play button on it

398
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,678
can you hear me yes perfect okay

399
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,080
thanks so last time at 108

400
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
when i joined my working group meeting

401
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
it came up as

402
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,520
my working group meetings as a chair he

403
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,600
didn't have my name

404
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,639
so is the change now like when i attend

405
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,959
other meetings

406
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
it the last time it continued to show

407
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,000
that i was the chair does it

408
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,840
go does it now go back to my name is

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
that

410
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,480
interesting uh maybe what i'll do now is

411
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
stop sharing my screen and then i

412
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,760
i'll restart to show you what i see and

413
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,520
we'll get this recursive effect because

414
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,480
i think we're kind of in that

415
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,000
in that time so um let me just do this

416
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,120
i'm sorry i'm not keeping up on chat

417
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,080
so i apologize yes

418
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,479
um pete does a disc glass i see pete

419
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,240
asks

420
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,559
a really interesting question which i'm

421
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,240
going to ask if we can

422
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,960
try a little experiment at the end here

423
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
uh which is for anyone who's left is to

424
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,919
um

425
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,199
have everybody send video all at once

426
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,240
because that's definitely something we

427
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,760
want to try out

428
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
so you should now see my screen which is

429
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,600
sort of a recursive effect on my

430
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,480
uh my miracle browser

431
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,918
and uh just to my to your question so

432
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,919
you can see in the upper left hand

433
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,240
corner my name with the chair role which

434
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,640
is

435
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,320
um what i was made and when you join

436
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
your session you should join in that

437
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
chair roll

438
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
and you can see also down here the

439
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,720
indication that i'm

440
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,360
the chair the only chair and you're a

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,200
participant um

442
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,280
two other just fine uh

443
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,360
finer details here is that you can see

444
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,918
that people in the queue are indicated

445
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,360
in yellow

446
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:07,440
people who have are sending audio are in

447
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,399
um green and um

448
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
you and i are both sending audio so uh

449
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,799
and then also you can tell that i'm

450
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,960
speaking

451
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,840
sending audio and speaking because you

452
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
can see the blue

453
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,720
pulsing on my avatar and also around my

454
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,719
video window so that's another

455
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
indication

456
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,080
so when you join a meeting where you're

457
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
not

458
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,439
the chair it will no longer say

459
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,880
um like like when i joined so i chair

460
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
the pym working group and so when i

461
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
joined it

462
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,439
it just said pim working group chair

463
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,000
instead of mike mcbride

464
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,280
but when i attended other meetings it

465
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,080
continued to say pim working group chair

466
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,600
as a participant and i just wanted to

467
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,720
know if that was still the case

468
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,120
for this time as well i didn't

469
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,400
i didn't hear about that maybe um my

470
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,000
understanding the expectation is you

471
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,880
will just be listed as participant as

472
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,320
you are now

473
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,480
and that you won't have the role

474
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,280
assigned to you as a chair if you're

475
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,240
disappointing

476
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,799
some other so if that comes up please um

477
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,799
let us know

478
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,320
okay uh well thanks mike i'm gonna i'm

479
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
gonna take you remove him in the queue

480
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
and

481
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,720
you'll see another feature where i can

482
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,799
click on your hand with the x

483
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,400
turning from the queue and also i can as

484
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,440
chair i can stop your audio

485
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,440
so i'm going to do that

486
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,039
i do see fred sending video but i'm

487
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,919
going to recognize david black since

488
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,919
he's next in the queue

489
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,159
having watched the first presidential

490
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,159
debate here do we have a mute button the

491
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,279
answer yes we do thank you

492
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,279
okay okay excellent uh

493
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,959
interesting use case for me to go

494
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,120
wouldn't it be uh michael please go

495
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
ahead

496
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,120
um right so um i like

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,840
the chat that comes detaches um it is

498
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,479
still weird that you can pick the chat

499
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,840
like you can have both two windows that

500
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
the chat's detached and the chat is not

501
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,360
detached

502
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,360
um and i guess they fixed one thing that

503
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,520
is good which wasn't so great in the

504
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,000
ripe is that if your window's not wide

505
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,559
enough

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,720
the the left-hand side gets narrow and

507
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,158
you don't see all the buttons

508
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,919
so i don't think that's an issue because

509
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,320
we don't have we don't have all the

510
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,480
other

511
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,439
we don't have as many buttons on the top

512
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,600
as reif did

513
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
like we have show of hands and chat and

514
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,158
participants list and right

515
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,840
right had like three more um they didn't

516
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,480
all get shown so that's that's really

517
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,320
good

518
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,760
um and i just thought i'd turn on my

519
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,279
video to see you know if we could break

520
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
it that's all

521
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,720
good and when i went video a video a

522
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,240
video how many can we

523
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,440
inside your infinite recursion

524
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
we should be able to break the video

525
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,720
much faster with the infinite recursion

526
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,360
shouldn't we

527
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,520
i i have no idea but um you know i'm

528
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,279
always willing to try things so bernard

529
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,039
is helping out that effort and bob this

530
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,000
looks like he's joining in

531
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
um any other any other questions michael

532
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,480
or

533
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,158
comments no i just turned it on to see

534
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,080
what it where how it happened

535
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna kick you out of

536
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,960
the queue then but you can

537
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,559
okay but i'm gonna keep talking until

538
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,279
you do that

539
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,960
okay you better click mute me yeah i'll

540
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,640
do that too there you go

541
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,159
now we can see you but we can't hear you

542
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,919
which is perfect

543
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,480
um bob please go ahead

544
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,279
do you want to say something just to

545
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,080
clarify

546
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,360
so the the procedure is someone a

547
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,960
participant

548
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,080
you know raises their hand and then

549
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,039
and we don't turn on their mic

550
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,439
they will turn on their mic yeah that's

551
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,158
right

552
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,760
um right the and video

553
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,679
procedures they raise their hand which

554
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,240
is equivalent to walking up into the

555
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
microphone queue and then when they're

556
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,480
recognized by

557
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,200
the chair then they may start speaking

558
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,520
and to do that um they need to click on

559
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
their own

560
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,840
you can okay so feedback for that

561
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,120
wait uh say it again please cheryl i

562
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,559
have a sticker but it would be very nice

563
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,918
to have a feedback so if you actually

564
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,480
could be you know clicking it

565
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,080
now he is recognized and he would see

566
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
that okay

567
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,559
like that then

568
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,799
uh i see so let's see so

569
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,799
maybe yeah just just a little visual

570
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,918
feedback mechanism there

571
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,600
yeah yeah yeah i mean turning on

572
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
someone's microphone let alone turning

573
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,399
on their video could be

574
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:55,520
exceedingly embarrassing well

575
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,159
well but when they did put their name in

576
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,559
the queue

577
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,919
so so right but you know you allow

578
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,279
someone to stop picking their nose

579
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,679
before they you know

580
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,679
actually get on and you know

581
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,960
greg when you muted me my video kept

582
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
going

583
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
yeah that's right i can kick you out of

584
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
yeah uh video independently but i didn't

585
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
want to lose

586
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,520
okay the video testing so you can see

587
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,279
here

588
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
you have as chair you have controls to

589
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,600
stop people's

590
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,279
uh different media streams um if someone

591
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,399
else were sharing their

592
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,480
uh desktop you you have to

593
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,320
stop them from sharing the desktop and

594
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,240
that's actually a point that i'll um

595
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
say now and then i do want to do a quick

596
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,880
tour of the interface

597
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,840
um maybe we hear fred now did we hear

598
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,880
you fred can you say something

599
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,080
uh hi something um excellent

600
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,320
we hear you nice job

601
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
okay well that's good now i know which

602
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:03,840
browser to use

603
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,840
not chrome definitely not chrome um

604
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,399
oh when i'm not sure how to mimic

605
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,639
what i heard when i was on chrome but it

606
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,639
was like

607
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,320
that kind of a sound

608
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,799
that's interesting don't know don't know

609
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,840
where that would be

610
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,520
but i'm glad you're here now um

611
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,360
i just want to say one thing about this

612
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,480
and then i see i think covered bob's

613
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,199
question so i'm going to

614
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,240
remove remove remove you from the cube

615
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
bob

616
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,279
and then linda i'll get to you in a

617
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,559
second uh one

618
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,760
finer detail is that only one

619
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,320
desktop can be shared at a time and you

620
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,440
must

621
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,480
stop sharing a desktop before the nest

622
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,440
next desktop can be shared so

623
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,720
even if you so for example pete if you

624
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,159
were to request

625
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,039
to share your desktop um even if i yes

626
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,000
so thank you

627
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
uh even if i were to grant that uh it

628
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
won't take

629
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,520
uh because as it says that it's already

630
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,080
that's there's only one slot for that

631
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120
media

632
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,840
and i have it at the moment so i'm gonna

633
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,479
thank you for playing along and i will

634
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,360
uh

635
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,880
stop that so um and with that i'll just

636
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,439
turn up to linda linda did you have a

637
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
question

638
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,080
please go ahead

639
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,200
you'll need to click on the

640
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,840
little microphone icon with the play

641
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,840
button on it

642
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
doesn't show you ascending audio vendor

643
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,399
um let me just show you this is this is

644
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,840
you should you should see this icon but

645
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,840
without play audio

646
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,480
okay um yes and i'm just catching up on

647
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,479
chat here

648
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,679
uh right when you when you want to

649
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,279
recognize someone's chair

650
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,520
they should be in the queue and then you

651
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,640
will need to

652
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,480
uh you'll need to ask them

653
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,159
so linda if you're having problems with

654
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,120
your audience

655
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,120
the queue is simply

656
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,799
it's raising your hand um quite

657
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,960
literally and

658
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,039
whether you start speaking or not is

659
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,360
entirely out of band

660
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,080
or that should be separately in band

661
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,639
yeah it is

662
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,399
it is literally a cue management that is

663
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,440
people lining up

664
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,479
and ah okay

665
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,399
uh linda if you click on the square

666
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,640
maybe start and stop it again um

667
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,439
maybe a browser sharing issue i think

668
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,720
because you're not

669
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,640
indicating as sending audio or even

670
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
trying so it's not a microphone thing

671
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,080
um uh linda

672
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,320
if we can't figure this out this session

673
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,600
we can definitely schedule a time

674
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,720
and okay great thank you um i just want

675
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
to make sure we get around because there

676
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
are some new features that i do

677
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
definitely want to hit um we've kind of

678
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,159
gone through

679
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,080
the join q which is just a hand raised

680
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:29,039
um sharing screens and video and

681
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,760
audio so we had a lot of hands-on

682
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,760
practical

683
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,799
explanation about that in the upper

684
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,640
right hand corner

685
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:39,840
uh we have the same um kind of the same

686
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,000
set of icons that we had before uh one

687
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,120
change is this we have a note taking

688
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,200
tool

689
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,479
and i'm not in gallery view so i can't

690
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,120
see what you're seeing but i

691
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,120
think you can see

692
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,120
this and for some reason my browsers do

693
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,279
not

694
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,760
usually give a preview of the kodi md

695
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,279
for this session but if i click in a new

696
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,399
tab

697
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,720
um it will share let's see what you're

698
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
seeing here

699
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,080
interesting if i

700
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,200
if i click on the note taking tool do

701
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,600
you see the kodi md pad for this

702
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,600
session

703
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:29,840
you see your tab yeah so if i'm

704
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:29,840
here now you see cody mb or no

705
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,039
a spinning ball that doesn't load

706
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,799
anything

707
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,799
unless i open the indie tab

708
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,320
interesting okay uh

709
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,399
let me just share my entire screen so

710
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,559
you can see what i'm seeing

711
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,559
i don't see the spinning ball um

712
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,279
so this is the code emd when i

713
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,120
originally

714
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,720
went there they were saying that okay so

715
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,678
here's something and then i clicked

716
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
there and then it's

717
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,039
i think the korean you know background

718
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,480
stuff but

719
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,879
yeah i can open it with that with a new

720
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,440
tab yeah i i can

721
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,600
i can i can actually see the cody md it

722
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,320
just went away but somebody was typing

723
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,918
into it

724
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,918
yeah because i'm popping around my

725
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,279
browser tabs and i'm sharing my entire

726
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,720
desktop so um yeah so i

727
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,080
i can i can see it okay

728
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,080
can you open it by the way

729
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,200
a new window and all seems good

730
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,120
okay yeah there's something uh

731
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,399
what should happen or what's expected to

732
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,600
happen is that you can see

733
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,439
the md in the

734
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
uh presentation mode which is what

735
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,080
you're seeing now but when you click on

736
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,320
the

737
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,040
um the notepad icon up here in the upper

738
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,000
right the code emd should appear in the

739
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,000
main window area

740
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,560
okay um

741
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,719
i'm just going to go quickly because

742
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,799
we're running through time here it's the

743
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,480
meeting materials the same as it

744
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,079
was last time there were no media

745
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,440
materials for the session

746
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,960
uh no agenda but if usually you see the

747
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,000
data tracker information here

748
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,679
so if you've uploaded slides

749
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,399
data tracker that information will

750
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,800
appear here uh with links to the

751
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,799
to the document of the slides um

752
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
the this is a tour uh of munico there

753
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,118
are some

754
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,560
notification settings which i think

755
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,720
there are some comments on

756
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,320
last time but it's just basically do you

757
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:58,078
want notifications for

758
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,560
uh new chats or uh for people trying to

759
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,680
share

760
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,359
media and then uh

761
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,118
lastly this is new you can change your

762
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,240
input devices while you're in the

763
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,440
session

764
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,279
so um i don't have any other

765
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,040
options on my setup but you you uh

766
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,800
you can do if you're if you're in a

767
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,240
session

768
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,119
and uh i said finally really when i

769
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,520
tried to change microphones mid-session

770
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,760
safari and need echo were not having a

771
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,960
good conversation

772
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,280
it complained about permissions i think

773
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,880
it doesn't re-ask for permission so you

774
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,880
have to reconnect audio to get it to

775
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:47,359
okay yeah interesting interaction

776
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,399
level uh permissions and um

777
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,160
and um medico

778
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,680
uh we can talk a little bit more about

779
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,440
that too

780
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,279
hear me now yeah yeah

781
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,960
managed to change the microphone to be

782
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,160
different microphone

783
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
uh okay fantastic it worked for you uh

784
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,920
last one is you this this looks like a

785
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,479
pencil sharpener to some people but it's

786
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,640
really an

787
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,880
open door so if you want to walk out

788
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,000
that open door uh this is the leave the

789
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,960
room so this is

790
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
the way to leave the session elegantly

791
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
so

792
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,119
linda i i see your hand again i just

793
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,880
wanted to uh

794
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:27,760
see if you could send audio now in the

795
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:33,520
new browser i guess

796
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,520
you'll have to click the microphone icon

797
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,640
okay i'm still not spending seen seeing

798
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,960
you send audio so

799
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,520
uh maybe we can troubleshoot this

800
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,520
offline

801
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,879
commission denied okay uh sorry about

802
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,520
that well

803
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,200
we'll definitely have to do this offline

804
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,960
i see people in the queue so

805
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,598
um i'm going to

806
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,240
uh go through the queue for the moment

807
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,680
still

808
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,919
we're only halfway around the world so

809
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,399
we'll continue to go bob did you want to

810
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,400
say something

811
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,480
and you're the thing you're sharing so

812
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,880
there's a button

813
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,480
to assume this is for chairs there's a

814
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
button that says mute all

815
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,960
and then mute audience what are those

816
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
the difference

817
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,240
yeah shoot sharp eyes there uh and uh

818
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
you're jumping ahead

819
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,359
it's good to call so as a chair you can

820
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,440
you

821
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:38,319
everybody including yours including uh

822
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,640
people in the queue uh but not your but

823
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,359
not

824
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,960
chairs not yourself so uh that's what

825
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,799
that button does if you want the quick

826
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,079
way to

827
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,640
maybe maybe this is to uh forget who

828
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,400
made the suggestion about the

829
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,560
presidential debates but this would be

830
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,920
new to everybody but the the chair

831
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
um you audiences uh everybody who's a

832
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
participant but

833
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,920
isn't in the queue so um in this case

834
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,520
uh we would be muting um uh pete's audio

835
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
if you were sending audio

836
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,280
uh and that's i think just in case

837
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,598
there's somebody from the floor who has

838
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,800
accidentally left their audio open you

839
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,079
can easily just

840
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
make sure that it's only people in the

841
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,839
queue who are sending audio

842
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,400
okay uh

843
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,280
[Music]

844
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,400
tara did you have a question yeah

845
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,240
actually i was thinking about that one

846
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,280
of the things i noticed that is actually

847
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,240
sometimes a little bit hard to see when

848
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,760
you are for example

849
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,359
if you left your microphone open or

850
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
something i see that yes there in the

851
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,920
top of the screen there is this screen

852
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,359
bar

853
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,680
telling but it would be actually nice to

854
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,880
have a bit more feedback that

855
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,240
do you have your audio and audio

856
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,560
video is very easy to see because

857
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,160
there's your video screen in the

858
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,759
screen but audio is much easier to

859
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,920
forget

860
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,440
yeah so there are two uh feedback

861
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,280
mechanisms uh

862
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,800
so first of all while you're speaking

863
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,280
you can see the bar graph underneath

864
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,839
your

865
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,839
name and you can see the indicator on

866
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,400
your avatar here and around your video

867
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,240
window

868
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
you may notice there's a pulsing

869
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,040
rectangle

870
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,160
when you stop

871
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,440
the green bar on your on your name

872
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,399
so that that is the indication um as i'm

873
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,560
still sending

874
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,720
um video and and sharing my screen

875
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,720
the

876
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,680
if you now click the mute audience it

877
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,240
will

878
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,520
silence the it will remove threads

879
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,560
microphone

880
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,400
but not mine or yours right yeah let's

881
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:48,320
see

882
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,040
yeah let's try it sorry fred there we go

883
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,240
so so the queue actually has some other

884
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,000
meaning than just you know

885
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,520
having a queue because it actually also

886
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,040
indicates that you are one of those that

887
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,040
are supposed to be talking

888
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,320
so i shouldn't be removing people from

889
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,079
the queue

890
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,160
immediately when they start speaking but

891
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,440
only after they have finished

892
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,480
their stuff yeah if you actually

893
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,640
kick me out from the queue does it

894
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,800
actually kill my audios

895
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,240
uh it should not no unless i do

896
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
something else so i can

897
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,078
try that but you're already right so it

898
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,920
doesn't kill my audio

899
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
yeah because i think that actually would

900
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,400
be something that would actually be

901
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,839
useful to be for the chairs because if

902
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,400
somebody has finished okay

903
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,160
okay now next person he can of course

904
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,280
come back with an audio immediately but

905
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,598
it could be you know making

906
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,880
sure that his you know audio gets turned

907
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,079
off automatically

908
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,240
okay uh

909
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,240
okay uh tim please go ahead

910
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,400
i'll even turn my video on there we go

911
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,160
um

912
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,760
i notice on the bottom of my screen just

913
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,040
like on the bottom of your screen

914
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,040
there's a little red thing saying

915
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,599
recording so um

916
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,640
you know to give the general er era of

917
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,480
paranoia

918
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,920
i'd like to know who's recording what so

919
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,520
is it being recorded at both ends

920
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,280
making a local recording on my computer

921
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,079
what what's up

922
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,520
yeah uh first of all apologies i should

923
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,960
have mentioned that right away

924
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,160
um this session is being recorded

925
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,680
um the idea is to share

926
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,520
at least one of the recordings of the

927
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,520
test sessions so that people who

928
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,160
couldn't make it can see the recording

929
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,200
if anybody on this session has a uh

930
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,359
concern about that

931
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,560
you can just email me directly and uh we

932
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,240
won't share this session

933
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,680
i did announce it in the previous

934
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,040
session when we started i just forgot

935
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,200
this time so sorry

936
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,720
um the recording is being made

937
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,720
in the cloud somewhere there's not a

938
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,000
local copy so it's a

939
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,919
cloud recording um and

940
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,800
uh as all itf meeting sessions are

941
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,839
recorded

942
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,520
um the recording is set to

943
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,759
start automatically so there's nothing

944
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,440
that you as a chair needs to do

945
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,480
need to do to record your session

946
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,920
and then of course those are made

947
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,920
available as part of the proceedings

948
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,919
cool uh thank you for asking that and

949
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,599
again

950
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,640
sorry for not pointing it out to start

951
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,560
um great okay bob

952
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,680
yes uh but you'll need to press

953
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,680
send because i muted you

954
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,640
can you hear me now yes okay

955
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,079
um so question so

956
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,160
we have about i don't know about 10

957
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,079
people here so what happens the

958
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,118
participant list when you have a hundred

959
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,440
people

960
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,200
assume it just scrolls down off the

961
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,560
bottom

962
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,399
that's right it scrolls down off the

963
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,240
bottom so is

964
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,119
are we going to get any but

965
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,919
so the you know the thing you know

966
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,280
whatever that

967
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,359
thing is that it shows that i'm talking

968
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,040
you can't won't be able to see that if

969
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:03,119
it's scrolled off the bottom is that

970
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,720
right

971
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,280
yeah i'm gonna go and you'll see the

972
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,480
scroll bar and you'll see what happens

973
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,839
you can still see it yeah i think

974
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,839
i think

975
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,319
or once you start sending sending media

976
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,319
i should say you're immediately speaking

977
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,640
does that make sense

978
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,640
wait so what what is the answer

979
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,040
so if a participant starts sending media

980
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,200
even if they're not in the queue they

981
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,400
pop towards the top of the participant

982
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,240
list so for example

983
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,240
uh you can see on my display tim is now

984
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,879
at the bottom of the participant list

985
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,640
but if he were to start sending media

986
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,599
either audio or video

987
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,078
it would pop to the top so he would be

988
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,440
very

989
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,720
very secret by the way greg i think

990
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,560
bob was asking okay the little um

991
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,480
uh thing that looks like a an audiogram

992
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,160
will that disappear if people start if

993
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,079
you start scrolling up and down

994
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,680
and the answer is no that's in a

995
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,920
stationary part

996
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,839
of the window the participant list

997
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:27,839
scrolls independently

998
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:30,078
uh no i actually was asking about the

999
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,960
we have an echo now but now the one the

1000
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,800
one

1001
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,319
on the person so i could see who you

1002
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,560
know if someone is speaking and they

1003
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,599
shouldn't be i

1004
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,599
i will well if it pops up to the top of

1005
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,599
the list then that's fine

1006
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,599
but that's what i was asking about

1007
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,160
because the bar bar graph thing is just

1008
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,760
for me i think

1009
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,319
yeah that's right you're you're just

1010
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,319
parker

1011
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,560
while they're on audio and i do want to

1012
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,240
just continue the tour a little bit

1013
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,960
um if people have problems with their

1014
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,359
audio

1015
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,079
um the reconnect button is a helpful

1016
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:11,119
tool sometimes it'll solve it right away

1017
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,560
um there's obviously you can the toggle

1018
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,560
audio means either

1019
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,759
means muting so you can still be sending

1020
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,000
but

1021
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,040
you'll mute yourself or i'm sorry use

1022
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,079
the feed to you

1023
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,359
not yourself but meet the few to you

1024
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,560
uh and this is the local

1025
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,000
the volume control basically and then

1026
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,560
this as tim pointed out this is the

1027
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,599
recording indicator

1028
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,078
and you can see bitrates for the audio

1029
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,079
in and out

1030
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,879
we talked a lot about this we've talked

1031
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,560
a lot about the chat panel

1032
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,400
the only thing we haven't talked about

1033
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,720
and i for sure want to get to is the

1034
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,960
show of hands tool

1035
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,959
um

1036
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,279
so the show of hands you people might

1037
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,720
remember the hum

1038
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,160
experimental hum tool from um

1039
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,200
so the feedback um that we got at the

1040
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,200
end of 108

1041
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
indicated that that wasn't as useful as

1042
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,480
um

1043
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,200
we thought it might be and so as an

1044
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,760
experiment decided not to continue it

1045
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,680
but there was feedback that it would be

1046
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,640
uh useful to be able to get some

1047
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,040
indication

1048
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:26,400
of people uh as a yes no kind of

1049
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,279
uh feedback so asking a question like

1050
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,560
you know who here has read the draft or

1051
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,760
something like that

1052
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,440
um so this tool is intended to um

1053
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,880
replicate that kind of in-person

1054
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,760
feedback that you might get in that

1055
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,440
in a meeting room and um there are a few

1056
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,960
other subtle differences

1057
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,560
well maybe not subtle but a few other

1058
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,359
differences from the experimental home

1059
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,078
tool

1060
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:48,480
one is that um you can type a question

1061
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
here

1062
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,440
so like uh

1063
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,800
have you read the draft and then

1064
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,119
you can start that question you should

1065
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
get an indication that as you see that a

1066
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,319
new

1067
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,000
question has been raised you can see the

1068
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,000
text that i typed at the top of that

1069
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,440
question and you can see that

1070
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,599
you have the option to

1071
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,040
positively or affirmatively raise your

1072
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,960
hand or affirmatively

1073
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:24,240
not raise your hand and the idea there

1074
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,839
is that uh

1075
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,359
this is a way for people to indicate

1076
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,040
that they're listening to the question

1077
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,598
and that they want to raise their hand

1078
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,480
and

1079
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,200
that uh or they've heard the question

1080
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,480
but they

1081
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,480
don't want to raise their hand

1082
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,880
so you can tell by the difference

1083
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,640
between those two things

1084
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,240
and the participant number you can tell

1085
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,759
that we have

1086
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,439
about eight people who are listening and

1087
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,680
three people who are not

1088
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:57,280
um and as i see the numbers changing

1089
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,440
you can change your mind so uh

1090
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,480
at some point uh you as chair can just

1091
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,800
end that question

1092
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,520
which i'll do um i didn't see that on my

1093
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,720
god on yours but that's why i've seen

1094
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,200
that

1095
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,480
no as a chair only as a chair do you see

1096
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,480
the option to end the session

1097
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,000
i didn't see i could see the show of

1098
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,598
hands being on your screen but it didn't

1099
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,160
come up on mine

1100
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,160
oh so i have to go to the tab

1101
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,160
that's actually i think it will very

1102
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,800
useful to automatically switch to that

1103
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,960
tab

1104
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,400
when there is a question i was going to

1105
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,440
say the same thing that would be really

1106
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,040
good to push that

1107
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,040
out to everyone

1108
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:52,000
okay so uh i'm doing this

1109
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,000
uh

1110
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,640
it does turn out that you need to think

1111
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,160
a little bit about how you write the

1112
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,480
question at least for me it's not always

1113
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,879
natural

1114
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,800
uh to write the question in a way that

1115
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,800
sends yourself to raise a hand kind of

1116
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:12,640
thing um so you should see uh indication

1117
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,359
in the lower right that a new

1118
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,720
thing has started but as chair you may

1119
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,640
need to

1120
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,399
prompt since we don't have the auto

1121
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,680
switch thing at the moment

1122
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,720
to get people to raise their hand

1123
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,480
so if you think we should

1124
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
auto switch the tab please raise your

1125
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,920
hand now if you think we should

1126
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,920
not please keep your hand down

1127
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,479
okay so uh useful feedback here it looks

1128
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,000
like

1129
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,160
the majority of people in this session

1130
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,839
think we should auto switch the tab

1131
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:48,240
uh they don't have uh and we have

1132
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,440
at least three people who are either not

1133
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,959
listening or don't care

1134
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:56,079
so that's good feedback as we

1135
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,960
plan to do that advise people to detach

1136
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,040
the chat

1137
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,400
because almost what you're waiting chat

1138
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,000
is going to surprise people

1139
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,319
which ones and other things are probably

1140
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,319
okay

1141
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,520
could you say that again i didn't quite

1142
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:12,480
get the last bit

1143
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,920
um that window where the tab is is also

1144
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,520
a window where the chat

1145
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,119
is yes if you advise people to auto

1146
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:23,040
to detach the chat so that the chat is

1147
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,319
not in a window that will banish the

1148
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,880
auto switch

1149
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,520
you will avoid pulling people out of

1150
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,280
chat

1151
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,119
when you when you start a handwriting so

1152
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,760
if you're planning to do a hand raise

1153
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,599
and it's going to cause auto switch

1154
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,040
you probably want to advise your your

1155
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,480
participants

1156
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,240
at the start of the meeting to detach

1157
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,559
the chat for that reason

1158
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,479
because it's a better experience yeah

1159
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,920
and we'll uh that's a good point and

1160
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,680
we'll definitely highlight that feature

1161
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,760
in the um

1162
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:54,960
uh in the testing sessions um

1163
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,800
and for example it's helpful because

1164
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,920
uh the detached chat is table because

1165
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,839
then you can always keep an eye on the

1166
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,280
participant list which is

1167
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,599
one of the main pieces of feedback that

1168
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,680
we got as well so yeah good point thank

1169
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,680
you

1170
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,078
uh michael you still have your hand

1171
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,079
raised is that

1172
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,520
okay just want to check i wanted to

1173
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,800
complain

1174
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,000
uh now that we've had enough people that

1175
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,000
they um uh the fact that as you scroll

1176
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,200
across people's names it shows up this

1177
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,760
chat button and then

1178
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,399
re bounces all the other names up and

1179
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,559
down

1180
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,160
it's really annoying and particularly

1181
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,839
since the most obvious thing if you want

1182
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,640
to see the thing is you put your mouse

1183
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,960
into that

1184
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,759
area and then you scroll your trolley

1185
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,440
wheel

1186
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,119
to see the people at the bottom at which

1187
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,680
point everything bounces around and you

1188
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,480
can

1189
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,200
anyway and you can't even when is it

1190
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,800
trying to click

1191
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,480
as a chair i would that would probably

1192
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,559
bought where you might be able to

1193
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,079
cancel people's stuff that would buy

1194
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,480
these bonkers and i'd probably want to

1195
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:54,079
click

1196
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,400
you know taking the wrong person out or

1197
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,040
something nice um

1198
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,880
so i like the chat button but i don't

1199
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,839
like that it opens up this other

1200
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:05,680
box below i tried making my window wider

1201
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,279
to see if maybe it was just me that it

1202
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,240
would wind up to the right

1203
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,839
um but no that didn't help i have only

1204
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,680
like the whole thing in a quarter of my

1205
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,400
screen right the right hand

1206
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,598
uh one quarter of my two screens so that

1207
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,200
i have space for the chat

1208
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,160
and the jabber and the slides and the

1209
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,118
whatever yeah okay that's uh that's a

1210
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,480
good fine point

1211
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:28,480
thank you uh tyra

1212
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,400
one of the things i was actually doing

1213
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,000
is actually as i said there is

1214
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,920
in in some of those browsers if you

1215
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,720
right click on the video for example

1216
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,559
your

1217
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,319
own screen i don't know if it works for

1218
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,240
you but if you right click on that it

1219
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:47,839
says a picture in picture somewhere

1220
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,839
and actually you know the video screen

1221
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,520
but if you have that has a picture in

1222
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,960
picture where you can actually detach

1223
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,839
for example the screen that you are

1224
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,520
sharing

1225
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:02,799
and then you can use gallery view so i

1226
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:04,480
have actually you know everybody's

1227
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,559
video video feeds and then i have a

1228
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,520
separate window for

1229
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,200
for the slides well that really works

1230
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,720
that really works tarot

1231
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,118
although you get the video actually it's

1232
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:17,040
one of the best ways of doing this

1233
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,880
because one of the problems is that this

1234
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,680
you know screen sharing is taking lots

1235
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,960
of space

1236
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,279
if you're using it in inside the screen

1237
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,480
yeah one thing we hopped right over was

1238
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,800
the um

1239
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,760
ability to do gallery view and notice

1240
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,839
that we're coming to just

1241
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,839
the top of the so this is a different

1242
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,078
way to see all the video and if you can

1243
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:39,359
detach the shared screen then

1244
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,480
uh i i don't know if it still works but

1245
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:45,359
um yeah

1246
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,480
um okay if you actually allow me to

1247
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:48,720
share my screen i

1248
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,680
can show you what what i have currently

1249
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,439
yeah okay

1250
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,879
let me stop mine and then if you request

1251
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,839
your sharing i can

1252
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,839
do that i've accepted that

1253
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,079
uh but your audio seems to have stopped

1254
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,598
i don't know why

1255
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:13,280
so it looks like there we go okay

1256
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:16,720
okay sharing now yeah my

1257
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,760
detached uh non gallery view is blank

1258
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,759
now

1259
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,800
yeah it's actually it sends the video so

1260
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,880
you need to reach

1261
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,000
you need to do it again so this is what

1262
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,839
i have now

1263
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,720
so this is my window that has you know

1264
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:31,839
all the videos this is my search screen

1265
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,680
or the slides yeah you know

1266
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,920
the right uh right side that i have a

1267
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,680
chat there and so so i can

1268
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,319
move all of these around i can make this

1269
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,839
bigger if i want

1270
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:43,440
all the drawings oh it's actually the

1271
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:46,078
limit to how big there's a limit to how

1272
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,200
big it would make it for me

1273
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,520
yeah that's actually true probably the

1274
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,160
resolution of the oh no actually it

1275
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,160
can't i don't know

1276
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,440
but that's nice

1277
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,520
yeah so we're diving very deep that's

1278
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,559
great thank you

1279
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:07,680
um i just wanted to say fred

1280
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,119
you know uh just make sure you saw that

1281
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,759
raised hand i'm going to share my screen

1282
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,119
again uh

1283
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,119
i'll just uh

1284
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,240
there we go so the raised hand feature

1285
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,880
is

1286
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,919
you should see it says join q right if

1287
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,920
you can see my screen now

1288
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,799
um

1289
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,440
so okay it's the

1290
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,799
the thing that looks like a hand being

1291
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,480
raised

1292
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:40,559
yes it has the hand like that or maybe

1293
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,799
the other hand the other way and it's

1294
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,559
got little two little up arrows

1295
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,000
so you click on that hand you'll join

1296
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,359
the cue

1297
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,880
see myself um so that's actually a good

1298
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,839
point as a chair you can put yourself in

1299
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:54,079
the queue

1300
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,078
so uh if i take myself out of the queue

1301
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,880
then i come in the back

1302
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,240
at the end of the queue i see fred is

1303
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,359
dropped out of the queue i see michael

1304
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,319
in the queue again

1305
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,319
did you have a comment mike

1306
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,000
you have to press the send just like to

1307
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,280
make it go

1308
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
and and see it go add and subtract after

1309
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,359
all the

1310
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,280
infinite recursion i see okay

1311
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:23,440
there you go nice um

1312
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,640
so i think you're telling me that

1313
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,760
joining the queue

1314
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,400
saying i would like to talk is the same

1315
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,359
button

1316
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,839
as yes i would agree with whatever

1317
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,480
statement

1318
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,480
somebody made

1319
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,680
no it's uh they're not separate buttons

1320
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,200
they are separate buttons um uh they are

1321
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:47,040
they are uh the agree with the statement

1322
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,279
is the show of hands tool which i'm

1323
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,319
which i'm mousing over right now so it's

1324
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,319
a separate tab

1325
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:59,839
here and um

1326
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,399
so you can see that you have to go to

1327
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,920
that tab you should get a notification

1328
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,480
to go to the tab but if you click on

1329
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
that

1330
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,599
little bar graph tab you'll have the

1331
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,599
option to have

1332
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,760
sort of a radio button choice between

1333
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:19,119
raising your hand if you like chocolate

1334
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,119
or you're not raising your hand

1335
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,520
yeah there's no there's no independent

1336
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,959
always

1337
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:31,680
available button to give a big okay or

1338
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,680
thumbs up or whatever right right

1339
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:40,319
okay so somebody would want to have a

1340
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:43,440
plus one button

1341
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:48,160
yeah yeah i think

1342
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:52,160
uh yeah okay hang on my audio and

1343
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:55,279
waving excitedly that's that's fine

1344
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,799
thanks for stopping by tim i think

1345
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,799
uh you're on your way out um

1346
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,799
we have three minutes left uh in the

1347
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,480
hour that uh i think we had a lot of i'm

1348
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,960
happy to stay after by the way

1349
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,000
if people want to test things but with

1350
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,480
the people that are still

1351
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,880
here i wonder if we could try turning on

1352
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,880
the video

1353
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,879
that test test anybody who's willing

1354
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:22,960
anymore

1355
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:26,640
and i'm gonna go to the gallery

1356
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,160
good to see everybody alessandro

1357
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,960
might be asleep because it's in the

1358
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,960
middle of the night

1359
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,799
oh there's a white red's here okay we

1360
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,640
have nine streams that's

1361
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:40,400
that's good i think that's the most i've

1362
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:45,440
ever seen

1363
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,799
so awesome you all look fantastic

1364
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,920
thank you very much no apparent

1365
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,920
degradation in

1366
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,960
well yeah if everybody in the plenary

1367
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,440
turned on that might be a little

1368
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,440
exciting

1369
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:29,839
so my thing i've noticed is that the fan

1370
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,720
on my laptop is running

1371
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,400
but uh it seems like it's still helpful

1372
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,680
to use a headset

1373
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,720
because to avoid echo is that

1374
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,200
yeah and i'm i'm i'm not listening to

1375
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,879
the owner

1376
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,480
my own advice but yeah that's for sure

1377
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,880
one of the very first tips that we give

1378
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,480
in the

1379
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,960
documentation so

1380
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,400
audio greg sounds actually pretty good i

1381
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,599
i get the sense that mine is echoey

1382
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,319
okay okay i was trying to watch the

1383
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,480
bubbles

1384
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,520
to see if i could catch whose system was

1385
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,280
echoing

1386
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:10,319
and i couldn't see it was too short so

1387
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,319
um i wonder if there is any thought to

1388
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,000
a longer decay maybe so we could see

1389
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,079
that and me

1390
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,960
and kick and mute the right person who's

1391
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,960
generating echo

1392
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,640
that uh that seems like a pretty

1393
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,680
that's a that's a that's a very high

1394
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,480
level idea i'm

1395
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,359
it's over beyond my capability i'm i'm

1396
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,400
going to stick with

1397
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,040
use headset but uh or just you know

1398
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,799
the chair can youth audience you know

1399
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:43,279
all the keychains that are in the

1400
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:46,799
in the queue yeah yeah that's right

1401
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,119
yeah and by the way one useful uh hint

1402
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,759
uh maybe if somebody is not wearing

1403
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,240
headsets and you hear echo

1404
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,079
one suggestion could be to just keep

1405
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,000
talking for a while because the echo

1406
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,319
cancer the browser echo cancer

1407
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,200
takes a little while to kick in so if

1408
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,319
you stop

1409
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:07,439
as soon as you hear echo basically the

1410
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,839
echo cancer cannot do its job it just

1411
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,480
so if you keep on talking the echo

1412
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:13,920
cancer

1413
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,799
should cancel the echo and it dries at

1414
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,799
least

1415
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:18,240
is it the echo canceller my browser the

1416
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,160
echo council or the guy who's not

1417
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,319
wearing the headset

1418
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,359
it's the echo counselor of the guy who's

1419
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,400
not wearing the answer

1420
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:26,400
yeah right okay

1421
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,279
okay i i love these things i learned

1422
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,558
something new every time

1423
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,880
um was that also the reason why you say

1424
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,359
that we shouldn't be using the

1425
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,799
my um use box button in your microphone

1426
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:42,480
like i have this

1427
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,480
turning up it actually which is the

1428
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,040
microphone i but if you just

1429
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,880
you know not use that is that you know

1430
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,599
you stop the audio and

1431
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:56,960
start the audio

1432
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,920
ah i uh i hadn't considered that at all

1433
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,079
i just

1434
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,119
assumed somebody said it last time in

1435
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:02,480
last meetings

1436
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,319
somebody was saying that you should you

1437
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,799
shouldn't be using you know

1438
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,720
uh the built-in mute buttons in your

1439
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:10,400
microphones

1440
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,839
even if you like even if you're a chair

1441
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,119
you might want to be able to you know

1442
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:15,599
talk all the time

1443
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,359
so you should you should be just muting

1444
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,240
it in local microphone you should

1445
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:21,598
keep it running and or or stop the audio

1446
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:25,279
of anyone that's

1447
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:28,160
you know yeah very wrong for the dog

1448
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,960
yeah i i think i i don't i don't recall

1449
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:33,839
that but i think

1450
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,839
um that's probably harder to travel

1451
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,839
uh

1452
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:55,200
yeah i was just wondering um i i mean

1453
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,520
i've gotta

1454
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:03,839
go now i've only i only had till the top

1455
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:08,799
of the hour but

1456
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,799
now you've lost your audio pete

1457
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:19,279
now yeah testing okay so

1458
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,720
it um i've gotta leave because it is the

1459
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,119
top of the hour but

1460
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,118
i was wondering if there is gonna be

1461
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:26,079
another opportunity or a continuing

1462
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,400
opportunity

1463
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,480
to log into a room as chair to play

1464
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,400
around with stuff

1465
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,680
yeah definitely during meeting we will

1466
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,960
have 30 minutes

1467
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:40,319
from our chairs compared together

1468
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:45,839
uh test test together together

1469
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:45,839
and uh

1470
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,359
you are expected

1471
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,520
so yeah those would be bookable spots

1472
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:07,359
during meeting

1473
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:11,200
only during the meeting week itself not

1474
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:13,759
not beforehand yeah yeah i think i think

1475
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,520
that's the current plan currently if you

1476
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,520
have a request and we can

1477
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,240
make it happen just shoot an email and

1478
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,920
we'll see how making that happen

1479
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,879
by the way was i the only one hearing

1480
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,920
echo during that conversation

1481
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,400
i was hearing an awful lot of echo but

1482
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,160
now i know

1483
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,160
it was i couldn't understand that nobody

1484
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,920
else was that going but greg was echoing

1485
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,078
every time he talked

1486
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,319
yep i have full responsibility i have no

1487
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,000
headset so i'm sorry

1488
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,079
i'll do better next week actually beat

1489
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,480
causing that one

1490
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,240
because when he moved him himself then

1491
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,119
we lost the echo

1492
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:51,520
yeah ah and pete is now not sending

1493
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,119
audio so sorry pete good to see you

1494
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,599
uh let me know if we uh need to set

1495
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:57,920
something up in advance

1496
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,920
and my other question is so i've noticed

1497
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,119
that occasionally the screen will sort

1498
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,680
of

1499
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,440
like flash or some i don't know how to

1500
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,520
describe it exactly am i the only one

1501
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,880
seeing that

1502
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:14,000
i do not see it okay

1503
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,680
i mean keeps working so it's

1504
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,720
gonna be a little annoying but okay well

1505
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,520
this is a very good i feel

1506
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:23,118
it's a nice improvement over last time
