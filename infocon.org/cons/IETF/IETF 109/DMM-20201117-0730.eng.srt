okay now thanks pablo for that and now

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,159
a few things i think

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:40,320
our last idf meeting was itf

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,960
106. honor 7 was cancelled 108 we did

58
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,400
not schedule it so

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,039
between 106 and now i think a few

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,719
updates

61
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,600
the key things is we i think uh

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,840
the distributed mobility anchoring draft

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
is published as

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,919
rfc818 contracts to the authors

65
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
i think it was in the queue for a long

66
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,960
time but uh it

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
had to go through several revisions and

68
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,400
even re-write

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,159
so but thanks for all the efforts

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,320
all the authors and also

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,759
you know premium v6 extensions for dmm

72
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,599
is also published as rfc rfc8885

73
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,840
thanks again to the office i think uh

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,240
so that's that's the key update and now

75
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
on the working group the documents i

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
think uh

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,400
we have the user plane protocol uh and

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
architecture analysis document

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,000
that's uh it's coming out you know

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,880
pretty good

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
uh that's in a great shape in general i

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,320
think uh

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
last time i believe the authors were not

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,400
ready for the last call or

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
at least you know i thought but now we

86
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
should

87
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,440
probably in the next you know now it

88
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,840
should be able to move forward

89
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,199
the other document is segment routing

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,880
srv6 the mobile user claim

91
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,639
this one there was a dependency on the

92
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,159
spring document i think now those

93
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
dependencies are clear

94
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,360
getting cleared and i think now we

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,199
should be

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,280
able to take this forward i think uh

97
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
there are two other documents related to

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,679
fpc

99
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,680
i think this one

100
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
there hasn't been much progress uh

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,919
charlie

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
and lyle two of the key authors are

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,440
not active and charlie retired so we are

104
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,440
having a few issues on this one we did

105
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,919
talk to our area director eric on this

106
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,759
right we promised to see show some

107
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
activity on this but uh that did not

108
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,120
happen

109
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,960
so for now you know we are not making

110
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
any decision on this yet but

111
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
uh we want some more time to reach out

112
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
to charlie and laurel and uh

113
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
finally make a decision but but it's so

114
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,319
sad the document is almost done it's

115
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,440
just that

116
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,000
that one last push i think that's

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,639
one in fact all we need is just a you

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
know

119
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,919
publishing the document a new revision

120
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
and

121
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,599
somebody willing to you know address any

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,719
comments ideas

123
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,280
through the iesc process uh but

124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,560
i think uh tremendous amount of efforts

125
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,039
went into this

126
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,639
this document i think that's uh it will

127
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
be unfortunate if you leave it out here

128
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,240
but uh

129
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,240
but let's see what comes up now

130
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
this is where we are with respect to the

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,120
working group documents

132
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,199
right i think now today's

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,240
topics i think you know there are you

134
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
know

135
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,560
updates on the the two working documents

136
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,120
and

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
two other new topics and

138
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,599
also there is a

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,400
rechartering discussion we would like to

140
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
you know uh

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,520
discuss that at the end of the

142
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,720
presentations like to see like you know

143
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,639
i think

144
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
overall this working group is chartered

145
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,800
to do two things right

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,039
overall what are the topics that we

147
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
actually do for the distributed mobility

148
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,560
management that

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,520
we are somewhat you know getting closer

150
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,440
to completion

151
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
right the srv6 work is a major thing

152
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,960
that's left out

153
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,000
but at least the other documents were

154
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,719
done

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
and we also are chartered to support any

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
mobile ipv6 pm v6

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
v6 extensions as an ongoing process that

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,080
was the

159
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
agreement when we form the working group

160
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,400
so so

161
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,240
that is there but uh overall for the

162
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,838
near topics we'd like to have

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,320
you know see some interest i think you

164
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,839
know more last i think a

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
few months we have been you know the

166
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,000
terribly really bad actually with

167
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,680
respect

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,200
to working group activity i think it's

169
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,959
more than the

170
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
the participants even the chairs we were

171
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,560
not active i think uh it's inside a

172
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,880
perfect example as how

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,319
not to run a iet working group but i

174
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
think hopefully

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
you know i think if you bring some focus

176
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
back and like with some new topics and

177
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
if there's proper interest we want to

178
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,200
take it forward

179
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,319
at least that's the that's the goal and

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
uh

181
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,200
with that i think um today's topics

182
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240
first topics is uh the transport network

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,760
availability

184
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,560
for 5g uh uma

185
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,800
is going to present this uma are you

186
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
there

187
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:27,120
okay i'm here so okay

188
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,518
let me you know share nothing once okay

189
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,399
i'm trying to see what's the best way to

190
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
show you i guess

191
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
um

192
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,239
you can see this i probably are still

193
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,359
seeing the

194
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,440
uh i think the 5g usb analysis forks

195
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
have a subscribe

196
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
okay you're able to see the sling that's

197
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
what you see

198
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,760
um i can see that today is pretty deep

199
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,800
but uh

200
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
i don't see that right

201
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
okay one once again just let me make

202
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,439
sure

203
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,439
okay i don't know just

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,199
okay let me stop

205
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:33,839
let me open the local copy and then

206
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:33,839
share once again

207
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,839
um you can now see

208
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,519
hello uh hi hi i couldn't see your

209
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:15,839
slides you want me to present myself

210
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,839
yeah go ahead actually

211
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:29,839
so let's do it

212
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,920
uh s3 i'm not sure how to you have to

213
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,839
give control to me or

214
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,839
how is it one second just

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,399
okay cool now i can see it you're

216
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,000
screaming did you see something i

217
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,360
couldn't hear

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,279
no no okay yeah yeah let's

219
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,279
all right okay please go ahead

220
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,639
uh again it's a blank screen it's a

221
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,639
black screen now

222
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
oh yeah yeah good good first idea okay

223
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,359
okay so uh i'm going to talk about hi

224
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
this is uma i'm going to talk about

225
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,279
transport network availability for 5g

226
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,040
and uh just give a recap so i'm going to

227
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
talking mostly about the updates that

228
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,959
have been done

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,000
uh last two months but to give a recap

230
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,199
for the people

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,200
who were not there earlier so uh release

232
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,240
15 23 5 0 1 5 0

233
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,760
specified 5g architecture and various

234
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,160
mobility procedures for ue which covers

235
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
uh

236
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,839
4g 4g case ssc mode 1 and move to mode 3

237
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,240
which are specific to 5g right so uh

238
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,360
make before creating ssd3

239
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,360
but the problems are so these uh uh

240
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,360
there is no transport network awareness

241
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,399
in the scenarios right so

242
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,000
uh if they care about ran uh their radio

243
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,760
access network and the core network

244
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
but the transport network is not

245
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
factored uh so

246
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,800
why this has to be factored because some

247
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,880
of the use cases where here we are at 5g

248
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
regular uh network cases uh the

249
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
transport network

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
and sla guarantees transport network

251
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
need to be factored

252
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,639
both on f1 new and npn interfaces uh

253
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
so it is difficult to the current

254
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,440
approach it's difficult to provide sl

255
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,399
guarantees end to end

256
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
um so this is uh this is this framework

257
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,160
addresses that aspect

258
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,199
and the second thing is there's an under

259
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,399
specified

260
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,719
mapping function from three pdu sessions

261
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
or to the uh network underlying paths uh

262
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,639
it could be

263
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,560
any underlay it's not specific to a

264
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,560
particular underlay like rsvp

265
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,880
sr or any versions of sr but there is no

266
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
underlying mapping function so this has

267
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,399
to be defined because

268
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,160
when the mobility happens from uv uh it

269
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,680
has to be uniformly configured across

270
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
network

271
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,040
so this aspect also has been addressed

272
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,040
in this draft

273
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,199
on x right please

274
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,040
yeah okay so

275
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,399
so this draft was first presented in

276
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,079
july 2018 ietf 102 in montreal

277
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
uh this mobility function aware

278
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,319
underlying transport has been defined

279
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
here

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
and mapping to various underlying

281
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,279
transfer technologies

282
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
initially like you know we laid out a

283
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,079
lot of stuff also we talked about lisp

284
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,639
and other

285
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,239
uh uh technologies at the time 2018

286
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
we're talking about uh

287
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,000
uh ila based mobility and other

288
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,480
scenarios but we

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,399
eventually in our number 2001 we just

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,880
focused on the

291
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
specific two aspects that is how uh how

292
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,760
the framework can be defined how the

293
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,760
underlying transport mapping can be

294
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,319
defined so these two aspects we boiled

295
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,839
on

296
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,440
uh in november 2018 um both in and three

297
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
online interfaces we started

298
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,519
n9 is the new interface in 5g uh how the

299
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,680
cost is being carried in both these

300
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,440
interfaces has been defined

301
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,040
missing transport network related items

302
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
like slice selection and integrated

303
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
approach

304
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,719
there are two approaches as defined in a

305
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
backward compatible way in 4g

306
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
deployments which addresses the 4g

307
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
deployments and eventually

308
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,320
which can be migrated to 5g uh both

309
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
cases have been defined in section 2.2

310
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,959
and eventually section 3 some updates as

311
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
for

312
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
uh comments received from uh from the

313
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,320
list and offline

314
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,880
in uh 2009 ieta 105 we further

315
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
uh we got a lot of feedback time in one

316
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,759
of my time

317
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,800
so we have contributions from although

318
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,160
star we are working on the rant

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
landslide mostly

320
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,759
and nokia for future wireless and

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
interdisciplinary so they have a lot of

322
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,839
discussion a lot of contributions so

323
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,439
uh their content have been added and as

324
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
a co-authors have been all set as

325
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,959
co-authors

326
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,000
and uh that time or there were we

327
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,599
because we couldn't come up with a

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,360
unified approach so there were two

329
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,120
solutions

330
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,839
set for the time in zero four version

331
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,839
next slide please

332
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,160
us even eventually these two solutions

333
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,240
got harmonized in zero five

334
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,519
uh simplified solution approach and uh

335
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
we left with the one

336
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
outstanding issue how to carry the

337
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,638
transport network context identified in

338
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
the packet

339
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,720
so we don't want to specify anything srv

340
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,320
specific because

341
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
uh the network some parts of the network

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,680
cannot do we may not use

343
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,279
sr at all or some layer 2 network so we

344
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,560
we have a lot of ideas from the working

345
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,079
group that time so finally eventually um

346
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,719
settled up with one option which is

347
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,800
neutral to the trafficking moving in the

348
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,160
transport

349
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,599
so uh we also added uh further

350
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
refinements in zero six

351
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,000
by john and all the updates and some of

352
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,160
the comments received in the list

353
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
uh some of comments received on the

354
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,800
november 2000 singapore

355
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
meeting has been presented in the list

356
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,839
next

357
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,678
so a recent comment summary so now sorry

358
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,520
unfortunately we couldn't present last

359
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,760
uh two sessions because there's no dmm

360
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,160
session and also we're also not active

361
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,000
um

362
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,799
various other things that were happening

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,520
uh so unfortunately we couldn't uh uh

364
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,639
progress further but when we asked two

365
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,119
months back uh

366
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,400
chase asked to uh discuss in the working

367
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,639
group and uh we

368
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
mentioned it and a couple of folks

369
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,840
responded with a couple of comments

370
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,000
uh one is from one comment is from pablo

371
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,760
uh related to simplifying section three

372
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,679
uh section three and appendix

373
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
uh which is the new mobility scenarios

374
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:46,480
with the tv mechanism ppr

375
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,400
uh second comment is additional ranges

376
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,840
texan this demand scenario for

377
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,480
enterprise 5g use cases

378
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,399
they're working on so they wanted to um

379
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
extend this to end-to-end scenario where

380
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,679
your session generation is not happening

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
on the edge rather than

382
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,360
on the cloud right so in this case n2

383
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
under service they want sdm sd1

384
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,678
extensions you want security

385
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,360
um to be added to the range of some of

386
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,280
the ranges defined in the draft

387
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,799
uh finally some a couple of comments

388
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,559
created inconsistent descriptions and

389
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
list items have been also asked by

390
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,120
kaushik and

391
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,120
these are the summary of the comments

392
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,760
okay so uh uh what we changed to zero

393
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,160
eight so

394
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
uh the last region uh so the main

395
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
section is

396
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,639
from pablo to take care of the public's

397
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,280
comments uh we uh

398
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
we just simplified the section three and

399
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,840
uh just to show the applicability of the

400
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
framework

401
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,439
on different underlays uh this is not

402
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,000
meant to be exhaustive on the list like

403
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
you know

404
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
we discussed couple of underlays how

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,360
this can be done

406
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,280
so this similarly uh any new underlying

407
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,360
transport mechanism can be used

408
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,559
with this framework in a mobility domain

409
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,399
similarly appendix

410
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,600
which is related to ssc modes various

411
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,600
mobility scenarios

412
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
uh have been described and you know that

413
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,280
that pablo asked to remove that into a

414
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,639
surprise section because that is mostly

415
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,799
focused on ppr

416
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,679
how that can be done so this all been

417
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,879
moved to a different

418
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,600
raft ppr and that is appropriately

419
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
referenced in

420
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,120
various parts of this draft

421
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,559
unfortunately both the drafts are

422
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,479
uploaded on the same day

423
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,399
i could not add the reference into this

424
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
draft so

425
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
so unfortunately i couldn't do that so

426
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,480
that's one thing that's the last thing

427
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,480
that's spinning on this

428
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,919
uh yes and other ranges says kaushik

429
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,320
asked we are

430
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
we added the text to uh define the

431
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,000
additional ranges for the security

432
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,679
uh with slicing like you know some

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,559
slices they want security as a key

434
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
parameter

435
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,320
so uh this is in addition to uh what

436
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,719
happens

437
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,120
from the g note b emits the packet with

438
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,440
ipsec in cases of it cannot be done

439
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,479
uh this can be done in the pin in front

440
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,840
of it

441
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
uh and the comments are also this next

442
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,160
i think uh we were ready from other

443
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
point of view undercover the common side

444
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,799
from zero section

445
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
zero six version itself but uh

446
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,039
unfortunately you can follow up

447
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,799
as i specified earlier so uh current

448
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,799
version is explained at us for the

449
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,120
comments received uh last month and uh

450
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,520
and that been all addressed so we feel

451
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
uh from other side we wanted to

452
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
ask for working reproduction and i want

453
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,840
to continue further continuous work

454
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,719
based on the amount of uh efforts this

455
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,360
has been already

456
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,360
done on this

457
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,840
okay thanks ma

458
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
so any questions comments

459
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,200
hi pablo right yeah

460
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,480
do you have it you're telling me to

461
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,320
yourself okay let me unmute yeah

462
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,600
okay yeah please go ahead okay so

463
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,158
um first many thanks to the authors

464
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,080
uh for all the work on this document and

465
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,440
improving significantly the document

466
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,960
is the last reason and i do have

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,679
two comments um so the first comment

468
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
is written on the scalability in section

469
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,080
2-3

470
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,158
and basically you say that an mpnc

471
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,840
represents a slice with a given qs

472
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,520
configuration and a transport path in

473
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,280
between two particular

474
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,559
predictive etfs um and so basically what

475
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,600
you say is that the

476
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,000
in section two you say that the mtnc

477
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,799
idea

478
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,679
space is actually scaling a score to the

479
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,360
number of sites

480
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,640
um identifiers so with 50 minutes is

481
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,760
enough

482
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,039
um now the question that i have for you

483
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,440
is that

484
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,400
if i do the math if you have three

485
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
traffic classes

486
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,840
and 200 gps for example you have already

487
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,439
burned

488
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,559
all of these 16-bit ideas

489
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
and the question that they have for you

490
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,480
is have you considered decoupling the

491
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,360
slice id from the heart id because to me

492
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
it seems like

493
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,080
you could really only i mean one way

494
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,840
that you can improve scalability is just

495
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,158
by encoding the

496
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,000
an identifier for the slides instead of

497
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,000
an identifier for this license

498
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,280
uh pablo i think you're breaking up but

499
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,400
what i'm understanding i just want to

500
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
let me repeat that what i'm

501
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,520
understanding so

502
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,439
so you're saying that identify space is

503
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,799
not enough with empty and say id defined

504
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,960
here

505
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,480
with number of ups that's what you're

506
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,280
saying

507
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,679
so i'm saying that yes i think it is not

508
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
enough

509
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,840
and my question is why don't you

510
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,600
decouple the slice from the path

511
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,240
id oh no no okay

512
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,760
so path id you don't have to uh so see

513
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,720
you you don't have to

514
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,120
it's not coupled at all right so so what

515
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,200
is

516
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,799
done is uh when the packet is emptied

517
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,039
from gmp or upf

518
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,879
uh the source ports are representative

519
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,840
of this la the information ssd

520
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
information

521
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,320
so that information you can use it uh in

522
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,039
the pe to

523
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,918
configure policy if you are using sr

524
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,200
srv6 or sr mpls whatever the technology

525
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
you use underlying

526
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,240
use a configuration policy in the

527
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
ingress node

528
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:22,240
and use those codes to map it so there's

529
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:24,479
not directly with path id no

530
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,520
so if you have a path id it will you can

531
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,000
manage it better

532
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,799
but it's not required you can manage it

533
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
better

534
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,440
uh from management plan you can manage

535
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,080
it better but it's not essential

536
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,120
okay so then just to confirm the mtnc

537
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,760
idea space is

538
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,399
independent from the number of upfs you

539
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
have then

540
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,159
right right that's correct but there was

541
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,200
in section i forgot the section there

542
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,840
was a calculation

543
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,559
john has done uh the typical scenario

544
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,879
how many

545
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,600
are required and you know how this is

546
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,840
justified

547
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,120
there was a text based on that and you

548
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,559
can see that if it is

549
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,399
if you have any questions i'm happy to

550
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
answer there but that has discussion has

551
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,279
been done in one of the versions

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,480
and we added specifically text for that

553
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:11,279
okay thank you yeah okay

554
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,279
oh i know is next oh no yeah

555
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:20,000
can you hear me yes yes right

556
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:23,120
just just checking this that

557
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
observation that in in this work group

558
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,879
they're working on

559
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
network slices and and they have also

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,640
the framework

561
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,360
this looks fitting into that but i think

562
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,000
later on

563
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
when you develop further this it it

564
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
would be good to

565
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,640
have in in line what what this working

566
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
group is doing otherwise we are just

567
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,120
acting

568
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,600
more confusing here okay so i can i can

569
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,360
take this

570
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,360
somebody uh commented on this and the

571
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,678
working room calls in the mailing list

572
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,678
so yes so this work has been started

573
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,159
with you for almost one half year before

574
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,760
this workbook is done i started i think

575
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,600
this working group i am following this

576
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,000
closely what this working group is

577
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,399
doing uh both the framework document the

578
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,799
definition document

579
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,840
they are not specifically targeting of

580
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,720
course the 3gpp use case is there but

581
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,000
it is a more generic framework idf slice

582
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,279
what is idea of slice

583
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,679
and what is uh required but we are

584
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,120
talking about two two two points that's

585
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
being addressed in this draft is

586
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,760
a little bit orthogonal but uh but only

587
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,640
thing common is eventually once the

588
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,720
young models are defined there uh if

589
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
if working group accepts this draft we

590
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
can

591
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,799
extend that whatever the framework they

592
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
come up with we can extend

593
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,240
whatever the mapping scenarios we

594
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,080
creating here we can add it there we are

595
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,120
not conflicting with what we are

596
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,120
generically proposing if you have any

597
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,199
particular comment if you think you are

598
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,639
conflicting anything you can we i i'll

599
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,559
definitely take your comment seriously

600
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,000
and take off

601
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,840
okay but i see you thank you

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,880
okay all right so yeah i think uh

603
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,320
thanks uh uh thanks for the sir so

604
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,320
uma did you present this in other

605
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,918
working groups like transport or other

606
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,520
any other

607
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:15,039
groups now way back we presented

608
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,320
i'm not remembering uh no we only

609
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,960
presented in dmm

610
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,678
we thought of presenting no i think this

611
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,000
working group

612
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,760
john has presented i believe oh no no

613
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,360
wait a minute yeah john has presented in

614
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,760
peace working up in a different format

615
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,520
oh yeah now i remember so john has one

616
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,600
contribution in last year

617
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,080
so he was presenting in peace but rather

618
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,399
than it's mostly 3gpp specific

619
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,000
uh so we he merged that portion that

620
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
part of the draft into this draft

621
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,600
so yes it's kind of kind of presented in

622
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,480
waste by john

623
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,080
yeah all right okay i think uh yeah

624
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,080
where we'll get the work done

625
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
probably that's you know a separate

626
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,600
discussion but in general i just

627
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,039
you know i think it's good to get some

628
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,240
feedback from other groups as well

629
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,158
right so i think so you are suggesting

630
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
authors are suggesting we you know issue

631
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,080
an adoption call is that what the

632
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,840
you know ask is yes that's that's what

633
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,520
we're asking based on the

634
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,678
effort that has been undergone and you

635
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,960
know the consensus we have on this

636
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,559
document so i think this is

637
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,080
not a good starting point for further

638
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,440
progressing the work i feel

639
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,199
we feel okay so maybe let's do a quick

640
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,559
poll on like how many people have read

641
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,840
the draft uh

642
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,960
sort of the sound can you issue a

643
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,959
polaroid thing please

644
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,799
show up hands too

645
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,240
okay john is saying he presented only in

646
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
dmm okay

647
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,639
okay so eight numbers

648
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,918
okay

649
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
all right people i have

650
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,440
all rendered okay so

651
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,879
we will discuss with eric and uh in the

652
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,279
mailer

653
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,279
adoption

654
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,840
okay thanks sri thanks

655
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
okay

656
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,840
okay so do you see my

657
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
screen now

658
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,000
um

659
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000

all right let me let me try this during

663
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,039
the preparation i

664
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:50,080
think we can have a voice from yeah

665
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:55,840
in the queue oh yeah

666
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,840
oh okay

667
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,678
hello can you hear me yes

668
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,679
okay

669
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
so um

670
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
okay

671
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,880
so who is presenting

672
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,159
mia i see yeah

673
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,200
uh yes so still i cannot share my screen

674
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,200
okay

675
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,440
let me see if i can do that that's fine

676
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,440
let's

677
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
just

678
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:19,840
it's not good to share so

679
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:19,840
can you try this

680
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,840
this is

681
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,840
what is the context

682
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:29,840
okay then i will i will share

683
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,840
how about now

684
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:57,840
do you see the screen

685
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
um

686
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:24,880
no it says permission error

687
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,879
are you

688
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:39,840
restriction ah perhaps

689
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,919
i would use

690
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,840
let me try

691
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,839
what you should

692
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:39,440
but nothing

693
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,440
i checked the privacy but there's no

694
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,679
okay yes wow thank you

695
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,399
thank you thank you sorry for taking

696
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,879
time

697
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,719
thank you very much so um thank you for

698
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,159
your time this draft discusses

699
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,520
the architectural implication um

700
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,720
to supplement the srv6 mobile user

701
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,440
playing draft

702
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:09,439
which is um dmm working group document

703
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:13,200
so agenda is

704
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,040
so we revisited the objective

705
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,319
of the draft and then architectural

706
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,400
discussion and then

707
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,200
we are discussing about the

708
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,520
exemplification

709
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,118
of network sizing edge computing and

710
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,839
urlc

711
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:31,839
so next slide please

712
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,440
so we have revisited the objective

713
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,960
of this draft and basically this

714
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
document discusses

715
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
a solution approach and its

716
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,000
architectural benefits

717
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,880
of common data playing across domains

718
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,520
which includes ue ip transport data

719
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,640
center

720
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,599
applications and across

721
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,598
overlay underlay

722
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
so this approach maybe in a sense

723
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,040
contrary to

724
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,720
proposals that the underlying

725
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,759
transport can be anything but it is an

726
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,799
approach to make the network as flat as

727
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,520
possible and make making it more

728
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,480
suitable for the distributed mobile

729
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,480
deployment model

730
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:30,800
next page please

731
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,000
so the diagram shows a typical

732
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
example of the mobile network so gtp

733
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,960
session

734
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:42,560
from ue to mobile anchor upf

735
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,119
in this diagram and mpls or segment

736
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,480
routing

737
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,680
is used in the transport network and

738
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,280
vxlan or geneve or whatever

739
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,640
for segmentation in data center

740
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:01,040
and the vlog id is used as a

741
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,078
correlating id and that firewall

742
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,279
is used for

743
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,400
for the address conversion and

744
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,440
perimeter security

745
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,440
next slides please

746
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,799
and this architecture has some

747
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,000
limitations

748
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,760
so this um tunnel based architecture

749
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,359
is not optimized for edge or distributed

750
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,480
computing

751
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,799
and gtp session termination uh could be

752
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,240
a

753
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,880
scaling bottleneck and it's also not

754
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,359
optimized for any to any communication

755
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,440
and

756
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:51,680
the security model is perimeter security

757
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:56,000
um next right please

758
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:59,359
for future distributed uh mobile network

759
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,839
uh where access is heterogeneous

760
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,680
and data is spread

761
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,880
ubiquitously by multi-cloud

762
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,919
or distributed edge cloud the

763
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,200
architecture

764
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,200
need to change

765
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,839
oops we use

766
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,839
this

767
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,839
right

768
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,839
sister sort of take a moment

769
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
okay

770
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,520
yes sorry for the trouble

771
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,880
thank you so for the future distributed

772
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,839
mobile network

773
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,480
um access should be more heterogeneous

774
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,359
next

775
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,079
next slide yeah so actually should be

776
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,040
heterogeneous

777
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,359
and data should be spread ubiquitously

778
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,800
by

779
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,799
multi-cloud or distributed edge cloud

780
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,720
so we are aiming more simple

781
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,200
on flat architecture by communalize data

782
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,319
plane

783
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,319
across domain and ovary underlay

784
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,919
next next page please

785
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,079
so as some example for

786
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,759
applicability of 5g mobile network

787
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,880
um so the one is network slicing

788
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,920
so basically flat network can

789
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,880
eliminate pec hierarchy

790
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,240
so the current issue that is that uh

791
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,680
certain extra id

792
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,359
like viral id is needed for segregating

793
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,279
traffic and mapping

794
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,880
it onto this designated slice

795
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,359
and the pe and pec connect connection

796
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,920
is a single quantum failure so some form

797
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,078
of the redundancy is required

798
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,079
but

799
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,480
if upf or mobile anchor can

800
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,839
belong to ip network it can directly

801
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,960
interact with networks license and or

802
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,920
make applications

803
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,280
on multi access its computing

804
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,160
applications

805
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,040
uh by the way it does not mean we must

806
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,399
eliminate

807
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:46,160
pce hierarchy we can still have

808
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,599
domain boundary or a pc hierarchy

809
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,040
depending on the network design

810
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,160
but to flatten the network

811
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:03,839
could have some advantages next

812
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,839
things please

813
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,400
and for edge computing edge

814
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,400
or distributed computing needs some

815
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,520
application framework

816
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,200
and data plane will be simple

817
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,960
and should be easily

818
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,279
implemented in compute stack

819
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,079
so that application can interact with

820
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,440
the

821
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,160
data brain using next

822
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,160
page please

823
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:44,960
and for you our llc

824
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,400
um 3gpp pr237

825
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,640
section 6.4 addresses the issue

826
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,680
on how to support redundant data

827
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,839
transmission

828
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,200
via single upf and signal

829
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:03,119
land node but but overlay

830
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,680
terminal cannot ensure the disjoint path

831
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,319
also the replication and merging point

832
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,919
would be

833
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,920
the single point of failure

834
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,960
in this context as well um srv6 is

835
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,119
simpler to support

836
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,079
height sla and you already received

837
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,359
furthermore um srv6 supports in-band

838
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,920
telemetry or

839
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,640
timestamping for latency monitoring and

840
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,079
control

841
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,920
so it could be a big advantage

842
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,800
in terms of monitoring and controlling

843
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,800
the latency

844
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,839
next slide please

845
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,160
um so this documentary discussed

846
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,680
our solution approach with system b6 and

847
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,078
it architectural benefits

848
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,879
of common data playing across domains

849
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,079
and across

850
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,640
across overlay underlay we

851
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,560
believe that this approach makes the

852
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,400
network as flat as possible

853
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,040
and enable distributed mobile deployment

854
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,640
which has advantage for major 5g

855
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,440
requirements

856
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,160
like network slicing edge computing and

857
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,960
url

858
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:25,598
erasing and

859
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,000
so this proposes the data frame will be

860
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,000
more

861
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,040
simple and flat and we'd like to ask

862
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,560
dmm working group to add this document

863
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,240
thank you very much thank you

864
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,599
thank you mia so i think

865
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,879
you know you don't have enough time to

866
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,839
have any questions on this but uh

867
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,839
yeah now discussions

868
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
okay

869
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,240
okay it's here

870
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
shhh

871
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,720
one

872
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,720
so dancing

873
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:47,839
i want to share

874
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,839
unfortunately

875
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:14,480
can i ask a quick question uh or no i

876
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,480
don't know

877
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,240
right so i think it's a good summary of

878
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,440
where services

879
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,319
can be used uh but i i think i didn't

880
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,079
understand the relation between the

881
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:33,359
overland under the case right so overlay

882
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,480
is the gtp

883
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,319
so is it referring to the asytarou's

884
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,200
draft where overlay can be removed

885
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,800
with srv6 or it's focusing on only on

886
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,560
the underlay part i think from the last

887
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,960
layer it shows that both are over and

888
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,960
underneath

889
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,759
what you you're saying about overlay or

890
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,000
regular

891
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,000
i i just want to be clear on that one

892
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,160
okay it could could be used for

893
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,240
controlling

894
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,720
the overlay as well

895
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,640
okay so that is the uh satoru's draft

896
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,560
right i think that's working with draft

897
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:25,839
where gtp can be replaced with srv6

898
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah can be okay okay okay thanks

899
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,000
be displaced to the gtp

900
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,520
one of the candidates to provide the

901
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,960
choice for the operator

902
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:53,839
to use whether the mobilizer plan is gtp

903
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,839
or services

904
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,640
okay breathe

905
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,160
can you hear me right yeah i can

906
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,040
so i i'm i am the presenter q just to be

907
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,680
able to

908
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,640
share my screen can you give me access

909
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,640
to share my screen

910
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,640
because i'm next right on agenda

911
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,559
yes yes okay good so i'm wondering if

912
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,760
the

913
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,640
statement of common data planet was

914
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,720
an application interaction uh with the

915
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,279
application interaction is the intent to

916
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,040
know that the

917
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,559
applications are part of the routing

918
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,400
fabric so that that are also

919
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:07,200
involved in distribution of segment

920
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,200
identifiers

921
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:18,880
um fortunately this could be um

922
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,880
your boy is a breakup you've got to chat

923
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:32,640
for the question how is

924
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,640
our applications interacting with

925
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,879
this common database are they part of

926
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,879
the routing

927
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,839
or not

928
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,680
i understand the question um the

929
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,720
how the application can interact

930
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:59,839
with the yes um

931
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:03,200
yes so the application needs some

932
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:05,839
um framework or programming

933
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,240
framework or programming platform and

934
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:10,240
such

935
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:13,598
platform need to support the data frame

936
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:17,200
and if the data plane is

937
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:20,319
supported by the compute stack then it's

938
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:24,078
um it becomes easier

939
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:26,960
to to be the application platform

940
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,960
that's what i mean

941
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:58,880
carlos

942
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:02,000
yeah you can leave me here my screen

943
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,000
you can get him

944
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,839
can i can i have a spin myself

945
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,319
um

946
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,319
okay

947
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:37,839
okay

948
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,880
okay perfect so uh i'm carlos bernardos

949
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,279
from uccm and i'm gonna present this

950
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,400
draft for the first time in dmm

951
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,240
i tried to be brief because my my goal

952
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
is to basically

953
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,000
present some some ideas general ideas

954
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,480
and to see whether there is interest in

955
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,040
working in this kind of topics

956
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,680
so the main motivation for this is to

957
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,200
work in

958
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,160
control solutions for mobility

959
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,960
management in

960
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,960
in distributed sfcs well in sfcs in

961
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,720
service fashion chains

962
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:14,480
where in sfc you know that there is a

963
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:16,000
working group in atf working on

964
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,760
on different mechanisms for service

965
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,119
function chaining and

966
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,160
control mechanisms for

967
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,599
for sfc were not there in scope

968
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,960
in sfc so they've even defined control

969
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,599
mechanisms

970
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,000
yet but i believe that is an interesting

971
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,040
topic

972
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,760
and mechanisms that are required and in

973
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,400
particular

974
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,240
there are some points regarding mobility

975
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,920
of functions migration of functions

976
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:44,959
within an sfc

977
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,520
that i believe could leverage from from

978
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,319
using

979
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,040
or reusing or extending mobility

980
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,200
protocols

981
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,160
as the ones define and maintaining the

982
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,680
mm

983
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,839
so in the picture i have just one

984
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,919
example of architecture so

985
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,599
even though i'm gonna use terminology

986
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,640
about cellular controllers and central

987
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,559
controls is

988
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,000
just an example so the idea is that we

989
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:06,559
have an sfc

990
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,240
so a function a service function chain

991
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,520
we have different nodes here

992
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,200
ues and a g node b and we may have an

993
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,720
infrastructure connected to the dnob in

994
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,960
the network

995
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,959
we have functions running on ues and

996
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,920
gnode bs for example we have function 1

997
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,280
running at node

998
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,160
a function 2 running at node b

999
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,839
and function 3 running in the g node b

1000
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,200
in node

1001
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:33,680
uh with current architectures we have a

1002
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,399
central controller slash orchestrator

1003
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,319
call it

1004
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,079
whatever you want that is basically

1005
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,880
managing responsible of

1006
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,280
the control the lifecycle management and

1007
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,960
under control of the sfc

1008
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,640
and the motivation for this work was uh

1009
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,240
some solutions that we are exploring in

1010
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,359
which in addition to this central

1011
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,439
controller

1012
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,960
we may have what we call silver

1013
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,839
controllers but basically

1014
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,440
is other entities that are capable of

1015
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:02,319
also controlling the

1016
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,760
the sfc and one of the things that these

1017
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:07,279
controllers may do

1018
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,240
is detect the need of moving a function

1019
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,319
to another

1020
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,279
node for example in this scenario if

1021
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:15,200
node a b

1022
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:18,559
and c are moving away from node d

1023
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:22,000
function 3 that is used by this sfc

1024
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,839
may may not be in reachable anymore

1025
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,160
and we need to migrate that function

1026
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,520
three to another node for example node c

1027
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,960
in the in the uec so this is the

1028
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,599
motivation for

1029
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,640
having a mechanism that allows two move

1030
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,760
functions migrate functions in sfc

1031
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,799
and our approach or our proposal is to

1032
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,480
extend

1033
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:47,599
mobile ipv6 mechanisms with new

1034
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,520
uh messages for this specific purpose

1035
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,599
that is moving a function

1036
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,720
which is something similar to moving a

1037
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,559
host but

1038
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,720
not the same thing because here

1039
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,079
we have that the node that is triggering

1040
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,680
the movement is not

1041
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,160
may not be the move the node that is

1042
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,799
moving itself and we don't have like

1043
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:08,960
central

1044
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,880
entities like a home agent or an lma so

1045
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,160
basically the scenario is different and

1046
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,799
i'm going to go into the details because

1047
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
again my

1048
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,960
my idea for this presentation is to see

1049
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,680
whether you think that this may be

1050
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,520
of interest of dmm i i want to present

1051
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,720
this kind of work also in ssc but it's a

1052
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,599
cd we meet

1053
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,799
for the last uh couple of uh itf

1054
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,480
meetings

1055
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:33,839
but the idea is that that we we extend

1056
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,079
the mobility pv6 to support this kind of

1057
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:39,119
mechanisms in the draft

1058
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,799
we define different mobility headers so

1059
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,400
one is service path update

1060
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,079
and the acknowledgement so basically

1061
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,359
this is like kind of a binding update

1062
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,240
thing

1063
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,839
for moving a function within sfc and we

1064
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,839
also need some mobility new mobility

1065
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,520
options to identify the network service

1066
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,839
and to identify

1067
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,000
the the functions that we are moving so

1068
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,119
again i will not go into the details

1069
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,839
so my my request here is

1070
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,880
basically to ask people for feedback on

1071
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,920
the mailing list

1072
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,559
and regarding if you think that this

1073
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,280
problem is

1074
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,640
of interest and this is part of an

1075
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,799
overall solution because for

1076
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,000
doing this kind of distributed sfc

1077
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,920
control we need other other

1078
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,280
things and there are a set of companion

1079
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,280
drafts that

1080
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,760
are listed there for for interested

1081
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,559
people to to check

1082
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,079
that's it i would like just to to call

1083
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,240
for feedback whenever you have

1084
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,000
time if you think that this is maybe of

1085
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,118
interest for you guys

1086
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,559
thanks uh thanks so

1087
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:41,920
much uh i look up any

1088
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,799
questions but one comment is

1089
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,799
typically element

1090
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,400
yeah because i mean there is no control

1091
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,799
mechanism no protocol for control

1092
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:03,440
defining yet so my my proportion is that

1093
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:04,799
if they go into this if they go into

1094
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,880
standardizing

1095
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:08,319
protocol extension for sfc control that

1096
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:11,680
is not specified by

1097
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:14,079
by ssc i believe that for mobility

1098
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,640
for for life cycle management operation

1099
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:20,240
related to mobility of functions

1100
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,640
i think that we could reuse uh mobile ap

1101
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,319
as a control protocol for that that's

1102
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,640
the proposal so they they need to do

1103
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,520
this if they wanna standardize this kind

1104
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,240
of

1105
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,880
sfc control that is uh they haven't done

1106
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,000
yet

1107
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,359
that sure well thanks

1108
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,760
i think a little less i think recently

1109
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,480
you know

1110
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
we are running on

1111
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:00,000
sorry about that all right uh

1112
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:09,839
that's the uh service anything

1113
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:09,839
or eric last one

1114
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,240
yeah sorry nothing from me lots more

1115
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,400
reading to do

1116
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,879
okay uh thanks everybody

1117
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,559
this is the end of that thank you thanks

1118
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:37,839
everybody

1119
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:37,839
i think yeah uh yeah i will follow up

1120
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:51,839
okay thank you

1121
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,359
you
