6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,198
time here as an introduction

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,720
but um whether you're a contributor or a

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,800
participant um

it next slide please bruno

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,200
uh so we have a very short uh or a very

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
small agenda i should say

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
not not short but um uh we're going to

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
have an update

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,839
and the future plans of the design team

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
uh followed by

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,559
um a discussion of the draft that

19
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
they've

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
they've just released i think i believe

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,279
it's version two now

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,718
um and then we'll open up the the floor

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
for discussion

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
which i hope is going to be most of this

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
session next slide

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,600
please bruno um so just for every to

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,360
level set everybody we

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
the the chairs of the uh the spring

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
working group we uh

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
created a design team um on the seventh

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,320
of july

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,360
um specifically to go and look at the

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,479
um subject of

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,520
uh compression or srv6 uh

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,799
over not not srv6 sr over

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,000
ipv6 and compression and we

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,439
tasked the design team with uh

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,720
two rather broad topics the first was to

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,079
come up with

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,400
the requirements for solutions uh for

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,158
compressing segment routing information

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,360
for use over ipv6 and the second was to

43
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,000
do a comparison

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,079
of the proposed approaches that we've

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,680
already got in terms of

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,520
individual contributions into the

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,159
working group

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
and present that information as input to

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,119
the working group

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,479
to be able to make some decisions on how

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
we move forward with this work

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
next slide please bruno

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
uh we specifically asked the design team

54
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,640
to work

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,400
independently of the spring chairs and

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,200
of the spring working group and we did

57
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,520
that um

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
deliberately because we wanted to make

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
sure that they had the autonomy to go

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,000
away and look at this

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,599
subject with with a fresh mind and to

62
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,959
come back and give us input into the

63
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,359
working group

64
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,560
so they self-organized within their own

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,480
charter and

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,319
the uh the results of which um

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,518
was the draft that you see on the screen

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,760
although i believe it's version two now

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
um we we obviously want to thank the

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,518
design team for the hard work

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,160
we know that they've been meeting more

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,879
than once a week for the past few

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
months a lot of work has gone into this

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,599
and

75
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,440
we're very thankful for for taking up

76
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,640
that work

77

channel mobile

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,399
uh i'm glad to report the status

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,000
of the design team to working group

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,879
on behavior of the team members

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,879
so next page

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,399
uh here is some overview of the design

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,680
team

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,200
uh i think the team was

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,720
set up at uh this july

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,679
uh now we have uh eight team members

99
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
uh chennai from huawei uh chung phong

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
from

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,879
uh

102
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,600
from nokia and i from

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
channel mobile

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:41,280
i think all the members worked very hard

105
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,520
in past four months and

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,119
we had the output of the initial version

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,280
of a compression requirement draft

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,360
about the mail list of the

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,799
design team now it's a private

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,080
but anyone can access the

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
archive it's a

112
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,880
public and about the document

113
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,039
for the internet draft we put them to

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,639
data tranq for some other documents

115
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:23,199
or meeting minutes we put them

116
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,360
to the github link this link is

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,720
open for anyone if you are interested in

118
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,840
you can access it for

119
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,800
some hour meeting minutes or

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,000
some other document about the meeting

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,039
i think typically we have a weekly

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
meeting in order to submit the

123
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,159
requirement draft

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,759
by atf 109

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,440
in last two months we run thais meetings

126
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,800
per week

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,160
i think team members offer greater

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,280
efforts on the document

129
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,720
zeus eiffel ensured that

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,239
we output the requirements draft

131
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:20,400
on time here i would like to thank

132
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:23,520
all the team members the next page

133
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,039
as uh just now uh

134
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,639
charles mentioned uh in fact

135
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,479
we have very clear uh

136
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:37,680
scope uh for the design team

137
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,599
uh the design team

138
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:46,960
is to produce some maybe rough concerns

139
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:50,240
output to the working group related to

140
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,440
two topics the first topic

141
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,199
is about the requirements for the

142
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,840
solution to comprise

143
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,199
comprise the segment writing list

144
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:09,119
segment routing information for use

145
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,319
over ipv6 and the second topic

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,599
is a comparison

147
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,280
or analysis of a proposed

148
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,560
approaches to comprising

149
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,599
segment routing information for use over

150
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,120
ipv6 next

151
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,240
page i think

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,000
uh working group chair also hope we can

153
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,120
answer following two questions uh one is

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,560
why there are several proposals already

155
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
standardized uh the other is whether is

156
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:48,240
their

157
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:51,599
value in picking one also

158
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,759
this may be included in the requirements

159
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,199
readout but i don't think

160
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,479
we have a done something

161
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:06,000
related to some questions

162
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,000
in the design team uh

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,360
of course uh chairs also agree that

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,800
if the design team

165
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,840
can't agree or doesn't think

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,240
it's helpful to report those

167
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,280
aspects that's also accepted

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,400
for the working group i think that is

169
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,639
good for design team next

170
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,639
page

171
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,479
so uh for the

172
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:45,440
time plan i think currently

173
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:48,800
uh design team uh have a two-stage

174
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,480
uh plan uh

175
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:57,439
the first stage is during

176
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,640
itf 108 to ietf 109

177
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,480
and we hope to uh out to put

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,399
a requirement draft i think you we

179
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,959
have achieved that

180
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,959
the second

181
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,120
phase during itf

182
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:23,279
109 to ietf

183
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:27,920
110 we will do some analysis

184
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:31,519
on several proposals and i will put

185
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
an analysis document

186
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
next page

187
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,000
so the progress of the design team

188
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,519
uh is so far so good

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,560
uh we kicked off since the end of

190
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,080
july and we have

191
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,640
had more than 20 meetings

192
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,640
till now

193
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,040
we will submit the

194
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,279
zero zero and zero one version of the

195
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,880
requirements

196
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,560
the link is shown

197
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,399
in the page you can review

198
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:19,040
the requirement draft

199
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:22,640
we call for comments on that

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,240
and i've seen quite a few comments

201
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:30,480
in the mail list uh i think we will

202
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,839
resolve the comments as soon as possible

203
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
next page

204
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,959
here is the overview of the requirement

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,479
draft

206
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,760
i i will escape this page

207
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
since we will present the requirement

208
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,560
document

209
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,920
detailed soon the next step

210
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,640
for the requirement draft we hope to

211
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
finish it

212
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:05,120
soon we hope to gather the

213
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:09,680
comments from working group in next

214
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:12,640
one or two week weeks and

215
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
resolve those

216
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,040
comments soon and we hope to generate a

217
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,959
new

218
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:25,199
version by end of this december

219
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,399
and uh next page

220
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,760
for the analysis draft phase

221
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
i think the design team will provide a

222
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,160
list of

223
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,519
proposals to analysis

224
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,519
uh to analyze

225
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,079
i think it may maybe in january

226
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,518
of 2021

227
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:54,959
and we hope to submit

228
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,959
analysis draft

229
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,240
maybe the initial draft

230
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,920
to working group before atf

231
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:09,279
uh wanton

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:14,800
that is the basic status

233
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:18,160
and our rough plan for the design team

234
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,030
thank you okay questions ron first

235
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,199
others please get on the queue

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,079
specifically to the outputs good points

244
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,440
these comments should be on this on this

245
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,000
part

246
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
please go ahead ron one thing i'd like

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
to add

248
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,560
to what wei chang said um i don't think

249
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
he meant to say this

250
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,319
but um the drafts that you're seeing

251
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,320
today

252
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,639
do not include all of the requirements

253
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,920
that are under considerate consideration

254
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
there are still a good many in the

255
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,240
parking lot that are yet to be worked on

256
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,239
would you agree with that wei chang

257
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,920
um yes i think i roughly

258
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,920
agree with you

259
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,120
okay andrew

260
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:22,319
[Music]

261
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,800
um hi i'm i'm going to try and keep this

262
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,519
brief

263
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,599
but firstly you started off in the

264
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,959
presentation and you said

265
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,920
that the design document was done

266
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,719
you then contradicted yourself and said

267
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
sometime

268
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,720
in december now i've gone through that

269
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
document

270
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,880
in quite some detail and

271
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,000
i'm concerned to say the least

272
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,040
that six months after we've started

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,519
this what i have in front of me

274
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
is a document that steps outside of the

275
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,360
charter

276
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,560
in a couple of areas i'm not going to go

277
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,639
my comments on the loop

278
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,719
about that and the rest of it does

279
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,839
nothing more than state the obvious

280
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
so my question to the chair is do you

281
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
really believe

282
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,120
that this design team is going to come

283
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,319
up with a proper

284
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,320
design document in a reasonable time

285
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
frame considering that you were already

286
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,880
over the time frame

287
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,959
which was promised to this working group

288
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,720
and do you believe that there will ever

289
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,199
be consensus

290
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,040
within that design team considering that

291
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,160
you have had a chair

292
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,279
already quit the design team and state

293
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,079
publicly that it is because the vendors

294
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,360
are ignoring the operator requirements

295
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,239
so what is the chair's opinion as to

296
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
where this is

297
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,360
really going to go

298
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,399
andrew uh be waiting before you respond

299
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,480
andrew i i have a couple of comments

300
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
the first comment is it's not been six

301
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,160
months it's been four months so let's

302
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,519
get that right

303
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
and the second thing is this is a

304
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
requirements document not a design

305
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,079
document

306
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,680
uh wei chain please go ahead

307
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:15,040
yeah so uh i i agree with

308
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,399
chair so uh i think design team

309
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,519
here is trying to give some

310
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,800
output uh and i think it

311
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,800
we hope to help a working group

312
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,160
to get a correct direction

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,359
for the technology and uh

314
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,360
as you just mentioned in fact i don't

315
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,600
know when we can

316
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,639
get agreement of in the working group

317
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,000
we make those plans just

318
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,519
to guide the design team

319
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,399
to work

320
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,639
higher efficiency because we have to set

321
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,680
some target

322
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:03,279
but all those drafts we

323
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,399
submitted to a working group

324
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,759
that is that's the individual draft

325
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,279
that means we still need

326
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:17,120
the uh strict

327
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,320
procedure i mean the review

328
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,440
and the comments and the

329
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,240
modification and to achieve rough

330
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,519
concerns

331
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,040
in working group so i think

332
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:34,320
we don't i'm not intended to

333
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,759
uh say we have guided agreement

334
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,680
or we have that conscience in our

335
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:46,160
uh design team then the working group

336
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,160
should accept this draft

337
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
we just uh it's

338
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
yet more than a week after comments were

339
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,800
sent to the list and a detailed analysis

340
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,839
of that document

341
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,880
i have seen zero response from

342
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,839
the team to to any of the comments

343
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,839
submitted

344
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,839
i would like in working group chair i

345
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:18,399
can answer the

346
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:21,839
give some comments

347
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,360
i would hope i i i can't tell

348
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,280
none of the chairs are going to tell the

349
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,198
design team how to deal with the

350
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,160
comments we hope you will be taking into

351
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
account

352
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,080
all the comments received on the list

353
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,160
and engaging with people on the list

354
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
and then going and continuing the design

355
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
team process as you said you expect to

356
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,199
finish

357
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
to do another revision and we hope that

358
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,320
will reflect

359
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,840
discussion so there's a better chance

360
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,570
that the working group will adopt the

361
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,039
result

362
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,320
[Music]

363
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,230
but we need to move on so

364
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,339
ahmed

365
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,339
[Music]

366
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,520
hello can you guys hear me oh yeah yes

367
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,600
yes we can

368
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,639
yeah okay um yeah it seems i mean in my

369
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,840
opinion

370
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,120
it seems like uh uh

371
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,799
the the best way to go for this is to

372
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,639
lay out the requirements

373
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,960
and have the working group decide

374
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,320
because as it was mentioned it seems has

375
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,520
been a long while

376
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,240
uh to and there is no consensus within

377
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
the design

378
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,559
team uh to to agree on what the

379
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,639
requirements are

380
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,000
the second point that i'm trying to make

381
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
is about

382
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,320
appendix a which is having

383
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,000
existing standards included

384
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
in my opinion that's very important

385
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,400
there have been many many years and many

386
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,840
many i'd say thousands if not hundreds

387
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,240
of thousands of hours

388
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,199
put to come up with these standards and

389
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
just

390
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
putting them aside i don't want to say

391
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,960
throwing them away

392
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,000
would not be a good idea i would think

393
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
that the

394
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,320
existing standards should be included as

395
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,120
part of the metrics

396
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,918
when we choose uh one of or more of the

397
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,840
designs

398
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:11,840
thank you very much

399
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
i apologize i sent my comments just

400
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,840
recently so

401
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,520
i'm looking forward for um

402
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,879
discussion but one

403
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,080
general question and concern that i have

404
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,280
so and that was highlighted both

405
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,639
in um chairs introduction and

406
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,840
and wei chang uh presentation

407
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,000
that the design team was chartered

408
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
to

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,960
set a requirements for

410
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,760
compressed sids

411
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,880
segment rounding identifiers in ipv6

412
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,080
network

413
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,760
and as i gather from the title

414
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,879
and abstract of the draft of their

415
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,080
document currently available

416
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,280
it's only settled on

417
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,480
a service 6 compressed

418
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,360
so it does appear that their charter

419
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,640
is broader than the scope of the

420
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,439
document

421
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,000
and will appreciate a comment from wei

422
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,320
chang

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,320
and if possible from the chairs

424
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
well i can comment from a chair's

425
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,120
perspective and uh

426
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:38,960
and bruno and joel uh please uh

427
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,199
pipe up as well if you have anything but

428
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,880
uh from our perspective greg

429
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,720
um we wanted to make sure that the

430
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
design team

431
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,159
had the autonomy to go away and make

432
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:53,280
their own decisions and we gave them

433
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,400
as you know a task to look at segment

434
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,158
routing

435
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,280
compression over ipv6 now if that design

436
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,320
team comes back

437
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,678
and they have a consensus that

438
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,799
the base of um the requirements that

439
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
they want to put out

440
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,840
is srv6 then they need to justify what

441
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,520
why that's the case on the other hand i

442
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,199
think

443
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,200
i saw in the document that there was

444
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,400
also discussion about

445
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,000
other um solutions and i think

446
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,840
um the design team can make some

447
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,520
comments on that because

448
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,639
at least from our perspective we hope

449
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,960
that they've looked at all

450
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,679
possible solutions to make those

451
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,679
requirements

452
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,679
well again i would appreciate

453
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,039
if the design team did follow the

454
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,039
charter

455
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:53,039
and yes i agree with you if they decide

456
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,200
that some aspects of the charter

457
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,080
must be outside the scope of the

458
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
document

459
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,320
there needs to be a very uh

460
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,080
technical discussion about it and uh

461
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,520
very strong arguments

462
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:12,080
because what i sense is that uh

463
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:15,760
their disconnect within the design

464
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,480
team uh might be related to this change

465
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,480
of the scope

466
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,360
okay thank you greg um i don't think

467
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
that more that the chairs can say at

468
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,280
this point

469
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
darren you're next yeah i think we

470
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,879
should uh i think we should let

471
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
we think continue with the presentation

472
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,159
for a lot of content to go through we

473
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,600
haven't we haven't seen that yet

474
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,360
um and if i can if i can

475
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,639
speak the greg's comment i think a lot

476
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,959
of which he said

477
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
uh is answered in that in that next

478
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,039
presentation or at least we'll give the

479
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,640
the rest of the audience the context it

480
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,799
needs in order to hear the answers to

481
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,799
that

482
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,479
there's also a few things that i dispute

483
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,480
from

484
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
the previous conversation but i'm sure

485
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,640
that they'll be repeated again

486
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,639
and and have the will have that chance

487
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,039
otherwise i think we should next

488
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,199
okay cool so uh regarding the uh

489
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
requirements i think

490
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,000
we are really uh hard working right

491
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,120
uh basically we have more than twice

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,039
meeting in some weeks right so if

493
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,158
someone is disappointed of

494
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,960
the progress i really like uh they

495
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,559
can make some contribution to the uh

496
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,400
design team if they want

497
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
but i'm not really sure that it will

498
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,240
help or not but

499
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
it doesn't matter and regarding the name

500
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
we did

501
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,559
make some discussions of the name of the

502
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,600
draft

503
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:01,440
so it is consensus of among the uh

504
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,678
design team and actually we can discuss

505
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,120
it

506
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,159
again if you want we can make it in the

507
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,158
mailing list yes

508
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,360
okay discuss at this point things have

509
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,720
been said enough discussion of the scope

510
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,080
of the document should probably come

511
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,080
after the next presentation

512
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,649
[Music]

513
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,039
since uh srv6 is has been defined in a

514
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,840
series of

515
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,400
rfc and working group documents and also

516
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,279
has been

517
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,919
deploying some operators for example

518
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,960
intelli telecom in several scenarios

519
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,400
so from standpoint of network migration

520
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,520
i think that a new uh future compressed

521
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,240
solution should be

522
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,200
as a basis based i think that this

523
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,440
should be

524
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:03,039
concerned as a basic requirement

525
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,070
that's all thank you okay

526
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,240
louie

527
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,840
[Music]

528
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,080
can you hear me yes all right

529
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,199
so i have three general comments uh my

530
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,399
first comments i want to thank the

531
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,159
design team we're

532
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,440
really grateful for you taking the time

533
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,120
and doing this

534
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,559
so anything you hear at niner or

535
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,479
negative is really trying to get things

536
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,200
right so appreciate it

537
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,799
um second comment is the requirements

538
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,600
i've seen general requirements i looked

539
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,918
at it

540
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
um i don't know if we you know if it's

541
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,159
looking at it even

542
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,840
per use case a lot of the technologies

543
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,679
we deployed in the past you know were

544
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,199
use case driven requirements for use

545
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,559
case specific

546
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,120
i don't know if i mean maybe i didn't

547
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,440
read it so so i'm guilty here but

548
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,639
i when i scan through it i noticed that

549
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
the requirements are

550
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,480
you know lumped into one bucket you know

551
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,760
in different areas but it's all under

552
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,520
one umbrella

553
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,120
and i don't know if per use case might

554
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
be more beneficial i mean that's

555
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,239
something the design team can look at

556
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,158
um the third thing is i mean you have to

557
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
be we have to be ready for the outcome

558
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,159
you know there's consensus is great if

559
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,678
there's no consensus

560
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,960
what do we do so that's something we

561
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,640
need to think about we don't want to

562
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,039
wait for the last minute and start you

563
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,440
know

564
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,720
shoveling and you know doing other stuff

565
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
so let's be ready you know there's

566
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,559
consensus we're all

567
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
you know so it's a win-win if it's not

568
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
we need to go forward

569
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,320
and figure out what to do and that's

570
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,559
something we need to think about upfront

571
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
i'm good that was my comments thanks

572
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,879
before we continue

573
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,639
we need to cut this cue um we should

574
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,159
have said something sooner because it's

575
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
clearly too long

576
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,000
when we need to get on to the next

577
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,240
presentation so

578
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
andrew i'm sure you have more to say can

579
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
we ask you

580
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,959
to please wait until after the next one

581
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,720
but we'll let vim who's on the

582
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,720
okay vince pulled himself off k.o you

583
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,320
get the last word for now

584
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
we'll do the next presentation and then

585
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,600
we'll open it up to the floor

586
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,200
all right can you hear me yes yes we can

587
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,039
i'm going to keep it very short i have

588
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,840
three comments or three points to make

589
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,679
one is thank you design team but hoping

590
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,678
to really see some consensus b

591
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,440
the draft needs work clearly everybody

592
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,240
has said i don't need to enumerate on

593
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,720
that

594
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,400
please get the draft in shape and three

595
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,080
i look at the appendix

596
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,919
i look at some of the requirements and

597
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,840
to lewis point if

598
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,440
if there is no consensus i want the

599
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
working group at least to know we at

600
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,039
arcus have

601
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,440
running code on on a solution that is

602
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,120
based on srv6 and minimally we like to

603
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
see that move forward

604
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,559
uh happy to see if there are other

605
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,320
solutions but that is the solution we

606
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,000
are working forwards

607
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,559
know that design team you guys are

608
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,320
working on it which we always appreciate

609
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,559
but we have a working code and we like

610
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,720
to see a consensus soon thank you so

611
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,720
much

612
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,158
okay uh waiting bruno will now bring up

613
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,279
the other presentation

614
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,200
and you can then go through that and we

615
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,720
will take questions on this presentation

616
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,159
at the end of the presentation so you

617
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,960
can put yourself on the queue whenever

618
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
you like

619
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,080
but we're not going to start taking

620
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,360
questions until he's had a chance to go

621
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,520
through it

622
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,279
yeah and wei chang if you could try to

623
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,720
be as quick as you can but uh

624
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,480
just bearing in mind we've we've got

625
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,440
about 30 minutes now so we want to make

626
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,799
sure we have

627
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:18,159
some time for discussion yeah okay

628
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,158
i will okay so uh next page

629
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,720
i i think it uh yeah this document uh

630
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,720
focus on the requirement like next page

631
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,080
yeah and uh just now someone asked

632
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,639
if there are uh use case or something

633
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,520
like that

634
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,799
i think it this figure here choose the

635
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,240
packet to hide with

636
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:45,440
sih it's obviously if a strict pass

637
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,799
te is deployed the seed list

638
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,760
will be too long example eight

639
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:57,039
hops will take about 128 bytes to list

640
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,120
more there are several proposed

641
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:04,158
methods to reduce the resulting isabe

642
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,678
6 encapsulation size by

643
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,960
comprising the seed list in the

644
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,480
working group now so i think some

645
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,120
use cases have been provided

646
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,120
in a working group already next page

647
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
so here is uh the overview of the

648
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
requirement

649
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,679
draft now there are three aspects

650
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,960
of the requirements srb6 seed list

651
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,679
comprision requirements the srv6

652
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
specific

653
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
requirements and the protocol design

654
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,200
requirements

655
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,719
as well as we had the appendix

656
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,840
which included some requirement items

657
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,360
without unanimous

658
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,559
uh concerns within design team

659
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,600
the figure uh

660
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,360
the items with uh uh

661
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,760
right flag uh is loser uh which we have

662
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,719
been

663
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:10,799
agreed uh the one with the green flag

664
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,880
are those uh without uh

665
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:17,500
unanimous uh concerns within design team

666
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,880
next page

667
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,080
[Music]

668
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,279
so let's go uh yeah next page

669
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,799
uh firstly uh is uh about

670
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,000
the encapsulation hider uh i think

671
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:36,000
obviously this is uh a basic

672
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,480
requirement uh it uh

673
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:46,159
requires a solution to reduce the size

674
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,159
of i76 encapsulation hide the next page

675
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,399
so forwarding uh efficiency

676
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,199
and uh we would like a record as a

677
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,439
number

678
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,799
of the uh hider's password

679
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:06,559
during the processing of the second list

680
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:10,320
and the number of the flip lookups

681
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:14,960
during the processing of a segment list

682
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,960
for different proposals next page

683
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,239
so the stator efficiency

684
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,039
we hope the compression solution should

685
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,880
minimize

686
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,960
minimize the amount of the additional

687
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:35,279
forwarding seat stored and note

688
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:39,200
next next page

689
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:43,600
for the seedless lens the compression

690
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,720
mechanism must be able to represent

691
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,000
sr pass data contain

692
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,519
up to 16 segments uh i think this

693
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,279
requirement uh we

694
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,320
had a lot of discussion and uh

695
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,840
there are some input from different

696
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,200
operators then we think a 16 segment is

697
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,918
enough

698
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
next page

699
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,519
so for the seeded summarization

700
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:21,440
i think summarization of a segment

701
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,480
is a key benefit of srv6

702
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,399
compared to sr nprs

703
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,240
so in the implement deployment

704
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:37,600
any node can reach any other node

705
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,600
through a single prefix segment without

706
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,279
summarization for the router

707
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,840
seats must be leaked and additional

708
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:54,159
global prefix segment is required

709
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,279
for each domain border so

710
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,159
we the design team uh

711
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,799
think this is a necessary requirement

712
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,799
next page

713
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:11,840
so for the lossless compression

714
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,960
uh of course the

715
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:20,080
comprise the seed list must

716
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:24,559
be equivalent to the original state list

717
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:29,439
for example a strict past de

718
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:33,918
cannot be comprised to a loose pasty

719
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,919
seed list the next page

720
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,320
so for the urgency segment

721
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,960
scale now we hope

722
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,960
it can be capable of

723
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:55,039
65 key agency segments

724
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,080
per node but typically maybe

725
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:02,158
network operators deploy a network

726
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,678
with such as the tens or hundreds of

727
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,799
segments per node is enough but for some

728
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,240
quantities

729
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:14,960
we really need a large

730
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,959
agency segment list next page

731
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,079
for the prefix sig segment scale

732
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,159
i think we hope the comprising

733
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:32,560
mechanism can be

734
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,879
representing one million prefix segment

735
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,960
of course for the typical applicant

736
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,000
scenario

737
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,520
we may need a deploy

738
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,560
network with thousands of

739
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,599
prefix segments but

740
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,960
we have to meet the corner case

741
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,960
requirement next

742
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,520
for the service scale

743
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,560
uh similar to the other two

744
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,160
the compression mechanism

745
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,520
must be able for representing

746
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,240
one million service per node

747
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,240
next page

748
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,799
uh this is for the srv6 base

749
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,640
uh co existence so

750
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,880
we hope the compression

751
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:35,040
solution can support deployment

752
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,400
in existing assad 6 network

753
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,680
so this figure shows the applicant

754
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,040
scenario

755
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,480
the path maybe

756
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,640
only support the

757
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:54,720
original i76 or comprise the srv6

758
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,560
it will not mix the in one pass

759
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,560
okay next page

760
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,560
so i think it

761
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,959
the

762
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:14,880
next several pages is some requirements

763
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:18,078
items with rough but not

764
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,920
unanimous uh concerns

765
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:25,440
and uh we hope to get more comments

766
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,040
from working group wide

767
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,680
and any feedback are appreciated

768
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,680
next page

769
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,720
i think it firstly uh

770
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,160
we would like to point out the design

771
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,680
team

772
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:50,480
is always open for any proposal

773
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:54,720
when we prepare the requirement draft

774
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,000
here we list the two target one target

775
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,240
is that it's a goal of a

776
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,240
design team to identify solutions to

777
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,839
srv6 list compression

778
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:12,160
that are based on a srv6 standard

779
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:15,920
and we also are open

780
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,200
for a goal of design team to consider

781
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,280
proposals that are not based on the

782
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,160
srb6 data blind and the control plan

783
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,160
so next page

784
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:35,359
so uh i've seen quite a few comments

785
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,720
for this item the description

786
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,480
is that a solution to comprise

787
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:45,520
srv6 list should be

788
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,880
based on the i-76 architecture

789
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,680
control plan and a data plan

790
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,720
i would like to point out that we are

791
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,160
using the word

792
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,759
shoot instead of a must

793
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,040
so even this item agreed

794
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,079
by the design team that does

795
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,160
doesn't mean by closing the

796
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,160
door to any other proposal

797
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,960
next page

798
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:18,799
[Music]

799
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,759
yeah so this one is

800
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,040
about the srv6 functionality the

801
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,560
discrimination

802
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,599
like that a solution to comprise the

803
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,359
srv6 seedlist must support

804
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:37,200
the functionality of isabel 6

805
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:41,359
this requirement and the set of

806
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:45,118
metrics is meant to access a wiser

807
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,240
appropriate proposal that is not a fully

808
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,920
as rb6 based as

809
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,279
evaluated in session srv6

810
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,320
based provides equivalent

811
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,160
functionality to srv6

812
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:06,240
such a proposal may utilize different

813
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,520
control plans or data plans

814
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,759
so i think there are some concerns on

815
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:17,680
these items i think

816
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,320
we call for more comments on that

817
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,319
next page

818
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,280
so for the uh hyper juniors

819
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,399
uh sydney uh it

820
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:36,160
is uh we hope

821
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,520
the compression uh solution can support

822
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,640
a combination

823
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,680
of a compressed and the original

824
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,799
segment in a single pass

825
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,118
so this is a little bit different

826
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,599
from the requirement item we just

827
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,599
mentioned for the

828
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,640
co-existence item this

829
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,920
allowed one pass

830
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:05,200
can go through both

831
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,200
comprised and non-comprised segments

832
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,119
next page i think all the items we

833
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,520
have finished so we will

834
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,280
escape the next step because we have a

835
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,200
discussion

836
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,800
last apprenticeship uh that's all so

837
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,919
uh any questions

838
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,359
uh uh i would like it uh to

839
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,760
uh sorry chair i i would like to see

840
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,640
that

841
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,119
because the design team we have eight

842
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,440
different

843
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:43,119
members uh this

844
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,960
output i mean uh my meaning is that

845
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,160
this draft uh uh have a

846
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,800
uh agreed by the design team so

847
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,440
i think some questions may be answered

848
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,480
by

849
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,520
the design team uh members

850
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,920
uh so yeah that's all right it will be

851
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,560
fine

852
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:10,319
that's fine yep

853
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,040
so i guess we now open the floor greg

854
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,599
yes thank you um okay i i don't want to

855
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,040
uh

856
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,599
repeat my uh comments actually i

857
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,400
in adversely i misunderstood i commented

858
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,560
only

859
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,400
on what is marked as a uh

860
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:31,599
full consensus but i'll go uh with

861
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,480
add my comments to uh other part of the

862
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,400
draft

863
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,520
uh what i want to point out that

864
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,440
i get an impression that uh the

865
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,920
requirements are centered

866
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,119
uh for the brownfield deployment

867
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,400
scenario

868
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,640
of the compressed sid solution

869
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
i think it's regrettable that the

870
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,879
greenfield scenario

871
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:02,000
being emitted and i will encourage

872
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,480
design team to look from the point of

873
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,040
view

874
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,000
of the green field deployment of the

875
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,160
compressed sit

876
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,160
scenario and that's all thank you

877
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,200
okay thank you we will ask everybody to

878
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,240
please be concise

879
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,520
because we're running out of time

880
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,919
john thank you again um

881
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,759
i just wanted to say i was surprised to

882
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,359
see the uh the forwarding efficiency

883
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,640
requirement uh listing a number of

884
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,680
headers parsed as being a metric

885
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,440
that seems self-evidently wrong to me

886
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,879
in that i would much rather parse

887
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,760
you know three very simple headers

888
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,839
rather than one

889
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,140
very complicated header that's all

890
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,320
thank you satoru

891
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,319
[Music]

892
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,119
speaking go ahead

893
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,879
thank you i'm thank you for the uh uh

894
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,960
make this work um

895
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,200
uh all requirements are good but

896
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,760
especially i impressed that the uh

897
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,960
requirement on the atlantic side because

898
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,319
the

899
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,079
the uh whatever the operators who

900
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,920
already deployed srp6 in the wild

901
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,359
and it's a basic base a service

902
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,880
functionality and

903
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,520
heterogeneous citris it's really really

904
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,319
important for us so um please make sure

905
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,960
that

906
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,960
the other appendix requirement to be the

907
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,560
normative part of the requirement

908
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,560
thank you that's all

909
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,920
thank you bob

910
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,200
yes thank you um so i wish i had slide

911
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,960
numbers so i could tell

912
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,640
you which one i'm going to ask about but

913
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,440
the slide that was titled srb6 base

914
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:54,400
coexistence

915
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,720
i having trouble and i i read the draft

916
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,599
too

917
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,839
but there's a section about this but i

918
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,079
don't really understand what this means

919
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,599
it says the compression solution must

920
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,040
support

921
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,720
deployment in existing srv6 networks

922
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,119
well

923
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,879
can you elaborate on what that means

924
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
well this is darren if it's okay i can

925
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,760
answer this one

926
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,760
wait chang is that okay

927
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,839
go

928
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,359
well thank you and

929
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,440
thank you in this picture you're seeing

930
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,200
two sr paths

931
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,480
um one of them is depicted by solid

932
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,839
lines

933
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,240
it has only uh one routing mechanism in

934
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:49,440
it

935
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,680
the ps4h with classic

936
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:57,440
srv6 sids you see another sr path

937
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,520
um affected by a dotted line

938
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,200
it has the compression mechanism in it

939
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,440
whatever it is

940
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,439
um what we're saying is that node three

941
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,200
it has to be possible for node three to

942
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,040
support both

943
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,040
but not in the same packet

944
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:19,839
okay good thank you that helps

945
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,839
okay thank you bob darren

946
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,240
hey hopefully folks can hear me uh but

947
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,279
we'd also call this shift in the night

948
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,240
deployment at one point but that was uh

949
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,720
maybe two not interpreted the same by

950
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,279
everyone so um hopefully that clarifies

951
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,480
it

952
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,599
um a couple things for the the rest of

953
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,200
the comment uh

954
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,880
just on on the time it's taken to

955
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,960
produce this um

956
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,400
i just want to remind people that we are

957
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,599
going through a pandemic and things are

958
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,200
very tough for people

959
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,800
a lot of people took most of the summer

960
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,240
off um

961
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,640
uh during the last uh several months so

962
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,839
uh the design team started really in

963
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,640
earnest

964
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,480
in september uh and there's i just wanna

965
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,279
highlight there's been like many many

966
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,720
many hours

967
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,920
of work put into what we've got here um

968
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,959
uh and uh and i think that uh i think

969
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,200
we've got a

970
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,480
good start um and some good great

971
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,919
requirements in here

972
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,960
that uh that reflect the design team is

973
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,400
is coming from and and the operators and

974
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,000
and people that we have contact with

975
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,920
within the team

976
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,359
the second point um on questions around

977
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:32,319
uh association with uh srv6

978
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,920
um i just want to call it that when

979
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,040
we're when we look at what we are

980
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,440
compressing

981
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,279
um we are compressing uh

982
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,640
sr information it's been it's been

983
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,440
defined in the

984
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,839
uh in the ask from the from the chairs

985
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,000
um

986
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,359
and that information we're compressing

987
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,520
has been called in one of the first

988
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:54,560
slides as the s36 said lift

989
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,560
so if we if we didn't have that

990
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,000
current solution to compress then we

991
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,640
wouldn't actually be compressing

992
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,920
anything

993
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,440
so that's where it's important that we

994
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,319
identify in this draft that it's

995
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,440
actually that

996
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:08,480
srv6 sidlist that we are compressing um

997
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,319
i also want to point out that the

998
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,839
draft specifically if we read past the

999
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,960
first page of the draft

1000
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:18,400
um defines explicitly that we

1001
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,119
uh that we are considering uh solutions

1002
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,079
with

1003
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,520
uh the current existing srv6 data plane

1004
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,440
and building requirements for that

1005
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,200
and considering solutions with new

1006
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,640
control plane and data planes

1007
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,319
and building requirements for those as

1008
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,440
well so i just wanted to call that out

1009
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,240
before there's

1010
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,680
more comments on on that topic i think

1011
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,399
if folks read the whole draft you'll see

1012
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,078
that

1013
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,720
especially the text in the appendix that

1014
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,880
weight change pointed out

1015
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,879
okay let's try to keep it moving ron

1016
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,400
okay i think greg mursky hit the nail on

1017
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:51,599
the head in his very first comment when

1018
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,000
he came to the mic

1019
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,640
at the beginning of the meeting the

1020
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,119
question

1021
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,078
is really for charter of the working

1022
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,599
group

1023
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,720
are we here to compress segment

1024
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:06,400
information

1025
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,520
for an sr over ipv6 solution or

1026
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,920
are we here to press account the sid

1027
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,240
list

1028
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,960
as it lives in the srh um

1029
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,759
and that cannot be restated are we here

1030
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,599
to optimize

1031
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,680
behavior for deployments that already

1032
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,960
use the srh heavily

1033
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,680
or are we here to um

1034
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,839
equally keep in mind the green field is

1035
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,839
going to happen after the compression

1036
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
mechanism

1037
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:44,480
ron one comment here from jim is uh uh

1038
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,118
you know it seems to me that we're we're

1039
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,520
here to

1040
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,760
to work on requirements for what needs

1041
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,599
to be compressed

1042
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,400
and if the design team make a com

1043
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,160
decision that well it's really the srh

1044
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,880
that needs to be compressed there's no

1045
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,440
other

1046
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,599
thing out there whether deployed or not

1047
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,920
that needs to be compressed then

1048
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,760
clearly that's where you would focus so

1049
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,319
i think i i would word it that you know

1050
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,280
look at

1051
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,839
what needs to be compressed in um you

1052
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,839
know

1053
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,000
these existing headers and work from

1054
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,040
there

1055
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,240
okay tim

1056
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,520
sorry yeah uh you hear me

1057
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,118
yes yeah so i wanted to go out uh

1058
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,559
two things basically first of all i

1059
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,640
think right now if

1060
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,920
i at least i've been part of the design

1061
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,680
team and the way

1062
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,599
you should read the requirements is that

1063
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,480
we are actually going for both

1064
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,920
of green and br and brownfield because

1065
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,200
there is a set of requirements

1066
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,559
specifically that

1067
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,558
built upon srv6 but and

1068
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:48,400
there is a set of operators who want to

1069
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,760
actually see that happening and that's

1070
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,559
why they are in

1071
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,240
the requirements document but i also

1072
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,559
want to point out that

1073
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,078
we haven't i've done the analysis yet so

1074
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,079
what we are doing at this stage

1075
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,440
is building upon is a requirements

1076
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,640
document that is uh

1077
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,319
generic enough to cover both greenfield

1078
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,000
as well as brownfield

1079
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,558
and then based on the analysis we will

1080
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,880
see how uh certain solutions comply to

1081
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,760
this

1082
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,280
because there is a different set of

1083
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,920
people wanting different things

1084
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,920
and as a result at this stage we want to

1085
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,720
be open to actually cover

1086
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,319
all those different scenarios right the

1087
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,399
second thing i want to point out

1088
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,359
is the way we want to do the analysis

1089
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,880
which we haven't

1090
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,960
discussed yet is that for some of these

1091
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
requirements what we are going to do is

1092
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,000
build a set of use cases

1093
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,919
uh that on which we are going to analyse

1094
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,760
analysis the the different set of

1095
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,839
solutions that are out there

1096
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,240
in order to then i look at those things

1097
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,040
and to comment on on john's comment on

1098
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,479
performance

1099
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:54,558
uh and and look up uh things even that

1100
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,640
we had a consensus on on how to do that

1101
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,480
because we believe that certain fields

1102
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,319
although the header might be complex

1103
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,720
it's the lookups will determine the

1104
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:04,720
performance and the efficiency of how

1105
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,279
that implementation will scale

1106
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,480
and that's why we have kept that

1107
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,440
requirement in it

1108
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,440
because we believe it's valuable thanks

1109
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:23,680
hello go ahead

1110
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,400
so first of all i think we uh i fully

1111
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,440
agree with

1112
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,839
wim that we do include

1113
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,559
greenfield and brownfield as well in the

1114
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,480
document

1115
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,640
that that's the very important thing

1116
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,400
right the second point is that

1117
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,680
we do believe that the traps is not

1118
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,960
finished yet

1119
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:43,040
we still have a lot of work to do and

1120
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,440
in this meeting and after this meeting

1121
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,640
yeah so this answer to

1122
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,960
andrew and the third one is that

1123
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,078
i think the requirements of compression

1124
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,599
comes from

1125
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,800
the overhead of srv6c right so i think

1126
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,520
the name of the job

1127
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,200
is appropriate because we are going to

1128
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,920
say that we are going to

1129
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,720
solve the problem that came from the srv

1130
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,760
succeed

1131
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,799
so we have compressed srv6c right but we

1132
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
do not limit

1133
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,160
the mechanism to be uh like

1134
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:18,558
sih based only we do not do that

1135
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,160
right we are allowed to discuss auto

1136
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,280
solutions based on fi

1137
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,558
or not and right now we are focusing on

1138
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:31,280
a very general uh requirement

1139
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:33,440
which can be uh like uh uh

1140
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,400
which can be supported by uh multiple

1141
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,599
solutions right

1142
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,559
so to me the text is fine right now and

1143
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,559
yeah that's all thank you

1144
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:48,640
thank you chingly tom hi there tom hill

1145
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:52,240
um i have a i think

1146
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,319
i have a concern around the inclusion of

1147
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,598
what i believe is an inclusion of a

1148
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,880
requirement to

1149
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,000
mix compressed sids with uncompressed

1150
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,200
sids

1151
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,520
or compressed sids of different lengths

1152
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,839
in the same header i think that was one

1153
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,040
of the requirements that went in here

1154
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:13,520
um and my i i realized that that's noted

1155
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,800
as not being unanimous at the moment

1156
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,599
my concern is that this doesn't seem

1157
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,160
particularly efficient from a forwarding

1158
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,200
plane

1159
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:25,118
perspective and i've i wanted to

1160
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,879
to point out that when the design team

1161
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,480
are looking at these requirements

1162
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,559
i was hoping that they weren't looking

1163
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,319
at them in isolation

1164
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,720
and they were looking at the broader

1165
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,920
solution and all the requirements there

1166
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,799
making sure that there wasn't any

1167
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,599
contradictory elements to that

1168
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,400
this does seem particularly inefficient

1169
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,400
as a suggestion

1170
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:51,119
thank you thank you

1171
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,119
andrew

1172
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,000
firstly i just want to agree with what

1173
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,640
some said i really do think that that is

1174
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,760
really inefficient but i i want to ask

1175
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,759
the chairs

1176
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:07,280
this firstly my reading of this document

1177
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,680
and maybe i'm wrong but the references

1178
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,800
to srv6 that are all over this and yes

1179
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,160
i've heard the comments

1180
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,720
before this seem to me to tie this very

1181
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,399
much

1182
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,598
to srv6 as in traditional srv6 that

1183
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,359
we've seen up till now if the design

1184
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:28,400
team cannot come to a consensus

1185
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:31,598
about that tie to srv6 or

1186
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,520
not that type that srv6 when are we

1187
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,760
likely to get that

1188
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,400
and is the design team then prepared to

1189
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,599
say that anything outside of traditional

1190
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,559
srv6

1191
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,960
is out of scope and can be pursued

1192
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:48,960
outside of this entire process

1193
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:52,079
because i i am deeply concerned

1194
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,799
as i said in my previous comments that

1195
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,559
four months in and yeah i know the

1196
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,400
pandemic blah blah blah

1197
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,760
the reality is is that there are other

1198
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,920
solutions

1199
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,599
that have already shipped they are in

1200
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,480
running code

1201
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,119
and i am extremely concerned that this

1202
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,160
process

1203
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:11,200
is resulting in a situation where things

1204
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,240
are being developed

1205
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,759
outside of the auspices of um of the

1206
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,799
ietf

1207
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,440
because of the delays being created

1208
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,880
and as a result that damages the

1209
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,319
technical ecosystem

1210
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,640
because people are not going to stop

1211
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:28,480
developing certain of those solutions

1212
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,118
are going to go ahead they are shipping

1213
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,000
in code

1214
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,200
today running code in major vendors

1215
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,680
routers

1216
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,839
so the delays here i need to know how

1217
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,558
long is this likely to take before we

1218
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,279
get

1219
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,119
a statement from this design team

1220
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,160
because right now

1221
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,559
we do not have a design document this is

1222
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,960
not

1223
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,359
a full design document it is not even a

1224
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,799
requirements document it has disputed

1225
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,440
sections all over it

1226
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:56,640
and this is ietf109 where it was told it

1227
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,040
would be presented

1228
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,720
so my question to the design team is how

1229
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,200
much longer because this

1230
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,078
and the delays that it is causing of

1231
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,240
forcing people

1232
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,240
outside of the auspices of the ietf

1233
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,558
okay um i want to allow the

1234
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,720
y ching to respond but i'm going to ask

1235
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,200
the other design team members

1236
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,118
not to respond to that and unless you

1237
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,598
it's really urgent to get off the

1238
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,040
line because we have four minutes left

1239
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,799
and i'd like to let

1240
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,880
folks who haven't spoken speak

1241
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,799
so greg you may consider taking your

1242
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,720
comments to the list as well

1243
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,610
but wait ching you should respond to

1244
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,200
andrew

1245
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:41,119
[Music]

1246
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:44,799
um yeah so uh

1247
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,760
i think andrew uh writes a very good

1248
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,799
question

1249
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,240
and uh i think

1250
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:55,759
uh all the draft uh

1251
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:59,200
we are preparing uh

1252
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:03,520
is the first goal

1253
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:06,960
is to get a correct direction

1254
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,440
for the uh

1255
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,559
uh for for the design team for the

1256
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,680
working group

1257
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,960
and uh there are a lot of

1258
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:20,078
different solutions can be

1259
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:24,000
deployed but in itf

1260
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:27,680
we have to give a clear

1261
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,720
suggestion to the industry which one

1262
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,759
should be adopted by

1263
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:37,200
the working group and

1264
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:41,040
so from my point of view design team

1265
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,720
uh will do what we can as fast

1266
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,839
as we can but the decision should be

1267
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:55,839
made by working group

1268
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:55,839
thank you

1269
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:06,380
okay

1270
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:06,379
[Music]

1271
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:14,640
ahead song can you hear me

1272
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,920
yes we can okay thank you

1273
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:21,440
firstly uh uh i'm using uh

1274
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,160
liu from channel mobile an operator

1275
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,920
from my point of view i think uh for the

1276
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,640
uh compression solution is it

1277
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,000
necessary uh to be complete compatible

1278
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,279
with the classic

1279
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,240
as well 6 standard means that uh

1280
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,520
in the requirement uh the the the

1281
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,720
compression solution

1282
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,680
should be srv6 based and uh

1283
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,640
secondly i also hope the a solution can

1284
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,759
be moved

1285
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,839
forward fast and so because in the chain

1286
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,160
mobile net

1287
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,680
network uh which we need we really need

1288
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,520
to uh deploy s6

1289
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,558
uh compression soon so uh

1290
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:04,640
finally i i i thank for the uh

1291
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,920
design team the effort thank you that's

1292
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,799
all

1293
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,799
okay martin

1294
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,799
i'm thinking about the requirements that

1295
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,200
have been listed so far

1296
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:20,319
and so far for me looks all good if

1297
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,240
you're in a green

1298
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,319
field approach with a single network

1299
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,040
domain or maybe a small number

1300
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,920
of network domains you have in mind but

1301
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,520
i'm missing

1302
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,160
one for the brownfield approach

1303
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,880
especially

1304
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,200
when you're in a large organization with

1305
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,480
many network domains with a grown

1306
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,680
organizational structure and you want to

1307
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,119
take advantage of srv6 to consolidate

1308
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,960
all over those

1309
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:52,079
and that is the effort for managing

1310
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:55,760
any new kind of sid number space

1311
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,880
and for my experience with just uh

1312
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:00,400
introducing srm pls to more or less a

1313
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,760
single network domain

1314
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:07,839
this is a huge um effort to

1315
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:11,359
manage some kind of new number resource

1316
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:14,078
it has been solved so far for our simple

1317
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,040
asset number space but it has been

1318
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,160
painful

1319
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:18,640
and i believe it would be much much

1320
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,920
worse

1321
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,279
if you really wanted to do it on so many

1322
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,319
network domains

1323
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,839
that you might want to consolidate on in

1324
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,839
a large organization

1325
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,200
so i would like to see something like

1326
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,200
this added

1327
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,359
thank you i hope they will take into

1328
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,400
account the input

1329
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:46,799
playmo yeah what's the reason for

1330
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,880
a segment can be con mixed of a segment

1331
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,319
some part is compressed and some part is

1332
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,319
uh uncompressed

1333
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:55,200
i think stu should have some reason for

1334
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:57,200
that requirement right

1335
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,960
yeah and uh we can take that one to the

1336
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,000
list way more because

1337
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,599
it's a long i've heard the explanation

1338
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,040
it's a long explanation we don't have

1339
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,799
time for it now

1340
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:11,599
okay okay

1341
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,480
ketan you're la you're the last one

1342
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,000
thank you for

1343
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,200
being cooperative about the line because

1344
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,200
we're already over time

1345
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,399
thanks for the design team and i believe

1346
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,680
uh that we are in the requirements phase

1347
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,880
approach is coming later uh analysis of

1348
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,200
the approaches

1349
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,319
uh what i would like to say is that uh

1350
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,399
you know while

1351
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,480
tackling the combustion uh problem which

1352
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,640
is really what's the focus on

1353
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,000
uh the requirement should reflect uh you

1354
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:41,200
know fair and a full-fledged

1355
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
analysis and not really lower the bar

1356
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,558
uh for what you know is already deployed

1357
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,359
and

1358
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,160
being evaluated for deployment with srv6

1359
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,720
so

1360
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,160
i'm hoping that we have uh you know a

1361
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,279
broad spectrum analysis

1362
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,000
of the requirements even if uh you know

1363
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,640
some

1364
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,319
uh operators may like to you know

1365
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:01,839
probably focus on only one or two of

1366
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,000
them

1367
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:05,359
because in itf we have a thing of you

1368
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,520
know building on

1369
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:09,119
uh what is existing you know we keep uh

1370
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,119
define introduce something then we

1371
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,520
improve it add figure

1372
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,520
uh i can understand and it is i think

1373
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:18,400
natural for many participants

1374
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,280
to have that same feeling uh and same

1375
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,119
logic

1376
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:26,079
with you know on srv6 and i hope

1377
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:28,160
you know everybody can appreciate that

1378
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,400

will we need to continue these

1381
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,839
discussions on the list because we

1382
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,200
we as chairs need to see what you guys

1383
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:39,119
think are important

1384
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,640
and we encourage the design team to keep

1385
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,960
working towards the goals they've laid

1386
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,720
out and the timeline they've laid out

1387

keep crapping out um so thanks for the

1390
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,680
design team

1391
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,640
by the way there's quite a lot of hours

1392
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,598
put behind

1393
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:02,078
i just wanted to stress one last point

1394
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:04,319
about the standardization that is key

1395
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,599
for scalability as i already stated in

1396
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:08,720
the mailing list so

1397
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,280
um just make sure that it is still

1398
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,640
considered a compression solution

1399
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:31,839
thank you very much thank you

1400
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:31,839
