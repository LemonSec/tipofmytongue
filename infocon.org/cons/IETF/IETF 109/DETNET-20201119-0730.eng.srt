174
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,120
meeting weekly on mondays

175
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
uh not exactly what sure in your what

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,919
time in your

177
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,959
time zone it's nine at nine a.m um

178
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
nine a.m uh

179
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
my my time zone i think i i i've

180
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,120
forgotten

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
all the things anyways uh here's the

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,920
list of the the people that typically

183
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,839
attend the meeting um

184
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,640
go on to the next slide

185
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,399
so uh the status um we've we've been

186
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,120
working we've we've published an

187
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,760
uh an interim version of the the draft

188
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,000
for people to view

189
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,279
we've merged yang models and we're

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
working on

191
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,000
some yang lint data instances

192
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,959
for various configuration scenarios

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,519
if you have a look now you should see

194
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,880
that in the draft and i think those are

195
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,920
easier to to see the things um

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,279
and that helps us get the uh

197
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,360
these point about checking the

198
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,000
terminology and the consistency for

199
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
clarity

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,360
so we're doing that and we've

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
uh we've got a number of models we're

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,959
working through about

203
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
six to eight models right now we put

204
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,560
three in the draft

205
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,319
um we're we're checking consistency

206
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,518
against the data plane

207
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
uh drafts and uh we're updating the

208
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
reference pointer so we currently have

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,839
some comments

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,320
from rashad that we're working through

211
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,360
have to get the the team together so

212
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
again

213
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
uh if you're interested in this uh

214
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,480
meetings are monday morning

215
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
or you can look at the draft and you can

216
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,640
give us some feedback

217
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,640
next chart please

218
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
so here's a history of the uh

219
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,920
the versions and like i said version

220
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,519
nine is out there

221
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:32,800
and uh that was just published this week

222
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:36,480
go on

223
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,920
so this diagram you've seen it before

224
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,880
um it just represents the the main

225
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,719
pieces of the

226
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,200
the model that we've been working on the

227
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,040
types of configurations so

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,240
ip over mtls is is the typical one

229
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,640
um and we've been we've been checking

230
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,920
out the various scenarios

231
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,680
um for the for various pieces

232
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,519
so the configuration through the

233
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,479
application the service sub layer and

234
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,120
the forwarding sub layer is all in there

235
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
and the drafts and reds are the ones

236
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
that are

237
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,880
are driving it right now and the other

238
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
ones

239
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:18,000
we have some partial coverage in

240
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,000
go on to the next chart please

241
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:27,439
and um part of this is we're also

242
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,959
uh synchronizing with the flow model i

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
there is a little bit of difference if

244
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,319
you look at the flow model

245
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,479
um we align with the flow model but

246
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
because the yang

247
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,000
representation is hierarchical versus

248
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,680
the way the flow model is described

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,160
there's a little bit of difference

250
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,439
but we do have all these elements in the

251
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,640
various pieces

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,720
in inside there um

253
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,920
so if you if you take a look at the the

254
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,079
stuff you should find

255
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,040
these pieces inside there and you should

256
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,319
be able to

257
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,439
to map to the flow model

258
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,440
go on to the next chart

259
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,439
so here's here's some

260
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
illustration of the types of things that

261
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,279
we're doing

262
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,279
um in in terms of uh aligning the

263
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,360
terminology and just going through

264
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,519
and and making some changes for

265
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,440
consistency

266
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,839
and we're just in the midst of doing

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,480
that

268
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,839
so just cleaning up the model as well as

269
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,120
checking out

270
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:39,519
uh the yang lint that it it makes sense

271
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:42,800
uh as a readable configuration

272
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,800
go on to the next chart

273
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,480
and just to give you an idea of the

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,279
different uh

275
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,120
configurations we do so we we have

276
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,959
configuration for the egress

277
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,639
edge node starting on the right hand

278
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,119
side we have

279
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,240
uh configuration for the relay node

280
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,959
and the the transit node so and

281
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
supporting

282
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,439
we're now support in the model we

283
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000
support aggregation at all these levels

284
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
so for a while we had aggregation in

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
some areas but not

286
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
everywhere we think we've got all the

287
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
aggregation in there so if you're

288
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,839
interested in

289
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,839
how aggregation is expressed it'd be a

290
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
good time to look at it

291
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,000
go on to the next chart

292
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,440
so this is just showing again some more

293
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
detail about

294
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,480
how aggregation

295
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,399
is is done at the various pieces

296
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,040
in some of our other presentations that

297
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,880
we do we have some more detail

298
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:51,839
and then how the the disaggregation

299
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,839
is going as well

300
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,240
okay go on to the next one next one

301
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,839
so these are just the various scenarios

302
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
in there

303
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,518
that's probably extra detail

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,519
all right so the plan is

305
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,519
get any more comments review the model

306
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,040
check for con flow consistency and

307
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
general cleanup

308
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,160
and we're adding reverences and

309
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,079
including the a

310
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,079
yangling sample configuration

311
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,320
trying to get to a last call

312
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,279
i think that's the last one thank you

313
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,480
very much gentlemen

314
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,320
so lou and jason are in the cube salute

315
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,440
please

316
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,000
thank you um don you mentioned you're

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,320
doing

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,279
trying to do some consistency with uh

319
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
terminology

320
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,000
and naming and you showed an example

321
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,199
where it looks like you've introduced a

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
new term

323
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,319
uh can you talk a little bit about you

324
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,680
know what what strategy

325
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,079
you all are following and uh

326
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,399
if if you think you need new terms what

327
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
are they

328
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,959
well hopefully we didn't introduce a new

329
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,320
term but we haven't we haven't uh

330
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,279
rationalized that so that's a that

331
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,360
because we just been changing the model

332
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
terminology that's still a bit of a work

333
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,600
in progress but we're trying to

334
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,760
review that to make sure that we're

335
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,480
consistent with the data plane drafts

336
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,439
and the flow

337
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,399
the flow model yeah it's the uh i think

338
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,800
it was on the fourth slide

339
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
you talked about upper and it shows it

340
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,160
shows in a number

341
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:44,240
oh the oh the the upper and lower

342
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,800
uh maybe next one after that yeah

343
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,320
uh and keep going yeah there you go

344
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,880
yeah so the the upper so so that

345
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
that's been introduced right now uh to

346
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,600
to show

347
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
that when we're aggregating at the

348
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,279
various layers

349
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,279
in terms of the uh um

350
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,000
the model i don't know whether that will

351
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,800
stick we it's just new terminology

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
that that's happened in this version and

353
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,000
we've just been

354
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,279
you know working our way through it so

355
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,720
that really hasn't gone through a

356
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,000
comment review

357
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,720
um so we will be discussing that

358
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
you know as we go along i would suggest

359
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
any

360
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
major new terminology you'd be good to

361
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,120
discuss that on the place

362
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,119
all right thank you

363
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:40,638
okay thank you please go ahead

364
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
hi this is jason speaking uh thank you

365
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,440
don for your presentation

366
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,480
and some brief a response to lu's

367
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,199
comments

368
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,079
uh actually we are not going to

369
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
introduce

370
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,160
new terminologies in this young model

371
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,639
and all the terminologies will

372
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,600
align with the previous data plan

373
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,040
documents

374
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,720
and here uh we doing the naming updates

375
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,119
just to make the young model

376
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
more easy to understand for example the

377
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,958
aggregation

378
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
what kind of aggregation and how to do

379
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,400
that

380
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,359
so there is no new terminology but just

381
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,079
to

382
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,520
updating some naming and do the

383
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,159
clarification

384
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,599
and another comment is some supplement

385
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,520
about our work

386
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:27,839
actually uh maybe you all notice that uh

387
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,679
don't go over the aggregation part so

388
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,360
quickly because we have to do the

389
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,080
presentation in the

390
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,719
uh in terrorism so if people are

391
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,199
interested

392
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,160
in this part please go to the um

393
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,520
terrorism

394
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,080
of the uh terrorism and there

395
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,120
we have a lot of details about what we

396
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,000
have done

397
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,000
and also comments that are helpful thank

398
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,679
you

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,360
thank you very much i don't see anybody

400
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,600
else in the queue so i

401
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,280
thank you really for the team for for

402
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,559
progressing

403
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,960
uh this work and now this is um i guess

404
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,399
our

405
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,000
major next step uh to complete so

406
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
everybody is really welcome to

407
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,440
contribute and review

408
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,840
and help finalizing

409
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,160
so let's move to the next uh

410
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,199
presentation which is about the bounded

411
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:29,360
latency i'm not sure who will present

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,000
hello hi this is

413
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,840
from huawei i'm honored to make the

414
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
presentation

415
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,240
please go ahead and let me know when i

416
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,600
switch slides

417
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,240
okay thank you hello everyone and

418
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,080
this is about some update of the monkey

419
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,919
latency draft

420
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,918
and the police next slide

421
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,559
just a quick reminder this draft

422
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,199
is about a upper bound of the end-to-end

423
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,440
latency of a network

424
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
we do not consider the low average

425
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,600
latency or

426
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,120
some simulation or instance of a latency

427
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,639
based on the upper bound we can get

428
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,719
exactly how many buffers are required

429
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
in order to achieve the zero congestion

430
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,919
loss

431
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,840
and in this draft we also do not

432
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,360
consider the feedbacks

433
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,559
for some congestion control and we

434
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,240
mainly focus on given the mathematical

435
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,760
sound assurance

436
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
to give based on some specific

437
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,240
scheduling

438
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,520
that how to get the theoretical

439
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,640
upper bound of the latency

440
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,639
so next slide

441
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
a quick reminder of the current state is

442
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,918
this is

443
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,600
a informational track and the content

444
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:01,600
includes the timing model

445
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,000
for flow creation and relay node model

446
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,199
and in order to get the end to end delay

447
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,080
bond we separate

448
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,200
into two part first is the non-curing

449
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,480
delay bond

450
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,280
and second is for the queuing delay and

451
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
in the queuing delay we may separate it

452
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
into many scheduling

453
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,799
there are examples given in the section

454
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
6

455
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,120
and based on the end-to-end delay upper

456
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
bound in the section 5

457
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,760
we can calculate the backlog bond in

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
order to achieve the zero congestion

459
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,520
loss

460
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
and in the section 6 we give many

461
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
examples

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,000
you can see the detail in the draft so

463
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
go on

464
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,520
and here is the major changes from the

465
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,559
version number one to the

466
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,240
current version number two our idea is

467
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,480
to reduce some details

468
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,120
that referring to archway to 802.1 tsn

469
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,400
schedulings we do not want to detail the

470
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,520
scheduling

471
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,320
in this draft but we all want to

472
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,918
make the draft currently more concise

473
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,439
and conformant to the

474
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,679
network group and the main changes

475
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,440
is in the section 5 we update the

476
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,280
formula for backlog

477
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,320
and in the section 6 we simplify the

478
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,960
time-aware shaping and also simplify the

479
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,000
insert

480
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,640
section to make it more clear

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,039
and one major change is that we

482
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,400
modify a lot in the second queueing

483
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,640
forwarding

484
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,520
and previous version is for the street

485
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,480
buffer scheme

486
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,360
we have many details for the scheme and

487
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,400
in this version

488
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,240
we focus on the two buffer scheme it is

489
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,720
more consolidated and

490
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,799
we also give the delay upper bound in

491
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,000
the draft

492
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:56,000
details also can be referred to the

493
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,880
rgb tsn so we look forward for your

494
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,919
comments in

495
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,640
this main changes here

496
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
please go on

497
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,480
and just a quick information for the two

498
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,879
buffer cqf

499
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,400
the delay analyzed for the end to end

500
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,360
delay upper bound

501
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,960
and the cqf is we have to buffer a

502
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,080
buffer a

503
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:21,120
and buffer b consider that

504
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:25,039
they are switched at every cycle

505
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,158
the cycle length is tc when this

506
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,559
buffer a receive message and

507
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
the buffer b transmits and then it

508
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,280
switches at another tc

509
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
while the buffer a transmits and buffer

510
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,000
b receives

511
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,760
so a package will

512
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,799
stay in this one note

513
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:50,000
at least it

514
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,559
res enter the

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,080
buffer in one cycle and the leaves on

516
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,879
the next cycle

517
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,039
so we can calculate the one hope delay

518
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,159
is from 0 to 2 dc

519
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,960
and also the end to end delay bond is

520
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,480
from the

521
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,080
k minus 2 tc and with the

522
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,600
maximum end-to-end delays ktc

523
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,639
also we can have the delay jitter it's

524
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,719
no more than 2tc

525
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,240
so this is a quick information for the

526
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,120
two buffer cqf

527
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,120
delay bond and let's go on

528
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,799
and for the final steps and i'm

529
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,400
sorry to stay the final but we are doing

530
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,360
the consistency check

531
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,480
with the other workgroup drafts and from

532
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,799
the other side

533
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
we think the content of the draft is

534
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,200
stable currently

535
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,320
and we welcome any input from the work

536
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
group

537
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
so do you think it is possible for the

538
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,320
status

539
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,199
to ask for the workgroup last call

540
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,918
so that is the current state of this

541
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:05,840
draft

542
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,840
thank you

543
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,960
thank you thank you uh thank you for the

544
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,000
presentation

545
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,600
and um i think uh

546
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,480
it's we should discuss going for a

547
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,879
working group

548
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:26,159
last call for me it looks very good

549
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,559
that there is progress what is the view

550
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
from

551
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,720
from the working group is there any

552
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:35,199
any objection to go to working group

553
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,200
last school

554
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,360
please go ahead

555
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,240
this is cesar speaking i have reviewed

556
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,000
the updated document

557
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,120
and i think it is reasonable to clarify

558
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
and simplify the contents of shipping

559
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
mechanisms because

560
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,240
which are not defined in the ipf

561
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
community

562
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,679
so i'm i think it's the documentary

563
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,679
in good shape thank you

564
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,159
thank you for the feedback it's always

565
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,840
good to have feedback

566
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,840
anybody else

567
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,678
not hearing anybody it sounds

568
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,360
like a good move to to go to

569
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,520
glasgow so we will uh

570
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,918
[Music]

571
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,400
synchronize on that uh among chairs and

572
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,400
authors

573
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,600
thank you let's go to the next uh

574
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,520
thank you thank you very much let's go

575
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,918
to the next

576
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,918
draft

577
00:25:49,039 --> 00:26:00,240
who will talk for the microburst

578
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,360
hello hi hello yes i can hear you

579
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,720
good i'm tom hondu from china mobile

580
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:11,279
i have a project this uh iot

581
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,880
build a description of this in size

582
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,240
okay hello everyone this

583
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,679
slide is about a micro bus

584
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,039
decreasing in layer 3 network for

585
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,440
those low latency traffic next slide

586
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
please

587
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,640
the thread above the motivation

588
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,600
i'll care about the faulty battery

589
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,039
network

590
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,639
this finger is a 4g system

591
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
which controls the control plan and the

592
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,960
data plan and

593
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,399
we can see that there is a

594
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,400
transport network on the rg system

595
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,840
they are used to provide connection

596
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,480
service for

597
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,600
object display under control plan and

598
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,799
though not in the standardization scope

599
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,399
of 3dpp

600
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,279
uh some of the lg requirements also

601
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,559
motivates the

602
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:18,000
solution of the repairing network

603
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:21,840
this this spiral and network is often

604
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,840
ip based next one please

605
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,279
this does corrobor describe the

606
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:36,799
deterministic requirement in

607
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:40,159
lg very network the uric

608
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,520
is one of the key aspects in 4g

609
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,640
it is a requirement so that

610
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:50,399
the transport network mentioned

611
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,520
in the last page and also i need to

612
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,479
provide low latency service however it

613
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,918
is very hard

614
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:01,120
for the uh repairing and to provide a

615
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,000
deterministic service because

616
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,439
the traditional heat network are based

617
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,960
on uh static

618
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,919
statistical uh multiplexing and cannot

619
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
can only provide the ef service they are

620
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
short of

621
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,120
the sra guaranteed mechanisms

622
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,120
next line please

623
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,000
this style is about the related works in

624
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,000
algebra e and itf uh

625
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,720
asm task group has contained many

626
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,240
projects for

627
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:44,000
providing a deterministic service us

628
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,520
through the so2 networks

629
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,799
uh there are some uh uh

630
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,158
characteristics about it and the idea of

631
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,039
that networking group

632
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,440
also have done a lot of jobs to enable

633
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,440
this

634
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,559
uh deterministic it to operate over

635
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
there to our layer three segment uh

636
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,240
however

637
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,760
the tenet now is supposed to working uh

638
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,399
to work in

639
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
campus-wide networks and private ones

640
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,479
and not

641
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,679
power the uh very very large scale

642
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,399
asp network scenario in summary

643
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,600
there are some residual gaps for lgbt

644
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:27,840
network to become

645
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,840
communistic next slide please

646
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
question there is that all right

647
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:37,279
on the previous slide please go ahead

648
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,120
yeah you say that it's uh that net is

649
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,799
targeted for campus

650
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:50,080
um i'm not sure we've uh seen that

651
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,200
the scope uh certainly signal

652
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,678
administrative domain

653
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,880
is our scope uh it doesn't the single

654
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,760
administrative domain

655
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,600
could be small it could be very large um

656
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,640
so i'm not sure what

657
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,080
uh comment you're making there

658
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,000
and i don't think uh

659
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,439
to the base of my understanding perhaps

660
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,559
some misunderstanding here

661
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,600
but uh i think uh

662
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:21,039
the the teasing

663
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,559
mechanism is not designed for

664
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:29,760
a large scale as his network

665
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:32,879
is it okay i'm talking about net not tsm

666
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,760
so net you know

667
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
tsn might be have a more narrow scope

668
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
but

669
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,880
that net its scope is

670
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,200
not based on the size of the network

671
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,600
it's based on distribution of control

672
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,559
but

673
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,559
administrative control

674
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,480
we can we can discuss it more on on the

675
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,480
list but i i think there's a little

676
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,600
confusion there on the dead network

677
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,279
about the scope um okay

678
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,480
okay yeah i fully agree with with lou

679
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,640
actually that um

680
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,880
our charter says uh uh significant

681
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
word by word single administrator

682
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
controller within a closed loop of

683
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,279
administrative control

684
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,080
and i think an isp network is absolutely

685
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,279
in scope of

686
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,600
that not so there may be uh

687
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,120
misunderstanding in the charter campus

688
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,840
is just an example

689
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:31,678
but i think it is in scope of that

690
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,399
but yeah that's discussed on the on the

691
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,840
list further or clarify this

692
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:41,600
later so okay please

693
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,879
thank you but i think

694
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,600
uh the

695
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,039
uh

696
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,480
[Music]

697
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,080
this at this page we show some gaps for

698
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,240
large scale layer 3 feminist network

699
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,840
uh currently we are short of a common

700
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,080
and a neutral

701
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,799
mechanism that can provide deterministic

702
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,480
transport in fairly barren network

703
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,720
and that is used we uh

704
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,519
craft for this large-scale deadness

705
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,640
they provide a potential solution based

706
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,240
on some enhancement

707
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,919
to secure intelligence we think it is a

708
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,919
good explanation

709
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,600
and we think that a tsm mechanism are

710
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,120
designed for their true network

711
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,480
originally and cannot be directly used

712
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,719
in the large-scale layer 3 network

713
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,679
the reason the main reason is about is

714
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,960
about the

715
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,200
simplicity and the scalability the

716
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,279
former can ensure that the mechanism is

717
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,600
easy to deploy another second

718
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,200
is to ensure that the mechanism is able

719
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:57,840
to fulfill complex

720
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,840
requirements next next is freeze

721
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,158
this page will show some

722
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,918
uh reason why nc mechanism cannot be

723
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,039
directly used in large-scale

724
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,640
layer 3 network the first one is

725
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,279
some testing mechanisms need a

726
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,360
secondation or network equipment

727
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,360
which is hard in large network

728
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,799
please see that it brings in some

729
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,918
complex maintenance

730
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,480
jobs across a large distance

731
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,039
the jobs are not needed before and the

732
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,080
second

733
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,158
is comparison mechanism

734
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,199
in the per flow state in the food

735
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,960
implant

736
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,840
which is unscalable uh

737
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
the third is that uh marketing the tsm

738
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,279
mechanism

739
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,399
is a constant and a foreseeable traffic

740
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,880
characteristic

741
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,239
that is more compacted in a large

742
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,120
network

743
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,519
which include much more flows going in

744
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,600
and

745
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,000
living randomly and the traffic

746
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,120
characteristics are more dynamic

747
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,120
next page please

748
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,480
uh when we are seeking the problem in

749
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,960
current

750
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
epi voting mechanism we find that the

751
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,040
main problem is that

752
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,240
in the current network a long delay in

753
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,279
doing or

754
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,239
unpackaged losses due to us are

755
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,960
accessible but

756
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,839
is unacceptable in the deterministic

757
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,280
forwarding

758
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,000
uh even be given a higher priority

759
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
a packet can experience a long investing

760
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,399
rate of

761
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,079
loss in a relatively light loaded

762
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,440
network because of

763
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,720
the problem of microburst the map force

764
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,839
is a special case

765
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,879
of network congestion which typically

766
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,799
lasts a long a short period

767
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,639
at the graduality or in the

768
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
microwave brush a lot of data are

769
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,159
received on the interface suddenly and

770
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,639
the tempered requirement would be tens

771
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,320
or

772
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,400
hundreds of the average randomized

773
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
requirement or even you see the

774
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,440
interface spanners

775
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
next phase please

776
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,640
it's a video about the introduction of

777
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,320
the microbots

778
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,118
on the left finger we can see that

779
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,520
uh if we observe the traffic utilization

780
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,720
benefit on the interface at the gradual

781
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,560
granularity of per second a small scroll

782
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,078
may be obtained but we when we

783
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,560
observe the traffic utilization

784
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,800
fundamental under the graduality of

785
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,920
a millisecond we can see microbrews on

786
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,240
the interface

787
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,320
uh in most cases the brushed uh the

788
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,720
buffer on the equipment can handle the

789
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,760
microburst however but in some corner

790
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,640
case microbursts

791
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,599
bring in a long delay or even loss

792
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,598
next page please

793
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,119
this video analysis some houses of the

794
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,560
microbiota

795
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,800
epi traffic as an instinct is no matter

796
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,640
in micro or micro aspect

797
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,720
it is to see that it does not have a

798
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,520
constant traffic model

799
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,240
definitely ep network has a flexible

800
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,320
topology

801
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,319
which where the incoming traffic may

802
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,480
exceed the benefit of the out

803
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,400
of screen interface for example an

804
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,920
interface with a large bandwidth may

805
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,079
need to send traffic to a

806
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
interface with a small bandwidth or

807
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,240
multiple

808
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,800
flows from error incoming interface may

809
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,640
need to

810
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,760
occupy the same outgoing interface

811
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,560
finally the ip nodes have been designed

812
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,119
to send traffic

813
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,320
as quick as possible and it's not where

814
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,480
whether the down

815
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,599
load the downstream nodes traffic can

816
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,760
handle the traffic

817
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,240
for example uh we show a finger here uh

818
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,880
before the scheduling in ap network the

819
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,359
package

820
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,240
available but after scheduling the

821
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,319
packet

822
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,240
will be gathered even the total traffic

823
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,200
rate is on trend

824
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
next page please

825
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,520
we propose a potential idea for to

826
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,640
decrease the microburst in the

827
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,960
network in fact maximum in

828
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,920
gasoline can handle the microburst

829
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
problem

830
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,160
for deterministic traffic but at a

831
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,760
relative higher cost

832
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,359
as we analysis before

833
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,760
our draft proposed a mechanism

834
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,640
the same magnum including the in the pd

835
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,280
node

836
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,960
do the flow shipping and the color of

837
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,680
the deterministic traffic

838
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,680
and in the keynote recognize the

839
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,640
feministic under

840
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,399
for interface shipping so it's more

841
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,759
easier for

842
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:52,480
the network equipment to upgrade

843
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,440
it uh the purpose is to maintain a

844
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,160
proper buffer

845
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,359
depth on the p node and forward the

846
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,920
deterministic

847
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,720
orderly instead of as long as possible

848
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,000
as

849
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,839
in the current ip forwarding

850
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,160
our first job includes first we need for

851
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,040
we need a mechanism in control plan to

852
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,040
guarantee

853
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,320
the total benefits on the interface node

854
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,359
is not exceeded

855
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,119
secondly we need a convenience way to

856
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,799
for the service to inform the network

857
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,040
about the bandwidth they needed

858
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,720
they need suddenly the deterministic

859
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,580
traffic should be colored so that

860
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,720
the keynote can recognize them

861
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:34,000
[Music]

862
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,000
next page please

863
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,839
that's all for thanks for listening and

864
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,839
welcome for comments

865
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,200
please go ahead yes balance berger

866
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,920
speaking uh

867
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,598
just a question for clarification so

868
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,000
have you considered

869
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,880
what is the cost of eliminating this

870
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,839
microburst

871
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,280
as you're proposing so it is provided by

872
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,359
additional delay that will

873
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,280
come with jitter for the death net flow

874
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:11,119
so have you considered that effect

875
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,440
um i think

876
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,560
in our understanding that the tsm

877
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,040
mechanism

878
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,400
perhaps can handle the microburst

879
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,440
problem but

880
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,119
at a relatively higher cost and

881
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,640
our purpose is to increase

882
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,440
microbursts at a lower cost uh

883
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,118
that's some simple uh idea to

884
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:41,680
uh closer load it is a perfect uh

885
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,040
transport is it okay

886
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,680
i i think we need some offline

887
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,200
discussion on the details

888
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,919
okay okay okay thank you uh we are

889
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,359
actually gonna

890
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,440
running a little late um so uh thank you

891
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,880
very much for this um there's a lot more

892
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,480
in this presentation than that's

893
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
actually in the draft

894
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,359
uh so we we look forward to the the next

895
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,560
version which may have some more

896
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,480
uh details in it um also

897
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,160
uh i think you might be looking for uh

898
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,599
an informational document than a

899
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,359
standards track because standards track

900
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,800
is all about defining either

901
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,400
protocol extensions or specific

902
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,000
mechanisms so i i think you might be

903
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,359
headed more towards information which is

904
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,200
just fine

905
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,920
but we'll see as you get more content

906
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,919
into the draft

907
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,079
okay thank you next yes

908
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,000
i'm sorry

909
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,200
yeah if you don't mind taking it to the

910
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,620
the list

911
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,118
just because we are running

912
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:49,440
[Music]

913
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:53,680
thank you thank you so oem is the next

914
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,880
okay i'm ready let's go ahead

915
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,000
okay um okay hello uh

916
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,640
i'm uh greg mursky and uh i'm presenting

917
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,839
this work

918
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,598
on behalf of uh the group of the offers

919
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,720
um we had a discussion

920
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:16,240
uh of their document that was

921
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:19,680
uh this presented in a reliable

922
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,040
wireless raw working group and

923
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,078
agreed that um we'll work

924
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,319
on new document uh

925
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,079
to be discussed and worked in that net

926
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,680
that will

927
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,880
be a common oem uh

928
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,160
features that are common for that net

929
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,640
and the raw

930
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
and uh the document that will be

931
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,319
continuing working

932
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,200
uh in the world working group will uh

933
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,599
concentrate

934
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,399
on this technical uh technological

935
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,040
specifics

936
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:57,040
of wireless and oem in the wireless

937
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,040
reliable network our next slide please

938
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,480
so uh the structure is document pretty

939
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,078
uh standard

940
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,359
and it includes their uh terminology

941
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,760
uh oem methods are classified

942
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:17,040
and characterized based on rfc 7799

943
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,040
uh which kind of is active passive and

944
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:26,319
uh in between um

945
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:30,319
we use in this first version terms like

946
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:32,720
uh map and mip it's um

947
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,440
maintenance endpoint and maintenance

948
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,560
entity

949
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,920
intermediate point uh these are not

950
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,640
often used at itf i can only point

951
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,560
probably

952
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,279
for one technology where we use them

953
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,400
but they're more often used in other

954
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,440
sdos

955
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,800
so i would like you uh to think and

956
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,760
comment whether

957
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,240
we can we should switch to other terms

958
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,680
like

959
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,200
endpoint and intermediate point

960
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,319
or transit node and uh then

961
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,480
we have sections that um look in

962
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,079
aspects of oem for operation

963
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,440
administration and maintenance

964
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:17,280
actually that's what uh the acronym oem

965
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,280
stands for next slide please

966
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,240
so operation what is objective operation

967
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,280
it's a keep

968
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,319
network up and running and have

969
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,480
um fault management

970
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,640
and uh performance monitoring

971
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,760
information collection it's a passive

972
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,000
measurement method

973
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:43,280
according to 77.99 and examples could be

974
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:47,280
uh using snmp based on the

975
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,640
map or uh yang data model notifications

976
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,960
or grpc usually

977
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,400
it works out of band comparing to their

978
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,319
uh

979
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:04,079
monitored floor or it could be in-band

980
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:07,119
um definitely out of band

981
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,640
is a more conservative approach though

982
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,240
out of band probably

983
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,520
is a lower guarantee of

984
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,240
um collecting the data

985
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:23,440
or not losing the data continuity check

986
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,919
as you see uh we differentiate between

987
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,040
two

988
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,359
uh functions on the fault management the

989
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,880
continuity check is usually

990
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:36,240
is concern of the continuity of the path

991
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,440
so which if we take an algae

992
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,598
for electricity it's that

993
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:46,560
well there is a wire that connects

994
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,560
point a and b

995
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,879
and examples of continuity check it

996
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,400
could be for example

997
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,760
icmp echo request reply known as a ping

998
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,319
or a bfd protocol

999
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,640
another function in fault management is

1000
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:09,520
a connectivity verification

1001
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,520
and if uh continue using this um

1002
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,078
analogy from uh

1003
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,839
called wiring is that

1004
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,560
we have a specific wire that connects

1005
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,359
point a and b for example red and we

1006
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,640
don't receive the electrons that

1007
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,640
travel on a blue

1008
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,399
then one important operational uh

1009
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,598
function is a route tracing it's a icmp

1010
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,560
echo request known as a trace route

1011
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,000
uh fault detection localization are very

1012
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,040
important

1013
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,079
and one very important thing that we

1014
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,319
need to stress

1015
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,599
and remember when we discuss and

1016
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,800
consider oem

1017
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,720
uh active oem the test packets must

1018
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,599
always be in band

1019
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,319
because if active oem packets are not in

1020
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,440
band

1021
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,640
that default detected or

1022
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,440
performance measured are not applicable

1023
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,759
to the

1024
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,760
flow that we monitor next slide please

1025
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,359
so the objective of administration uh

1026
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,598
functions

1027
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,040
are keeping track of resources and how

1028
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,880
they use

1029
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,119
uh that include the telemetry

1030
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,480
information and telemetry information

1031
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:31,119
is something that is

1032
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,960
uh measurable or it's a network state

1033
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,079
information for example

1034
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,920
buffer occupancy uh queuing delay

1035
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,720
residence time it's very important to

1036
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,040
use

1037
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,879
metrics that are additive that

1038
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:48,000
characterize the node

1039
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,880
but then can be uh combined to

1040
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
characterize

1041
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:56,160
end-to-end uh metrics measuring

1042
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,200
end-to-end metrics uh might not be

1043
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,598
useful and sometimes may be misleading

1044
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,598
next

1045
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,480
maintenance the objective of maintenance

1046
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,680
functions

1047
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,200
is facilitating upgrades and repairs so

1048
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,960
again it's important to collect

1049
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,960
telemetry information

1050
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,000
uh enable network state condition

1051
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,960
evaluation

1052
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,800
and collection methods might have impact

1053
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,880
on the network resources

1054
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:30,240
because again as was mentioned uh in a

1055
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,200
second slide that if the telemetry

1056
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,558
collection

1057
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,960
uses is in banned that

1058
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:40,160
it takes their available bandwidth from

1059
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,160
the service and

1060
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,280
next step discussion so

1061
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,879
we'll have the document for

1062
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:52,558
sections at least common oem

1063
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,040
requirements

1064
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:57,040
include section applicability of hybrid

1065
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,800
oem in a deadnet

1066
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,000
and hybrid it's a methods that combine

1067
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,880
passive and active and we always welcome

1068
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,559
common suggestions contributions

1069
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,000
and want to ask to consider a working

1070
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,440
group adoption

1071
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,720
thank you okay

1072
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,720
thank you thank you very much for the

1073
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:24,720
presentation we have uh two people in

1074
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,720
the queue uh baraj first

1075
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,599
barajwado speaking yeah

1076
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,920
if you don't mind that we've just

1077
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,839
started a show of fans poll

1078
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,839
asking how many have read the draft

1079
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,118
okay oh yeah

1080
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,640
thank you lou thank you let's do the

1081
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,640
show of hands first so please

1082
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,078
open

1083
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,078
did you want to say something though

1084
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:56,799
i think we can do it while balance asks

1085
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,078
this question uh

1086
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,040
okay good point so please uh

1087
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,880
fill in your show of hands it's next to

1088
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,880
the chat window in mytaco

1089
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:12,079
while we are uh discussing the questions

1090
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,760
okay so just two comments uh i was very

1091
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,760
happy about your proposal on the

1092
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,160
terminology to use the

1093
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,440
maps and meeps so i am supporting to

1094
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,319
to have that the terminology and the

1095
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,319
discussion

1096
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:31,520
uh regarding that net oem framework

1097
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,558
um the the second uh comment is also

1098
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,000
related to that

1099
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,000
um that i think what i miss still a

1100
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,720
little bit from this document

1101
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,640
uh which is providing a very good basis

1102
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,919
for the oem framework

1103
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,839
um is that we have in that net defined

1104
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,000
two sub layers the service and the

1105
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,200
forwarding sub layer

1106
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:56,480
and i think it would be great to uh

1107
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,480
have also some

1108
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,079
thoughts about where to place these maps

1109
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,200
and

1110
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,119
meeps uh regarding those that net sub

1111
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,000
layers so that might be an interesting

1112
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,559
discussion

1113
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,280
and that can provide also some input for

1114
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,319
the

1115
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,680
ip and the mpls specif specific oem

1116
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,880
document from

1117
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,040
framework perspective that's very

1118
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,160
interesting thank you

1119
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,839
okay thank you and we should speed up a

1120
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,839
little bit because we are over time

1121
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,760
uh hi thank you underground for our

1122
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,480
presentation

1123
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,880
a very good question because i noticed

1124
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,160
the

1125
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:41,200
this contents are very similar to

1126
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,720
a previous document in

1127
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,558
raw working group what is the

1128
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,558
relationship with this to work

1129
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:53,440
their idea is that the raw document

1130
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:56,480
will be concentrating on raw specific

1131
00:50:53,440 --> 00:51:00,079
and then referencing this document

1132
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:04,160
for uh more general um aspects

1133
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:07,359
of oem framework because

1134
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:11,040
as we discussed and agreed that

1135
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:13,279
the death net is uh less technology

1136
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,279
uh

1137
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,079
exposed so uh it's a better place to

1138
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,280
have the

1139
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,240
framework for common uh oem

1140
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,760
and then have some specifics of oem in

1141
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,040
the wireless technology because there

1142
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,760
are specifics

1143
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,759
and their balance between uh what is

1144
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,559
inbent and out of band

1145
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:40,319
uh would be different if we talk about

1146
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,319
wireless wireline networks

1147
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,400
thank you actually we are in trouble

1148
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,359
with the time

1149
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,680
can we have can we move the remaining

1150
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:53,920
questions to the list

1151
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:58,399
okay i will put it to the list i'm sorry

1152
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:01,200
so and david but we are over time

1153
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,599
and uh we had a good number of people

1154
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,919
who

1155
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:04,640
read the draft please please read the

1156
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,400
draft and

1157
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,160
continue the discussion on the on the

1158
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:12,079
list

1159
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:15,118
yes thank you thank you yeah and to

1160
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,559
both sue and david uh you can send your

1161
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,040
comments to the list particularly if you

1162
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,200
would

1163
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,480
object to adoption uh that would be

1164
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,279
really uh helpful

1165
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,319
so sorry for the short time we only have

1166
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,319
any more for the session

1167
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,160
thank you so that's having the next one

1168
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,640
okay

1169
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,799
uh thanks hi this is um doug crosston uh

1170
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,359
this is a new traffic um

1171
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,640
uh that we've submitted to the to the

1172
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,960
working group uh

1173
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,240
just recently i'm presenting on on

1174
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,960
behalf of my courses

1175
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:49,439
france and you're from siemens if you

1176
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,400
can go to the next slide please

1177
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,079
um so we the slide focuses on the

1178
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,680
control plane signaling uh

1179
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,599
in accordance with the control plane

1180
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,279
framework that we are referencing in the

1181
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,599
in the draft as well

1182
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,440
at the moment we are targeting uh to

1183
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,960
cover the distributed centralized and

1184
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,720
hybrid signaling scenarios that are

1185
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,760
outlined in the control plane framework

1186
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,879
but we've

1187
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,839
focused so far on the um

1188
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,040
on the uh on on the distributed part

1189
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,078
yesterday i'm trying to

1190
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,520
keep my time down um they

1191
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
they what we intend to do is

1192
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,319
particularly solicit feedback that's the

1193
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,599
whole point of presenting here so the

1194
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,558
main focus of the work at the moment is

1195
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,119
section two

1196
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,440
in case you haven't read it um the main

1197
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,599
proposal for aligning layer 2 and layer

1198
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,200
3 signaling which i will have a slide on

1199
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:35,280
later on which is the part

1200
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,799
where we are soliciting feedback is in

1201
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,520
2.5

1202
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,440
for you as a navigation and section 3

1203
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,280
and 4 might be for future work

1204
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,119
so the baseline as mentioned um yeah

1205
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,599
next slide please thank you

1206
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,200
um is that we cover the three cases um

1207
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,160
it's distributed being the focus

1208
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,439
um on after draft the other ones um for

1209
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,000
potential

1210
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,880
other contributors or from us to be

1211
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,240
filled in

1212
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,240
thank you in the next one please

1213
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,879
so um the the draft starts with

1214
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,880
discussing the main difference between

1215
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,839
rap as an example for tsn

1216
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,839
and rsvp this is done throughout section

1217
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,680
2.4 to cover

1218
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,359
certain aspects that that where there

1219
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,319
are differences between the two models

1220
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:21,200
that are applied in in in wrap for tsn

1221
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:23,119
and rsvps assumption network nodes the

1222
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,960
mapping of the latency model how to deal

1223
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,800
with latency margins how to deal with

1224
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,720
jitter and non-shaping nodes

1225
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,680
but also how to map research reservation

1226
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:35,200
stars that's all discussed in 2.4

1227
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,399
and up front we we start by asking

1228
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,439
a number of challenges in section 2.2

1229
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,880
and the foremost

1230
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,480
if rcp insert is the right starting

1231
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:47,040
point for the alignment which we then

1232
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,960
come back later in 2.5

1233
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,960
and then how to effectively address

1234
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,480
those various issues that are discussed

1235
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,839
in 2.4

1236
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,319
and also what's the nature of the

1237
00:54:53,839 --> 00:55:00,480
interface between rsvp and rap

1238
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:02,160
in the scenario so next slide please

1239
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,000
so this is the the interactions that we

1240
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,879
outlined in figure 2 of the 12 this is a

1241
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,240
slightly

1242
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,280
prettier looking version of it where we

1243
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,839
have the assumption of

1244
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,760
a a bridge scenario here from an end

1245
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,599
system over a first router to another

1246
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,680
end system on the right hand side

1247
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,040
that we left out here that's included in

1248
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,799
figure two

1249
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,040
the main interface that we're discussing

1250
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:26,000
the draft is is obviously focus on

1251
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,759
the layer three control plane and we

1252
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,599
mentioned the tsn api

1253
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,319
uh in in section 2.6 as an example

1254
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,960
and that you know that that can be used

1255
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,319
and so the focus is on the du api and

1256
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,520
the dl api

1257
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:45,119
that's shown here in the figure uh

1258
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,680
the next slide please so

1259
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,559
what we're proposing which is what we're

1260
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,680
seeking feedback

1261
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,440
from the working group uh is the

1262
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,839
rationale of the the introduction of

1263
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,599
what we call rsv

1264
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:59,200
rsvp.net um the rationale to split the

1265
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,799
control over the resource style and the

1266
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,240
sender selection

1267
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:05,599
um that would align rsvp to the announce

1268
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,279
model of rap

1269
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,640
um where the resource style is actually

1270
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,559
known when propagating the announce

1271
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,200
downstream so it aligns the model used

1272
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,480
in

1273
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:18,240
in in networks like tsn better um with

1274
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:21,040
uh the the the cycling you would do

1275
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,319
yeah on layer three that's the first uh

1276
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,720
part uh um

1277
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:27,119
that is being discussed in the in the

1278
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,399
proposal for rsvp.net

1279
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,720
the second part is also to introduce a

1280
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,799
another resource style the so-called

1281
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,480
coordinated shared resource

1282
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,160
which would support a large amount of

1283
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,520
deterministic connections with a small

1284
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,240
data usage

1285
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:43,599
instead of using scheduling all of these

1286
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,759
connections into a shared

1287
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,799
resource that's one of the uh the other

1288
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,839
part that we are

1289
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:52,079
we are discussing in that proposal the

1290
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:54,240
api specifications are then given as an

1291
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:57,680
example how this could look like

1292
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,319
in sections 2.261 and 262 this is for

1293
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,520
the

1294
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,920
du api in the dl api that i showed in

1295
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,960
the

1296
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,160
previous figure and the example tsn api

1297
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,599
just for completeness

1298
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,920
is given there to the next slide please

1299
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,839
so the future plans that is an initial

1300
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,839
draft this is uh has been brought up

1301
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,040
specifically to solicit feedback on the

1302
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,880
proposed changes

1303
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,640
to the signaling and rsvp given that

1304
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,079
there are also discussions on uh and

1305
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,319
then work on rap going on

1306
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,280
ongoing and i triple e and in particular

1307
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:27,359
urgent

1308
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,200
and and friends are very uh involved in

1309
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,040
the ieee work as well

1310
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,480
um so the split of the resource control

1311
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,839
and the center selection is is

1312
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:39,119
is the the part um that's being proposed

1313
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:42,880
and the possible goal here could be

1314
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:46,079
to to go for a specific specification of

1315
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,119
what we call rsvp.net in the draft

1316
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:51,920
um second plan is also to

1317
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,040
to outline and revise the dtu api to

1318
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:55,440
make it

1319
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,599
independent of the particular model of

1320
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,200
signaling distributed centralized

1321
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,799
and also add the missing version for

1322
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,279
centralized and hybrid

1323
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:05,280
if the material and we find core

1324
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,359
contributors as well

1325
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,440
foremost apart from the feedback

1326
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,359
obviously we solicit also and welcome

1327
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,480
co-authors and contributors to the

1328
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,558
discussion

1329
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,520
from the melinx thank you very much

1330
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,119
thank you very much

1331
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,440
for the for the contribution and the

1332
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,200
presentation as we are running out of

1333
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,280
time i would suggest a

1334
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,279
discussion on the list so please put

1335
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,400
your question and comments please read

1336
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,520
the draft

1337
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:31,760
and and um and discuss it on the list

1338
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,359
so let's let's move to the next uh and

1339
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,240
the last presentation to have

1340
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:36,240
some time for it

1341
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,240
is there's some suggestion to have an

1342
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,720
interim so that we can have more time

1343
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,160
particularly to discuss new material uh

1344
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:48,480
i think that's a very good idea but

1345
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:50,480
we'll try to schedule something

1346
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,920
right we'll discuss it offline and

1347
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,960
probably try to schedule something in

1348
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,200
december

1349
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,359
so thank you for that suggestion thank

1350
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,359
you

1351
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,079
oh okay this is funny from huawei this

1352
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,480
will be a very good

1353
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,640
um the draft's name is the segment

1354
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,319
routine for the redundancy protection

1355
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,319
uh next place yeah actually

1356
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,759
we have already introduced this one to

1357
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:17,040
then that uh for several

1358
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,440
uh meetings so this this is only the the

1359
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,920
plan

1360
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,280
that we are going to notice the that

1361
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,319
networking group

1362
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,319
uh maybe next please

1363
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,960
uh yeah we take this service protection

1364
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,680
function

1365
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,280
and and from these three techniques

1366
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,480
three data techniques

1367
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,599
so we rename it as the agenda as the

1368
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,480
redundancy protection as a generalized

1369
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,079
service protection solution so we

1370
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,720
propose a new draft

1371
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:47,119
to spring working group and to define

1372
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,759
the

1373
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,599
the uh the segment and also the the

1374
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,119
other information like the metadata and

1375
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:56,480
redundancy policy

1376
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:59,440
in this new draft um we we may

1377
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:02,240
expect more the other extension works in

1378
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,359
the spring and the six month work groups

1379
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,078
so uh as what we have we get the

1380
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,720
comments from

1381
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,520
uh from the networking group chairs so

1382
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:13,439
we

1383
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:16,480
did this uh did this um

1384
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,640
work and we like to inform the then that

1385
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,400
and collect the feedback from the chairs

1386
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,440
and also the working group

1387
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,440
yeah that's it

1388
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:33,920
okay thank you i

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,920
would like to mention that um

1390
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,598
we started to coordinate with

1391
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:42,078
the sprint chairs like i mean that

1392
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,359
matures and spring chairs

1393
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:49,359
on the topic and um

1394
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:52,960
it was uh discussed that last

1395
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:55,520
itf when it was presented by tf108 that

1396
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,880
this should happen we started to doing

1397
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,400
that and

1398
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,040
and this work you should be coordinating

1399
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:07,839
between the two groups

1400
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,839
uh spring is the home for for uh for

1401
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,839
srv6

1402
