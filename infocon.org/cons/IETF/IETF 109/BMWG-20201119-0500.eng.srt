117
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,198

127
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,360

probabilistic

137
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,599
loss ratio search those are all three

138
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,080
uh three drafts of which um

139
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,800
i think it looks like i i meant to

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,359
delete the

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,160
drafts for all of those but they're in

142
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,440
the agenda

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,800
and they're in the uh the code emd note

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
taking

145
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,880
and and then we've got some testing at

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,919
the end

147
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,000
uh associated with the draft

148
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:45,120

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,319
with a open source tool siiit

150
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,840

188
00:09:53,040 --> 00:10:05,839
what you're trying to get to honestly

189
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:27,120
so i just entered something in chat and

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,120
nothing showed up oh really

191
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,839
uh

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
hi sorry to interject yeah there there

193
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
was a bug in me there quite startup so

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
you need to reload the page to get the

195
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
chat working it was fixed at the

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,839
beginning of the session

197
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,839
apologies for that

198
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:00,959
i'm sorry uh

199
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,279
who who was that oh lorenzo

200
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,880
lorenzo from so i was just explaining

201
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,839
that there was an issue connecting the

202
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
jumper rooms

203
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,279
at startup that we fixed as soon as the

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
room was uh

205
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,839
was started but people had to rejoin in

206
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,839
order for that to work

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,839
so does that mean everybody has to

208
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,839
rejoin

209
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,279
i think some people rejoined already

210
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
because we notified

211
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,959
in advance but some people may have

212
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,399
missed this message so there may be some

213
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,160
people that have their jumper room

214
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:43,839
disconnected at the moment if they are

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:43,839
using the meteco interface i mean

216
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,519
all right well um

217
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,399
i'm a little i gotta tell you i'm a

218
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,360
little reluctant to close the session

219
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,720
down now that we're

220
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,760
uh now that we're rolling here so

221
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
um i mean if if individuals want to drop

222
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,439
and

223
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,839
rejoin that's uh and then test the chat

224
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,240
out that way that's fine

225
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,240
um

226
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,000
if i i don't know whether that will do

227
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:25,839
any good but

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,839
um in any case we're gonna forge ahead

229
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
so feel free to jump in on the

230
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,519
microphone assuming you're assuming your

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,880
microphone works

232
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,639
uh with uh you know like a

233
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,320
an immediate request for the floor or uh

234
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:48,399
or a um or to join the uh

235
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,839
microphone queue and um

236
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,480
so then we got a quick working group

237
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,440
status um

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,959
uh as as we know the evpn draft came

239
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
back to the working group and we still

240
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,518
need uh

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,800
editorial review mostly on on chapters

242
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,480
uh three and four so uh it would be good

243
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,279
to get some um

244
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,160
volunteerism uh to help us take care of

245
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,120
that

246
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,199
uh the back-to-back frame draft has gone

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,600
through uh area director review

248
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:22,800
and um uh the comments have uh

249
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,360
from warren have been uh addressed

250
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,719
and uh and a new version of the draft is

251
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,240
available warren

252
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,519
so you can you can check that out um

253
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,399
so uh well the next working group draft

254
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,959
that we've got

255
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,399
uh active is the next gen firewall wall

256
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,638
benchmarking

257
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
and we'll um you know we'll take a look

258
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,279
at

259
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,279
some possible actions on that tonight

260
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,120
um and of course uh i mean there's a

261
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,800
good reason to finish up these

262
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,560
these working group drafts because the

263
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,479
proposals keep coming

264
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,920
and uh you know shall we make way for

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,639
new work i i think

266
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,199
uh i think we should uh most of these

267
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,440
proposals are uh are very familiar to us

268
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,439
now

269
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,279
so we're a little bit behind on the

270
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,638
milestones

271
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,040
and um uh

272
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
and in fact we've uh you know we've got

273
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,680
some other ones coming

274
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,399
up um which are you know also

275
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
in pretty good jeopardy here but uh

276
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,079
we'll uh you know we'll we'll deal with

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,920
the milestones at some future date

278
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
let's just try to get the uh try to get

279
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,199
the august 2020 ones out of the way here

280
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,199
as soon as we can

281
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,839
okay any questions on the working group

282
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
status

283
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,760
all right so then

284
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:58,720
um uh basically the the

285
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
i've already described the evpn status

286
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,760
in

287
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:07,360
some detail there was a new draft

288
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,800

289
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,079
it corrects a lot of small errors in in

290
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
the later sections

291
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,680
but i think i think those sections still

292
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,440
need a read for through

293
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,439
so uh would anybody care to volunteer

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,519

posted

327
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,198
i guess was about maybe uh a couple

328
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,559
weeks back

329
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,839
it's uh version five um the

330
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,520
i sent a message to the list outlining

331
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,879
the changes and the updates but i'll

332
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,240
just go over them here

333
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,280
we added um next generation ids ips

334
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,039
uh requirements to the abstract

335
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,319
uh or the fact that it was covering that

336
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,879
off so i'll that

337
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,080
may need that that'll mean that we'll

338
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,440
need to change it from

339
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,720

341
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
network uh security devices or next

342
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,840
generation

343
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,200
network security device um i'll uh talk

344
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,879
to you over email about that um

345
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,200
we changed the scope to add the

346
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
validation of security effectiveness

347
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,720
configurations

348
00:17:52,559 --> 00:18:00,000
that's now um uh in appendix a

349
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,919
we changed our requirements in 4.2

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,080
uh set configuration we added

351
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,799
a feature table that uh directly

352
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,840
addresses the ids ips

353
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,000
area that's now table two

354
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
we added a description for security

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,919
features to

356
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:24,640
the table three and then we

357
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,840
since next generation ips's ids's

358
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,360
tend to operate in bump in the wire mode

359
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,159
we uh

360
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,879
added um text that indicated that the

361
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
acl configurations is not recommended

362
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,720
for these devices

363
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,360
and then we added a new subsection for

364
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,880
4.2.1

365
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,240
um security effectiveness configuration

366
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,360
and uh this section now describes

367
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,840
um how to select uh uh cvs

368
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:00,719
uh next slide out okay

369
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,840
so then we updated the test case name in

370
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
7.1

371
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,799
and added again wording

372
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,879
addressing ids ipss as

373
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,080
as a possible target that to the

374
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,799
abstract

375
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,039
we updated the objective and then we

376
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,320
added guidance on how to document

377
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:24,640
um a tested traffic mix

378
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,918
on 7.1.3.4 test results validation

379
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,240
criteria

380
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:34,000
um we removed um we removed um

381
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,080
c which um has and i neglected to add

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,360
more detail on this and i can send you

383
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,199
some updated slides

384
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:45,678
for the uh archive out but

385
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,320
um essentially uh it uh we removed uh

386
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,840
see which covered off uh latency and the

387
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,439
reason we did that

388
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,240
was that it proved to be a very very

389
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,679
complex

390
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,039
test that we didn't feel had adequate

391
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,240
validation as to

392
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,280
uh it remaining in there

393
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,720
and we didn't want to do

394
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,720
you'll leave something in there that we

395
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
couldn't uh get behind as far as you

396
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
know we

397
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,000
tested this so we decided to remove it

398
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,480
and we updated or we um created

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,840
um a contributors section which is

400
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,760
section 10

401
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:28,559
an acknowledgement section um section 11

402
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:31,840
and then uh the appendix a we removed

403
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,360
the netsec open traffic mix descriptors

404
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,120
and added um a test methodology security

405
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,678
effectiveness evaluation

406
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,799
criteria section so that is the new

407
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,760
appendix a

408
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
uh next slide up

409
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,158
so the next steps um and

410
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,039
basically uh we're going to need to

411
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,760
submit a version six

412
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,760
but the version six will not have any uh

413
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,120
significant changes to it unless the

414
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,559
working group

415
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,360
um asks us to uh to make make some

416
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,360
changes and

417
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,799
and you know we're in agreement of

418
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,959
course um

419
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,280
but the version six will contain uh

420
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,000
grammar and punctuation changes

421
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,280
the following two bullets um or mistakes

422
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,480
that shouldn't be in there

423
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,559
um and um additions to

424
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,960
um uh the acknowledgements uh section

425
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,520
and um we would like uh version six

426
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,799
um you know to be submitted for working

427
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,960
group last call i

428
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,840
i'm i'm a little fuzzy as far as what

429
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
the final

430
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,918
steps go i know needs to go the i the

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,159
area director needs to review it i know

432
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,280
the isg needs to review it

433
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,520
but i'm not too sure how to get to there

434
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,879
from where we are right now okay al can

435
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,320
you outline for me what we need to do

436
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,799
of course of course brian uh this is

437
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,240
you and your team's uh sort of first

438
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,679
pass through the process

439
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,840
and uh and so um uh you know we've

440
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,360
we've had this we've had this draft in

441
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,039
the in the working group

442
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,080
um uh and for a while

443
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,440
over a year and um uh

444
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,520
it's been a working group item my

445
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,520
chartered item for over a year

446
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,440
and um and we've had you know really

447
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,039
good interactions and good reviews

448
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,600
recently uh so uh um

449
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,080
uh and and it sounds to me as though the

450
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,918
authors have um

451
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,240
you know kind of reached the point of uh

452
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,520
diminishing returns here and

453
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
uh they might benefit from any last uh

454
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,720
comments that we can

455
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,360
uh precipitate by uh performing the

456
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,159
uh the working group last call uh kind

457
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,158
of function

458
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,760
now in in the in the benchmarking

459
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,080
methodology working group

460
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,120
uh very often we have um more than one

461
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,639
uh working group last call uh especially

462
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,360
if we get a lot of comments

463
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,919
uh during a working group last call but

464
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
uh

465
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,320
so we might have a we might have a noisy

466
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,080
one and then we might have a quiet one

467
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,000
uh or or or if everybody's uh uh

468
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,918
satisfied with the draft and and they've

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
read it and they say so during working

470
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,480
group class call then

471
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,360
and it may just be one uh we'll see so

472
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,640
um

473
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:26,080
uh let me let me just uh

474
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,080
because we've got a um we've got a

475
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:37,840
a tool for this now um

476
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,840
let me ask a question of the group

477
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:04,399
so who has read the the next gen

478
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:09,039
firewall draft

479
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,080
how do we uh respond to that

480
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,600
well um in the uh in the

481
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,840
in the place where you've been looking

482
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,439
at the participants list

483
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,799
um uh there should be

484
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,880
a like a poll that comes up there and

485
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,960
um uh and you get to click the first two

486
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,640
button to either raise your hand if you

487
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,520
if you've read it if that's a yes or uh

488
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,600
do not raise your hand if if you uh if

489
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,039
you haven't read it

490
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,120
and uh and and so far i see uh six

491
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,480
seven people who are raising their hands

492
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,879
and um

493
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,120
one person who's uh indicating that

494
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,400
they're not gonna raise their hand

495
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,080
uh which is eight eight people out of uh

496
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,279
22 the other uh

497
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,360
i'm not doing the math uh the other 14

498
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:06,159
are are um uh

499
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,600
uh not going to play along but but look

500
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,240
seven if seven people have read the

501
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,320
draft

502
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,600
and um uh and there's no objections to

503
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,799
uh starting a working group last call

504
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,199
um but then i think we can go ahead

505
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,720
so i'll ask the question then are there

506
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,400
are there any objections to

507
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,159
um to

508
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,559
starting a working group last call oh

509
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,679
and i also see that tim winters has

510
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:37,120
joined the queue here so uh uh

511
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,120
go ahead tim enable your mic

512
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,559
hey al um and brian it's tim brian

513
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,919
i know you guys said in the in the draft

514
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,879
that you removed the nets like open

515
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,159
traffic

516
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,760
did you just replace it with just

517
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,799
regular background traffic i haven't had

518
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,480
a chance to

519
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,000
i'll i'll look at this as part of the

520
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,640
working group last call but i thought

521
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,320
i had you here i could ask we um we

522
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,159
replaced 7.1 with

523
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,879
um with more extensive guidance on how

524
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,640
to

525
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,720
um on on on what to do but uh

526
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
we we've essentially decided that we're

527
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
going to uh

528
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,678
we haven't been able to address the

529
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,480
differences between the uh the test

530
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,760
tools and

531
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,640
and what what uh

532
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,879
and it's it's not within the except what

533
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,919
we consider acceptable limits

534
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,880
and uh rather than rather than that

535
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,039
allow that to delay the draft um we sort

536
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,840
of stepped away a little bit from the uh

537
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,520
from the netsec open developed traffic

538
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,559
mix because we

539
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,918
we didn't feel that uh we we could

540
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,360
defend it adequately

541
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,000
now we're still working on it we're

542
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,879
still hoping but um hope springs eternal

543
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,360
right

544
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
yeah okay that makes sense um i think

545
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,120
this document's ready for working group

546
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,559
last call i'll so i'll now

547
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,918
review that as part of the process

548
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:06,240
very good thanks tim go ahead go i see

549
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:08,159
you in the queue

550
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,720
oh i think i knocked you out of the

551
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,720
queue bill

552
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,919
go ahead bill

553
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,039
okay that works uh so i've read uh

554
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,520
halfway through the uh document

555
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,720
um i do have some grammatical notes i i

556
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,399
could wait until you could

557
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,240
commit version of six and i could review

558
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,879
it again or i could send you what i have

559
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,600
and you can

560
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
use that i don't know by all means send

561
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,879
us

562
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,520
send us what you have i mean if it's uh

563
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,360
if it's

564
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,080
if it's redundant that's that's

565
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,158
perfectly fine as far as i'm concerned

566
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,840
okay we'll do thanks thank you

567
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,840
thank you

568
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,399
all right so we'll uh so we'll record a

569
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
um a working group last call for a next

570
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,600
generation firewall

571
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,840
uh brian one thing i remember you

572
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,678
mentioned was

573
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,760
um uh

574
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,200
i think you wanted to change the file

575
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,799
name

576
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,559
yeah because if possible i'd like to

577
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,840
we'd like to change it to um refer to it

578
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,760
as

579
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,158
as what's in the title here benchmarking

580
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,919
methodology for network security device

581
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,440
or devices yeah usually we don't change

582
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,120
the file name even if the

583
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,640
name of the draft or the title of the

584
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,360
draft changes

585
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
uh it's just it's just easier to keep

586
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,559
the history that way

587
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,600
okay so um uh

588
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,720
you know a lot in fact a lot of drafts

589
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,360
end up having kind of funny names uh

590
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,159
because of that but uh this one's pretty

591
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,439
close

592
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,960
i think you'll agree so uh uh you know

593
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,039
all you have to do is open it up and

594
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,640
and you'll we'll all see the new title

595
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,240
so uh okay

596
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,120
that works for me sure i hope it works

597
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,279
for you yeah good

598
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,039
thanks yeah it's not it's not a it's

599
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,240
it's not a deal breaker

600
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,158
right i didn't think so

601
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,000
all right and and i think i think we'll

602
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,000
probably have a working group last call

603
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,399
uh as long as a month um on this

604
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,880
uh because we've got the uh thanksgiving

605
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,760
holiday coming up in the united states

606
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,360
and um you know basically a lot of

607
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,039
people trying to finish a lot of stuff

608
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,840
up at the end of the year

609
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,720
so um i think i think a month on this is

610
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,039
probably

611
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,159
by a reasonable amount of time once i

612
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,360
get the changes

613
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,720

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,080
care of this

677
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,080
form um

678
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,360
vladimir updated the draft on september

679
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,480
9th

680
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,320
um you know adding a mechanism for the

681
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,679
synchronization between the generation

682
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,600
systems and

683
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:01,360
um like uh you know

684
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,600
he had another uh uh a crack at uh

685
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,959
doing some work during the hackathon i

686
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,918
was hoping we would hear a little bit

687
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,120
about that but

688
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,360
uh perhaps he'll send mail to the list

689
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,239
about that topic

690
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,120
so um so we've moved through the last

691
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,880
two items

692
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:22,840
very quickly very good

693
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,279
okay so the next item on the agenda is

694
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,480
um

695
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,559
um the methodology oh i i

696
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,679
yeah i'd like to i'd like to ask uh

697
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,080
let's see here

698
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,000
is this thing still all right i can end

699
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,879
this session then

700
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,880
so right okay um

701
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:53,840
as uh has has anybody read the um

702
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,240
has anybody read that draft the one we

703
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,720
just talked about

704
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,598
yang data model for network interconnect

705
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,598
tester management

706
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,279
all right

707
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:27,119
oh can you hear me now

708
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,480
uh seems like not too many hello

709
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,440
oh hello vladimir yes

710
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,159
yes i had some problems with the audio

711
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,359
but

712
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,079
now i'm back and

713
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,399
if you want a short update on the draft

714
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,240
it

715
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,319
is a very minimal change actually we

716
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,118
just added some synchronization

717
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,119
which allows the generation to be

718
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,159
started in a

719
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:58,399
certain moment in time by adding

720
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,399
a timestamp

721
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,078
so epoch data leaf

722
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,359
that defines the moment where the

723
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,640
generation of the

724
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:12,319
creators starts not

725
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,879
much has changed some of the commands of

726
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,839
the list

727
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,839
were addressed so this pretty much that

728
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,520
okay okay good and and i think you're

729
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,160
um you're getting some good interactions

730
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,359
with uh

731
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,560
raphael's draft the automation of vnf

732
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,680
benchmarking

733
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,640
that uh uh uh we're going to hear about

734
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,919
next

735
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,279
so um so that's that's good too i i

736
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,720
think that uh

737
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,119
uh you know we'd like to get some more

738
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,839
readership on both these drafts

739
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,839
and um

740
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,680
yeah because uh it looks to me like

741
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,759
nobody's read it

742
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,960
so um at least according to the poll i

743
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,359
just ran

744
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,240
so um well let's let's try to change

745
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,640
that folks and

746
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,479
and help help vladimir out with some

747
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,480
some reviews thank you

748
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,839
all right

749
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,599
so the next uh the next item on the

750
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,920
agenda is the methodology for

751
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,920
um

752
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,279
but one one one other thing first here

753
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,359
uh

754
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,359
i thought i saw sarah for a moment

755
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,599
and now she's gone again

756
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
i guess she's having trouble connecting

757
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,440
all right

758
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,920
uh we'll we'll uh we'll keep on rolling

759
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,480
here

760
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,960
so the next uh the next draft is uh

761
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,640
methodology for vnf uh benchmarking

762
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,880
automation

763
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,879
and

764
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,359
that should be this one

765
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,920
yes

766
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:09,839
okay uh raphael are you with us

767
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,280
ah that's a shame i don't see raphael

768
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,759
okay sarah sarah just sent me a quick

769
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,759
email she says she's trying to

770
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,160
uh get um muteco working

771
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,160
um

772
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,640
i hope she can uh contact someone

773
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,640
else who can help uh in the meantime

774
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:00,400
[Music]

775
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,400
we'll just take a quick look here

776
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,879
in in version 5 which were the major

777
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,920
technical changes

778
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,960
uh basically all of these in fact uh

779
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,359
raphael

780
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,400
mentioned in a in a message to the list

781
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:16,160
a

782
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,160
fairly extensive set of uh changes which

783
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,598
almost amount to a refactoring of this

784
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,040
draft and

785
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,880
i think that's good and um

786
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,640
uh as i said there's been um uh

787
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,720
there's been some good interactions on

788
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,480
the list between raphael and

789
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,520
and and vladimir who have a a sort of a

790
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,440
modeling

791
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,800
uh of the test generator control

792
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,000
in common so um

793
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,280
uh let's let's hope that um

794
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,240
raphael joins us later but

795
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,920
otherwise i think we'll otherwise i

796
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:02,000
think we'll move on to the next topic

797
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:05,200
for now okay

798
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,560
so the next uh the next draft is uh

799
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,839
5g transport network benchmarking

800
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,359
and that will hopefully be

801
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,720
presented

802
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,240
by luis m conference

803
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,240
oh that's great louise can you hear me

804
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,560
yes yes i can hear you well okay perfect

805
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,399
so thank you al so i i will go through

806
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,759
the through the draft this is the

807
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,240
version zero two and yeah let me go

808
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,440
through that

809
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,919
so next slide please

810
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,280
okay just a uh refresh about the

811
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,839
motivation of

812
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
well sorry but i'm listening a bit of

813
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,759
echo

814
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,480
so well i will try anyway

815
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
so just refreshing the motivation of the

816
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,040
under

817
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,320
the scope of the draft so essentially

818
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,800
the motivation is why

819
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,560
because 5g networks are being gradually

820
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,960
deployed by operators

821
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,078
so essentially what would be nice is to

822
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,200
have a way

823
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,480
of benchmarking solutions in a manner

824
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,520
that we could

825
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,359
obtain somehow a better idea what could

826
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,480
be the expected performance of the

827
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,799
different technologies different

828
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,920
solutions that we could deploy

829
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,680
in into the field so the scope of the

830
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,599
document would be to overview available

831
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,598
solutions and to define guidelines to

832
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,880
assist the benchmarking of i transport

833
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,079
networks identify the gaps

834
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,280
in terms of documentation or i mean

835
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,280
methodologies and

836
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,520
and tests that could require further

837
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,160
work uh there will be pieces that are

838
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,400
probably

839
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,520
already there but others that are not

840
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,240
there so

841
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,160
the main intention would be so how to to

842
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,520
get this inventory of what is there and

843
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,520
what is needed

844
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,440
and finally to provide guidelines on

845
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,160
fighter transponder benchmarking

846
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,359
uh just to have a basis of comparison

847
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,960
and a basis of

848
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,000
i mean a kind of reference for for this

849
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,680
next slide please so

850
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,200
i will go now through the updates from

851
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,440
the zero zero version the zero one

852
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,640
version was not presented

853
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,960
by lack of time i think that it was uh

854
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,480
i don't remember well it was in in

855
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,160
montreal i guess

856
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,760
so um in this version zero zero two

857
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,759
i will provide the updates from from

858
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,760
zero zero so essentially

859
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,160
we have added some discussion on kpis

860
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,480
for assessment of the technologies and

861
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,200
we have covered both control and

862
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,240
management

863
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,919
kpis and data plane kpis in the case on

864
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,118
control and management

865
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,960
playing kpis essentially

866
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,640
will leverage on on the idea that he's

867
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,920
been developing

868
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,839
this working group about the this itf

869
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,920
network slice controller that

870
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,520
would be the one in charge of generate

871
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,720
creating let's say

872
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,839
the itf network slices

873
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,839
so assuming or taking us a reference the

874
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:01,040
rfc 8456 on sdn

875
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,599
so we think that it could be possible to

876
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,400
consider

877
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,400
the same kind of kpis so performance

878
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,079
scalability security reliability et

879
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,119
cetera et cetera so probably

880
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,960
or i mean the idea will be

881
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,359
as first step to to consider the

882
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,599
the same the same kpis as a reference

883
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,598
right

884
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:28,240
at least just a quick question here

885
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,400
remind me is um is rfc 8456

886
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,000
is that one of benchmarking methodology

887
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,160
working groups rfcs or

888
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,160
yes

889
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,720
good good okay um that's great i'm glad

890
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,880
you found that i hope it's uh i hope

891
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,720
it's helpful

892
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,480
okay thank you then regarding the data

893
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,799
planning apis

894
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,240
the idea would be to focus on existing

895
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,079
and miserable

896
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,439
service level objectives bandwidth

897
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,240
latency jitter

898
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,480
all of those related with the idea of of

899
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,520
5g slice basically so

900
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,680
um apart from that also

901
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,160
and because there are some novel

902
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,040
attributes being considered for fighting

903
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,040
the the potential kpi to what other

904
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,880
potential kpis to cover could be things

905
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,440
like the capability of isolation

906
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,960
between the transport technologies and

907
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,599
some other kind of attributes that could

908
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,319
be

909
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,319
required for forfeit and here

910
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,960
essentially what i have in mind

911
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,040
is what is being done in in gsma with

912
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,839
this genetic slice template uh

913
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,680
uh generic size template with

914
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,240
essentially least a number of attributes

915
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,879
and

916
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,118
slos so probably from that point we

917
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,760
could

918
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,839
identify let's say potential kpis to to

919
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,800
cover so all the work in gsma

920
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,119
and 3gpp essentially so next slide

921
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,119
please

922
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,560
further updates are well essentially to

923
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,319
start looking at the potential

924
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,359
topologies for to be

925
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,960
smart and and here i i borrow

926
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,200
essentially this figure from one of the

927
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,400
drafts in in this working group

928
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,640
that i think that summarized very well

929
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,800
what kind of topologies or what kind of

930
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,118
architecture we could consider here with

931
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,680
uh

932
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,359
for instance in the radio site

933
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,640
considering front hall network and

934
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,680
mid-whole network

935
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,920
so these are um we have

936
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,160
this um have particularities in in terms

937
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,359
of

938
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,759
uh street requirements like latency

939
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,480
uh bandwidth and so so could be

940
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,520
interesting probably to to consider

941
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,960
and finally to leverage on all the idea

942
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,079
of network slicing

943
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,000
uh and with this respect to

944
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,920
link with the work that is being done in

945
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
this working group

946
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,040
in order to complement that perspective

947
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,200
with the idea of benchmarking and

948
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,800
essentially later on once the the

949
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,799
working team's working group

950
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,400
is developed with all the mapping to the

951
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:00,880
different technologies to

952
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,560
have some means of assuring or

953
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,400
benchmarking that

954
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,759
all those capabilities apply for the

955
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,520
different technologies that could be

956
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,280
identified

957
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,880
the different mappings let's say at the

958
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,880
end next slide please

959
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,240
i would like also to mention some other

960
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,240
activities that could be

961
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,078
related to this one or complementing

962
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,439
this one so

963
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,880
in all this um activity around fiji and

964
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,640
uh there are some other working as seos

965
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,520
working in different from different

966
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,000
angles so probably this could be a piece

967
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,720
complementing all of them or or we can

968
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,480
see

969
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,000
in the other way around so we will have

970
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,720
other pieces complementing

971
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,280
this work i would like here just to

972
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,000
mention

973
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,040
two of them there is a new work item in

974
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,280
hcint

975
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,040
which is a committee for

976
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,319
interoperability and these work ideas

977
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,920
are dedicated for

978
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,240
end-to-end testing and validation of

979
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,520
particle applications over 5g networks

980
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,319
and even ambient but now by now the

981
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,359
the point is only 5g so they are looking

982
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,359
at the

983
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,480
essentially the kpis that could be

984
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,200
observed by the

985
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,520
by the vertical industries and all the i

986
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,200
mean

987
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,440
the users uh of 5g networks so they are

988
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,480
looking essentially to applications

989
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,079
and there is there is another activity

990
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,599
another ongoing activity as well

991
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,800
in oran or is the alliance analyzing the

992
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,520
interoperability of the

993
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,400
this radio functional split when we

994
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,480
mentioned before

995
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,680
all these ideas of front hall neat hall

996
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,000
so they are basically

997
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,799
looking at the interoperability of the

998
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,319
uh

999
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,400
the radio components um so there is an

1000
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,079
ongoing activity also for defining tests

1001
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,040
for front front-hole mid-coil and

1002
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,960
backhoe network so could be something to

1003
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,400
look at as well or to see how we could

1004
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,280
complement

1005
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,280
all that work next slide please

1006
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,839
okay so this is the final one so as uh

1007
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,880
next steps

1008
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:02,400
essentially what we identify for sure to

1009
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
collect feedback and comments from the

1010
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
working group

1011
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,839
to see if there is interested people uh

1012
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,000
willing to participate and

1013
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,680
and provide input and views this would

1014
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,400
be perfect

1015
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,799
also to keep working on on the draft so

1016
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,079
we

1017
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,560
acknowledge that this is not yet

1018
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,359
material at all so it requires much more

1019
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,558
much more work and essentially while

1020
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,640
identifying

1021
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,000
the requirements and characteristics of

1022
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,680
fiji and

1023
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,359
all what we have mentioned before about

1024
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,279
attributes as a laws and so

1025
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:32,720
and essentially to work in the different

1026
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,920
dimensions right now the control plane

1027
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
data plane

1028
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,160
uh management plane and even

1029
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,240
architecture to identify what could be

1030
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,440
let's say the the lines of the final

1031
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,598
lines work

1032
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,960
and for sure to prepare a new version

1033
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,280
for next itf and

1034
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,480
and to provide corresponding updates as

1035
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,839
uh as today

1036
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,839
and that's all from my side thank you

1037
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,279
oh it's a lot easier for

1038
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:09,040
folks to hear me if i unmute um

1039
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,359
we uh we can um uh i'd like to ask the

1040
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,160
group

1041
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,960
if there's any questions or comments on

1042
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,680
on your uh

1043
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,680
latest draft

1044
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,759
uh yeah go ahead bill oh yeah so there's

1045
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,879
uh

1046
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:30,079
from the uh um

1047
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,079
first is is the ietf uh

1048
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,319
the right place for this work or should

1049
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,280
it be rather be standardized in three

1050
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,680
gpp

1051
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,200
or etsi um and a car student says i am

1052
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,839
active in oran

1053
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,598
wg dyne which works on something

1054
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,119
potentially similar

1055
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,040
and then the second question is since

1056
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,960
this working group is about benchmarking

1057
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,640
what do you plan to define the draft to

1058
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,800
support brand benchmarking

1059
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,598
this would require advanced simulators

1060
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:00,400
testing with real user equipment

1061
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,520
would not work well for benchmarking i

1062
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,319
think

1063
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,319
that's two questions

1064
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:14,079
okay so regarding the first one

1065
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,160
this is the proper place i would say yes

1066
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,880
for the technologies that are in the

1067
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,160
umbrella of

1068
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,520
or behind the umbrella of itf so

1069
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,200
for instance clearly all what we

1070
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,280
could be an outcome of this working

1071
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,520
group i think that the home for that

1072
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,240
work will be here in itf

1073
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,359
what is outside probably not probably

1074
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,919
the home will be

1075
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,160
other places it's true that there are

1076
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,960
some blue frontiers in in some of the

1077
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,078
aspects and

1078
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,960
we have mentioned oran so that could be

1079
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,920
some

1080
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,000
co-leading work but i mean clearly the

1081
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,400
idea here would be not to

1082
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,400
uh not to duplicate the effort so

1083
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,000
whatever could be done in in orem for

1084
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,920
instance for front hall

1085
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,720
it probably could be just simply mention

1086
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,880
here as a reference and and not going

1087
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,558
not going further or even complementing

1088
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,040
if they do not consider

1089
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,400
certain technologies because by now they

1090
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,720
they are not considering

1091
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,160
all the technologies all the different

1092
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,720
kind of technologies that

1093
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,558
could be in itf so essentially the

1094
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,160
approach here would be complementary not

1095
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,119
not duplication

1096
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,200
um the the second point was about

1097
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,240
testing with real devices over with

1098
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,520
emulators i

1099
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,720
i think here essentially what we

1100
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,280
we could do is to to define the

1101
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,598
the benchmarking methodology and

1102
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,280
probably we could refer to that point

1103
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,200
uh but i think that we will not enter

1104
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,280
in further details in the respect in in

1105
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,598
the sense that maybe we can highlight

1106
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,119
the difficulties or or the problems that

1107
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,800
uh real

1108
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,319
i mean particular implementations could

1109
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,319
bring into the topic

1110
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,520
but uh anything else so we will let's

1111
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,880
say look at the problem

1112
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,800
from the transport analytic

1113
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,920
itf technology perspective and so if we

1114
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,200
let's say identify slos uh we are

1115
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,240
individual slos of of the

1116
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,078
idf technologies not from the devices uh

1117
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:23,839
that i mean the radio part for instance

1118
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:23,839
so this is my my view

1119
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:31,359
please um bill um who was it

1120
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,920
who was it who asked the question and um

1121
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,640
can we

1122
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,480
uh maybe get a maybe get an answer from

1123
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,000
them on uh

1124
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:44,240
which uh oran group

1125
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:46,880
uh is uh is is potentially doing uh

1126
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,040
overlapping work i think they're divided

1127
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,160
up into about eight different

1128
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,558
um you know categories of work there in

1129
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,960
oren

1130
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,760
the group is the working group nine

1131
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,599
which is uh

1132
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,720
is for a transport

1133
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:09,200
essentially looking at transport okay

1134
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,680
okay so so with with their um

1135
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,759
would they overlap both these areas luis

1136
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,720
the control and management and the data

1137
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,079
plane or just

1138
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,078
just one of them they are focused on

1139
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,640
on transport and data plane at least by

1140
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,280
now uh

1141
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,759
i mean with the work being done now the

1142
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,280
the

1143
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,680
potential conflict in area could be the

1144
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,040
data playing kpis

1145
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,919
okay okay um

1146
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:37,040
let me let me ask this question that uh

1147
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,480
came to mind

1148
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,680
uh you say that this uh you have another

1149
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,880
draft i believe that's

1150
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,799
uh proposed in the teas working group

1151
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:52,400
uh uh is it still at the proposal stage

1152
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,160
or um any you know how how does it look

1153
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,240
toward uh

1154
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,240
toward the path toward adoption

1155
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:03,759
well

1156
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,119
let me summarize a little bit what is

1157
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,440
being done in this

1158
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,319
so in this there is a specific design

1159
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,520
time

1160
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,240
sorry design team working on network

1161
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,599
slides

1162
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,439
and the concept of neighborhood slides

1163
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,760
how to land this concept to

1164
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,440
to itf technologies so there are a

1165
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,400
number of documents uh running in

1166
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,640
parallel

1167
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,680
uh by now the the closest to the

1168
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,680
adoption would be

1169
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,520
a one dealing with definition of what is

1170
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,359
an atf water slice

1171
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:34,800
and another one describing the framework

1172
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:36,799
so these are the ones close to to to be

1173
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,079
adopted not yet adopted are mean are

1174
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,160
outcomes of the

1175
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,760
design team but not yet adopted by the

1176
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,839
working group there are

1177
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,079
some some discussions just yet in topics

1178
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:49,200
like isolation for instance

1179
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,480
so apart from from that there are other

1180
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,879
bunch of drafts but uh individual drops

1181
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,319
by now so this is more or less the

1182
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,079
status but there is

1183
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:03,440
some activity that is uh somehow running

1184
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,359
so here the or this other activity would

1185
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,760
somehow complement from the perspective

1186
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,279
of

1187
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,160
how to benchmark the

1188
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,520
how this concept of itf networks lies

1189
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,078
could be later on mapped to the

1190
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,480
different

1191
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,240
uh technologies like uh for instance

1192
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:22,839
semi-reality version 6

1193
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:25,839
or i don't know or flexible ethernet or

1194
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:25,839
whatever

1195
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:39,839
not sure if i was clear enough

1196
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,680
to me as though there's going to be some

1197
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,879
time um

1198
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,000
between uh you know when the

1199
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,040
when the actual protocols are decided

1200
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,920
uh for the control plane uh management

1201
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,799
plane

1202
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,799
and and and when um uh

1203
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,920
you know between now and when those

1204
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,040
decisions are are

1205
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,400
taken uh in for ietf

1206
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,599
so um so that i mean

1207
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,160
that we we could

1208
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,119
we could sort of take a generalized

1209
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,480
approach

1210
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,040
uh like we did with the uh sdn

1211
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,480
controller benchmarking at first

1212
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,480
and and um uh try to work it that way

1213
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,720
but um you know that that's uh

1214
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,880
that that's up to you i think that's

1215
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,200
it's a it's a bit more work to uh to try

1216
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,200
to

1217
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,200
uh generalize things completely and

1218
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,200
make that work and then for the data

1219
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,880
plane kpis i think i'd want to

1220
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,480
i definitely want to have a you know

1221
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,280
some kind of interaction with the

1222
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,359
the working group nine people uh for

1223
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,559
what they have in mind so that we

1224
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:59,119
uh clearly avoid the overlap if we do

1225
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:02,480
anything in that space

1226
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,119
okay yep totally totally agree

1227
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,799
just uh for qualifying the this working

1228
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,240
group nine is is looking in this front

1229
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:09,680
hall nicole there could be other areas

1230
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,078
that are not covering that

1231
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,118
yet relevant for for us this is for sure

1232
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,799
to

1233
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,240
er i mean probably we don't have the

1234
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,000
answer yet so

1235
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,919
we will see along the time to what

1236
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,880
extent there are gaps in that are

1237
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,119
covered by them

1238
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,119
and gaps that are not yet covered by

1239
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,119
iitf because probably other gaps

1240
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,440
have been already covered so this is

1241
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,480
precisely the intention of this document

1242
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,520
to somehow identify the gaps and and try

1243
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,720
to propose

1244
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:45,839
work for those gaps okay

1245
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:45,839
okay uh bill i i say you're in the queue

1246
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:52,480
also responded uh thank you for your

1247
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,000
response lewis with regard to test tools

1248
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,000
i suggest to compare with the next

1249
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,240
generation firewall document

1250
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,359
we also added new test methodology which

1251
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,680
requires

1252
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:03,598
test tools to support i would suggest

1253
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,598
you work with test tool vendors

1254
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,720
to ensure that the methodology you plan

1255
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,160
to define

1256
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,959
is implementable and impress in good

1257
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,240
ietf sends to first conduct a full proof

1258
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,440
of concept before night

1259
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,439
and rfc is approved close close print uh

1260
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,480
i am quite worried that testing with the

1261
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,960
single i you i'm sorry single ues

1262
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,520
is does not do justice to the problem

1263
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,160
and that the

1264
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,680
document might become a dead horse if

1265
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,040
there is no way to implement

1266
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:36,078
ue benchmarking across ran and 5g

1267
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,079
core in reality

1268
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:43,839
okay thanks for the command

1269
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:46,399
yeah and uh so al i i what are you

1270
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,400
recommending

1271
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,720
um let's uh you know let's

1272
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,799
follow up on some of these topics with

1273
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,720
respect to the um

1274
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:00,319
uh the activity uh uh

1275
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,078
the activity and other working groups

1276
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,400
and and whether luis wants to try to

1277
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,319
take on a sort of a generalized

1278
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,480
uh thing for the control and management

1279
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,240
plan and kpis absent

1280
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:14,640
of uh ietf uh network slice uh

1281
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:16,000
another topic uh decision on the

1282
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:19,440
protocols there

1283
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,559
and then uh for for data plane kpis

1284
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,640
um you know investigating that further

1285
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,319
with the oran working group nine and

1286
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,480
avoiding the overlap

1287
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:33,359
and um uh and unlike our last commenter

1288
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,319
uh suggested uh you know getting getting

1289
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,598
somebody from the

1290
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:40,480
test equipment vendors on the author

1291
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,480
list would be good

1292
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,559
okay no dude

1293
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,400
okay thanks sure thing

1294
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,400
thank you bill sure

1295
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,839
all right uh any anything else on this

1296
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,240
uh

1297
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:07,440
on this draft

1298
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,118
not from my side okay

1299
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,200
well well thanks very much uh for

1300
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,240
updating it and uh presenting it again

1301
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,759
uh luis

1302
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,319
i you know this can potentially be a

1303
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,880
a very interesting topic and and we'll

1304
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:23,839
see

1305
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,839
we'll see where it goes thank you

1306
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,799
all right so our next draft up is uh

1307
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,880
considerations for benchmarking network

1308
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:36,880
performance and containerized

1309
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,079
infrastructures and um

1310
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,520
i've got the slides right here

1311
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:46,480
and kj sun i think is going to

1312
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,280
present for us is that right kj yeah

1313
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,280
hello can you hear me

1314
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,440
hello okay please go ahead

1315
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,558
okay uh so hello everyone today i will

1316
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,400
present about

1317
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,559
our draft considerations for

1318
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,760
benchmarking network performance

1319
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:08,160
in containerizing infrastructure

1320
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,760
actually at the last time we present in

1321
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,960
the itf

1322
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,520
106 at the time the

1323
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,160
draft version is was general two and

1324
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,440
then now

1325
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,960
is zero five so i briefly describe about

1326
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:28,960
uh some updates and then our works

1327
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:32,319
in the hackathon the next slide please

1328
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:34,559
uh yeah so this draft is uh

1329
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:36,319
to describe difference and additional

1330
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,400
considerations for benchmarking

1331
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,880
containerized infrastructure

1332
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,079
uh compared with the buoyant based

1333
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,119
infrastructure

1334
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,640
so in this draft we describe some

1335
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,559
network models

1336
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,680
and then additional benchmarking

1337
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,520
scenarios

1338
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,359
and then solve several resource

1339
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:57,839
considerations

1340
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,839
next next slide please

1341
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,558
yeah so from zero two and then zero

1342
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,119
three

1343
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:06,000
uh we just adding some little

1344
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,640
description

1345
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,079
uh in the chapter three about the huge

1346
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,799
pages sending luma

1347
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,160
and then you can check in the our draft

1348
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:16,160
and then next slide please

1349
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,319
yes and then the uh from the channel 3

1350
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,799
to 04

1351
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,240
so at the time so we add some

1352
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:32,000
benchmarking experience

1353
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:35,279
in the chapter 6 uh which

1354
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,480
that we was working on the i uh

1355
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,400
hp hackathon 106 and

1356
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,599
so in that benchmarking experience we

1357
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,839
used

1358
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:45,520
implement the environment using the user

1359
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,319
space networking model

1360
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,759
and then we tried to verify cpu

1361
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:53,040
allocation of

1362
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,760
native quality cpu scheduler so we

1363
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,799
compare

1364
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:59,839
with the cpu pilot technology

1365
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:02,160
which is a cmk developed by intel

1366
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,200
and we use the shared mode and the

1367
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,879
exclusive

1368
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,279
mode for pioneering cpu and additionally

1369
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,400
we

1370
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,599
also try to figure out about the pneuma

1371
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,880
affinity

1372
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,960
so that we assign the cpu

1373
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,920
of the network interface and the

1374
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,480
container

1375
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,400
into a same pneuma zone or different

1376
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,280
luma zone and depending on that we want

1377
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,319
to

1378
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,119
measure the network performance and for

1379
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:32,079
the traffic generator we use tracks

1380
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,160
at the external side and then we use the

1381
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:38,559
imx strap pattern for

1382
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,558
measuring in the next slide please

1383
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:49,119
and then unfortunately uh at the

1384
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,799
at the hackathon we cannot succeed or

1385
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,440
the implementing and then testing

1386
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:56,400
because there are some errors and then

1387
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,680
our main errors or was some routing

1388
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,880
table doesn't work

1389
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,960
when we send the package using tdxl and

1390
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,200
then we figure out that uh

1391
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,119
uh it is come from the it packet

1392
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,520
floating luries first only the

1393
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,119
default uh the virtual routing and

1394
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,319
floating uh functions

1395
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,680
uh in the bpp switch uh so the

1396
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:21,119
uh or at the last figure we use that

1397
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:24,160
uh or two or switch

1398
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,880
over the default switches uh to

1399
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,520
connect to the each network port of the

1400
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,440
port

1401
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,119
so but we uh try to or at the time so

1402
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,520
relax one and breath two

1403
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,880
or cannot interface or kinda rock the

1404
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,079
packet or to the

1405
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:43,599
uh port so we solve that problem

1406
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,559
uh by assigning uh one interface

1407
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,119
directly to

1408
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,000
the default routing and folding

1409
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,640
functions

1410
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,440
and then the other is connecting to the

1411
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:59,359
vrf1 to the port

1412
01:03:53,440 --> 01:04:02,880
so next slide please

1413
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:05,598
yeah so then this is the our test result

1414
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,400
uh and as you see the some some

1415
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,440
performance

1416
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,000
is released between the previous vpp

1417
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:13,359
switch

1418
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,160
and port and then the same numeral

1419
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:16,720
affinity

1420
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,200
increased the network throughput by uh

1421
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,078
about

1422
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:21,439
50 percent uh and in the switch only

1423
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,559
model is uh

1424
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:28,400
uh just package is uh going through the

1425
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:31,520
uh vpp switch and then uh going back to

1426
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,039
uh directly to the t-rex without of the

1427
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,559
routing to the pod

1428
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:40,240
uh so the uh you can see the some uh

1429
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:43,200
the metrics i so result for that and the

1430
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,200
next slide please

1431
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,359
yes and then uh this version is zero

1432
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,078
five

1433
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,799
so update from zero four to 05 or we

1434
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,960
adding

1435
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:58,720
one more chapter for benchmarking

1436
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,599
experience and then we

1437
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:02,319
uh implemented a test at this uh

1438
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,760
hackathon

1439
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:09,038
109 so in the case or in

1440
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,119
in this experiment we use the different

1441
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,480
user space network model or which is

1442
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,480
device pass-through

1443
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:20,400
or with the scriv and then dpdk

1444
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,920
and we want to verify huge pages impact

1445
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,960
on the network performance

1446
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,079
because that we already wrote in our

1447
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,799
document that

1448
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:30,559
in the containerized infrastructure or

1449
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,038
we can set up no more

1450
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,760
or the small size of the huge pages so

1451
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,920
that

1452
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:43,039
we want to whether it is impacted to the

1453
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,039
top performance or not next slide please

1454
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:52,399
so so we uploaded uh some infrastructure

1455
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:55,839
setting and the manuals in the github

1456
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:56,880
and then this left figure is uh our the

1457
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,400
data path so

1458
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,280
in that figure the trap generators or

1459
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,160
send the packet to the uh the kubernetes

1460
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,400
walker node

1461
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,240
and then uh the network network

1462
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,000
interface card

1463
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:15,439
is enabled or the sriv so that they

1464
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,160
uh forward the packet by passing the

1465
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:21,359
corner space and directly go to the uh

1466
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:25,118
the network port of the uh containers

1467
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:26,558
uh so uh for that uh uh so physical

1468
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:29,359
hardware specs are

1469
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,000
similar what that we used in the last

1470
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,319
hackathon and then we've used currencies

1471
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,359
uh or one master node and one worker

1472
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:38,319
node and then

1473
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:40,240
we use the moto c or cni and then the

1474
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:42,640
cmk for cpu finding

1475
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,680
and i started we plug in with the dpdk

1476
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,839
functions

1477
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:47,839
okay let's next slide please

1478
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,240
yeah for testing uh we assigned

1479
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,680
a four gigabyte memory for each

1480
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,118
containers

1481
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,799
and then two scenarios of the huge page

1482
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,920
settings so one is the

1483
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:11,520
uh the two megabyte huge page size uh

1484
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,480
and then or 2048 pages

1485
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,839
and another one is the one gigabyte huge

1486
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,200
page size

1487
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:20,319
and four four huge pages uh four number

1488
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,598
of huge pages

1489
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:24,640
and then for a traffic pattern uh we're

1490
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,359
using t-rex

1491
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,400
and then firstly we are trying to the

1492
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,400
internet frame

1493
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:36,079
our site uh so the uh from the 64 byte

1494
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:39,200
to the 1.5 k byte uh and then

1495
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:42,400
we tried to the i mixed traffic but

1496
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,960
we we did not succeed yet so that we

1497
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,079
will

1498
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:49,039
uh we are going to test for that okay

1499
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,039
next slide please

1500
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,799
uh so this is our some uh res the test

1501
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
result

1502
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:00,160
uh and when you see the uh result and

1503
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,160
the huge page size does not affect to

1504
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,879
the performance itself

1505
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,480
because we think that the either frame

1506
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:11,039
size is limited to just

1507
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:14,240
1.5 kbytes so uh the even we just have

1508
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:17,440
the pages uh size uh is uh

1509
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:18,399
the the two megabytes so it is uh uh

1510
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,040
just enough for

1511
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,318
the just uh to store the packet and the

1512
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,158
processing packet

1513
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,480
but uh this rejoice is just for

1514
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,399
networking uh which means that uh

1515
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:30,559
the container just have some pseudo

1516
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,479
functions to receive packing and then

1517
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,759
just fold it to the another network

1518
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:37,120
interface uh

1519
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:40,000
so uh the so that we

1520
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,439
need to more uh some uh some some

1521
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,719
complexity of uh

1522
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:48,158
uh to to measure the the

1523
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:52,239
the exact uh the performance measurement

1524
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:54,080
okay next slide please

1525
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:55,839
yeah so this is uh there are some

1526
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,399
troubleshootings and issues

1527
01:08:55,839 --> 01:08:58,880
uh so for testing we have several uh

1528
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:01,599
some

1529
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,560
uh some some problems first is that the

1530
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,679
out of the

1531
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:08,319
memory error or which that sometimes

1532
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:11,759
port access to the non-allocated memory

1533
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:14,480
uh so the for that so we reconfigure

1534
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:15,759
and then the reallocating the process

1535
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,399
was required

1536
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,359
uh and then or when we benchmarking uh

1537
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,559
for

1538
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:24,880
different huge page size so one or one

1539
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:27,600
huge page size should be test for

1540
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,440
each time so when we change to two

1541
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,960
megabytes huge page size to the one

1542
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:33,040
gigabyte huge page size

1543
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,158
so we need to different configuration of

1544
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:37,120
group settings

1545
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:38,799
so plugin settings or kubernetes

1546
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:42,080
settings should be required

1547
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,960
and then it should be repeated many

1548
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,278
times

1549
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:46,480
so that it takes a lot of time to change

1550
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:49,759
configuration

1551
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:52,959
and also to uh it may add uh be

1552
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:56,880
the high risk to be error and then

1553
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,920
uh so the last was worse is uh

1554
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,280
that i told before though we just uh the

1555
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:03,760
using the pseudo functions

1556
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,800
and then just they're talking uh the

1557
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:08,080
performance so

1558
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:10,640
we use we need to consider

1559
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,840
some uh some impact on the application

1560
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,239
process

1561
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,239
and then also we have to consider some

1562
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:18,559
tradeoffs between the network

1563
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:19,120
performance and the resource utilization

1564
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,239
so

1565
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:27,280
we will try to uh to to test it

1566
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:27,280
later okay next class slide please

1567
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:35,679
okay this is uh our last slide uh so

1568
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:36,480
for updating the uh draft to the general

1569
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,199
six so

1570
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,599
so we we're including our result and

1571
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:42,400
then

1572
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,360
our troubleshooting of the last

1573
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,159
hackathon

1574
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,679
and then updating uh some up-to-date

1575
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:51,360
network technology

1576
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:53,199
uh and we also considered to expand uh

1577
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,639
uh some other benchmarking scenario

1578
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,159
which is uh

1579
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,080
for example east west traffic

1580
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:01,599
benchmarking scenario

1581
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:03,519
and then we also plan to the next

1582
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,560
hackathon the one

1583
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:10,000
or 110 so we

1584
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,400
are going to finding find items

1585
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,280
with some implement different network

1586
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,480
topologies

1587
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,960
and or the different test scenarios

1588
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,559
okay so that's all of my presentation

1589
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,600
and all comments and

1590
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:27,840
suggestions questions are always welcome

1591
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,840
thank you

1592
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:35,679
thank you uh kj i i i say we have uh

1593
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,719
benson in the queue please go ahead

1594
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,840
benson with your

1595
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,840
questions on the draft

1596
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:51,120
so i guess i had a question maybe more

1597
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,320
related to your presentation

1598
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,040
um a lot of it seems quite specific to

1599
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,120
the hardware

1600
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:03,040
uh because you talk about new allocation

1601
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:06,400
um i'm wondering how portable

1602
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:10,239
um your methodology would be

1603
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:12,559
there's a lot of different hardware and

1604
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:14,159
uh while numa effects are important um

1605
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,800
is there a way to kind of write things

1606
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:16,639
so that

1607
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,840
measurements can be done for different

1608
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:23,840
architectures

1609
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,840
and where numerous effects also differ

1610
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,360
yes for

1611
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:34,239
[Music]

1612
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:35,280
for testing in our environment so one of

1613
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:37,919
our

1614
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,800
different uh the hard hard thing was

1615
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,280
that

1616
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,840
so even though there are some

1617
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,639
virtualized infrastructure but

1618
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,440
uh depending on hardware or depending on

1619
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,320
the network

1620
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,599
technology they have some the dependency

1621
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,799
of the hardware's

1622
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,760
uh such as uh some uh some numera

1623
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,719
technology

1624
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,679
for example we use the cmk for cpu

1625
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,159
pining so

1626
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:03,520
it supported uh some some hardware about

1627
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,519
us uh

1628
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,120
in case of other hardware we cannot

1629
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:10,320
support it very well

1630
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,559
also i think that

1631
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,559
uh

1632
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:18,880
yes uh they they maybe have some harder

1633
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:23,199
specific

1634
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,199
uh some effect for that

1635
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,800
so um uh kj one of the one of the things

1636
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,000
that um

1637
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,880
uh benson's uh question uh brings up to

1638
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,280
me and and

1639
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,480
something i was thinking about is that

1640
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:44,000
uh

1641
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,879
basically going back to the beginning

1642
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,760
here

1643
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,080
your you're writing what we call a uh a

1644
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,120
considerations draft

1645
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:56,000
and um and

1646
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,640
and uh you know i was i was sort of

1647
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,560
wondering

1648
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,080
you know where are your uh detailed

1649
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,800
procedures and so forth

1650
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,600
but but actually in a considerations

1651
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,640
draft you're

1652
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,679
you're kind of examining uh the problem

1653
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,920
space

1654
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:11,520
and uh trying to help other people

1655
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,159
become aware of

1656
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,239
uh the problems we're up against uh when

1657
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:19,360
we do try to go on and and do

1658
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:21,599
more with methodologies

1659
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,320
uh measuring network performance in the

1660
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,320
containerized infrastructure space

1661
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,719
uh so um if that's if that's consistent

1662
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,239
with

1663
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:33,679
uh the way that uh uh the way that you

1664
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:35,759
wanna proceed

1665
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,360
um then i think you're probably you're

1666
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,400
probably on the right track

1667
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:43,519
but um as as mentioned as benson

1668
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:46,879
mentions uh i think you want to uh

1669
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:50,560
uh you know try to tip your hat toward

1670
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,000
uh generalizations as well and maybe

1671
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:53,840
you know maybe some different

1672
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,960
architectures uh

1673
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:59,280
as you uh as you make some um

1674
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,960
statements and and recommendations it

1675
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,679
would it would be good if the draft had

1676
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,760
some

1677
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:05,520
uh some general recommendations that

1678
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:10,880
we'll that we'll be able to follow

1679
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:15,040
in our uh in in future development of

1680
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,040
metrics and methodology

1681
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:21,919
okay so i i i got you an

1682
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:23,199
advances point so so we need to some

1683
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:26,560
generalize

1684
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:30,000
for that so okay so i will try it for

1685
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,320
for them okay good

1686
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,159
good and and um and it's always it's

1687
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:37,360
always good to make some recommendations

1688
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:40,239
as well so the generalization and

1689
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,679
if you can and then uh some some

1690
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:44,879
recommendations

1691
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:47,440
uh i know another way to go on is is to

1692
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,920
uh look at the other architectures and

1693
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,839
to say

1694
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,080
you know we looked at we looked at this

1695
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,360
um uh

1696
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,600
numa architecture in in some detail uh

1697
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:01,440
but it has parallels to the

1698
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,560
uh you know the the this alternative

1699
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:06,879
architecture

1700
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:10,640
you know in arm or whatever

1701
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,640
okay okay i got your point

1702
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:21,840
um any other any other questions

1703
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:40,320
yeah one one one question i had uh

1704
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,239
was was related to the

1705
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,519
uh it was related to the network

1706
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:46,400
interfaces

1707
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,600
it it looked to me as though you had uh

1708
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,599
two

1709
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:54,560
uh two 10 gig interfaces here

1710
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,560
and um

1711
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,480
probably the same thing here right and

1712
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:04,159
then um uh

1713
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,000
and then and then when the results come

1714
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:09,280
out uh

1715
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:12,560
we we must be looking at um

1716
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,559
i mean so so

1717
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,960
two

1718
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,440
two 10 gig interfaces would be would be

1719
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,640
here

1720
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,120
if we we must be looking at um

1721
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:28,880
uh you know the aggregate of

1722
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:33,280
bi-directional results here right

1723
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,280
yes uh yeah

1724
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:42,480
yeah so i uh i think uh actually

1725
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:45,920
so in the hackathon our just one of our

1726
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:48,959
team members just testing for that but

1727
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,760
uh yeah i i also so looking some some

1728
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:53,280
weird

1729
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,000
when i see that scrap but just we

1730
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:56,320
can say that yeah so we're using t-rex

1731
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,199
and

1732
01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:00,080
we're sending the traffic until the 40

1733
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,519
gigabit

1734
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:06,880
uh bps so and then they came to

1735
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,760
the results for that so uh uh actually

1736
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,800
we need to

1737
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:14,080
uh some delete check about this

1738
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:15,040
result and as you said we also can check

1739
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:17,679
about

1740
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,280
our hardware or specification or data

1741
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,000
port specification

1742
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,800
or the difference between the previous

1743
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,080
hackathon

1744
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,520
and then this hackathon

1745
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,280
yeah yeah good idea all right

1746
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,640
any other any other questions on the

1747
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,440
talk or the

1748
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,440
or the draft

1749
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,440
okay so so it sounds like

1750
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,599
i mean it sounds like you've still got

1751
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:49,440
some development to do here and

1752
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,280
and um uh but it's it's interesting work

1753
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,280
and um you know anytime you put test

1754
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,239
results up you're gonna get

1755
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:57,759
uh some interesting comments back so i

1756
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:00,000
encourage you to keep uh

1757
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:01,520
keep working on it and and then um you

1758
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,080
know uh

1759
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,520
in in our uh in our future meetings

1760
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:10,480
we'll uh

1761
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:13,760
perhaps look into adopting this uh kj

1762
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:13,759
okay thank you

1763
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,080
good thank you

1764
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:23,839
all right

1765
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:31,679
so um so next up up is the uh

1766
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:34,639
discussion of uh future prospects for

1767
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,440
three drafts uh the multiple loss ratio

1768
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,640
search

1769
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:41,759
uh the probabilistic loss ratio search

1770
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:45,120
uh and the network function service

1771
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:51,840
density uh draft

1772
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,840
and um maciac are you with us

1773
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:05,839
oh no

1774
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:14,718
well i don't see maciac

1775
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,719
um well uh let's

1776
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,440
he did he did send uh he did send us a

1777
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:22,340
message to the list today

1778
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,839
um and um

1779
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,600
[Music]

1780
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,600
one of the key one of the key things

1781
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,719
that masiak was raising

1782
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,679
uh had to do with uh the multiple loss

1783
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:33,790
ratio

1784
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,239
search draft

1785
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:38,880
[Music]

1786
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,239
which veraco pollock and maciac have

1787
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,760
written together

1788
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:45,678
and um masiak was

1789
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,280
was under the impression that two

1790
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,560
meetings ago we

1791
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:52,960
we adopted this draft as a working group

1792
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:52,960
draft

1793
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,320
but i don't think i mean i don't think

1794
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,280
that was ever ratified on the mailing

1795
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,960
list

1796
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:03,199
and it doesn't show up in the meeting

1797
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:07,040
minutes according to uh

1798
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:10,638
massie x uh message to the

1799
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:14,800
to the list today so um

1800
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:18,400
uh in in you know in general

1801
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:21,600
this is a this is a draft that that

1802
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:24,879
is designed to search for um

1803
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,080
not just the zero loss ratio uh but

1804
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,280
other uh levels of loss ratio

1805
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,320
all in a combined uh search algorithm uh

1806
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,320
which is

1807
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,000
um you know which is pretty efficient if

1808
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,040
you um

1809
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,560
if you uh if you know if that's the kind

1810
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:42,719
of thing you want to do

1811
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,639
and and um it's also very

1812
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,120
straightforward you know it's a

1813
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:48,239
it's a very fast search algorithm they

1814
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:51,199
use it in the

1815
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,839
uh the fdio uh open source project and

1816
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:55,599
the

1817
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:58,320
uh their uh systems integration test

1818
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,320
so um

1819
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:06,239
has has anybody uh has anybody read this

1820
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:11,519
draft and and would anybody like to show

1821
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:15,519
uh uh sort of some interest in it

1822
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:15,520
especially interest to review it

1823
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,120
oh uh yes uh gabor please

1824
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:32,719
can you hear me yes so i didn't have

1825
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,199
time to read it i just

1826
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:36,239
did a quick look in it and i think it's

1827
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:37,919
interesting

1828
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:39,678
i would like to to read it and and

1829
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,159
comment it and

1830
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,800
i would i wanted to ask the authors if

1831
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:46,239
they have

1832
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:48,719
made a comparison uh in efficiency

1833
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,440
between this search algorithm and the

1834
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,239
traditional

1835
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,879
binary search have you do you know about

1836
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:55,360
it it has

1837
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,199
happened so they compared their

1838
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:02,639
performance

1839
01:22:57,199 --> 01:23:02,638
uh yes i think i i think they have

1840
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:07,519
and the um uh the results are the

1841
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,400
results are

1842
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,600
are are you know basically the kind of

1843
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,120
thing where

1844
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:16,960
um you would have to conduct uh multiple

1845
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:20,239
binary searches

1846
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,440
uh for each different level of loss

1847
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:24,159
ratio

1848
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,440
uh and and because this uh you know

1849
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:28,799
because this searching is

1850
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:31,519
is pretty much going on in parallel um

1851
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,320
uh the multiple loss ratio searches uh

1852
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,520
is

1853
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:39,280
is generally quicker

1854
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:43,040
good so i myself interested in rfc

1855
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:46,800
2544 compliant zero loss search

1856
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:50,280
and unfortunately i have to

1857
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:53,600
perform it many times uh to comply with

1858
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:56,400
rsc8219 and it requires a lot of time

1859
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,639
so if if there would be a better

1860
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:01,199
algorithm which supports zero research

1861
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,239
but just better just faster than binary

1862
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:05,599
search i would you

1863
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:05,599
would be happy to use it

1864
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,639
yeah that that i can't answer directly

1865
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,639
but um

1866
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:15,840
there is a chance that this um uh that

1867
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,599
this might be faster than straight

1868
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,520
binary search as well

1869
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:21,760
i i think the i think the very first

1870
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:25,280
step is to kind of take a jump

1871
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:27,679
from the maximum level uh down to the

1872
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:28,639
uh whatever the received throughput is

1873
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,679
and then uh

1874
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:33,120
search around there so they

1875
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,960
they kind of they kind of make a big

1876
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:38,400
step big step right

1877
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,400
right at the right at the start

1878
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:46,320
okay i will test it with my sait perf

1879
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:49,199
very good very good um

1880
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,960
while you're doing that uh gabor uh i'll

1881
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:54,159
put in a plug for the

1882
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:56,320
binary search with loss verification uh

1883
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:59,839
which you can find in um

1884
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:03,519
uh etsy uh test009

1885
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:05,120
it's a um it's designed to test in the

1886
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,040
uh you know in the virtualized

1887
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:08,639
environment where we can't get rid of

1888
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,719
the transients that uh

1889
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,719
uh you know that we have to live with

1890
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:16,719
but uh but those transients don't

1891
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:20,000
really uh they don't really influence

1892
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,400
um the true resource limitations they're

1893
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,560
just

1894
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,559
you know big interrupts that happen once

1895
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,920
in a while and they follow up the

1896
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,159
binary search because of it so um uh

1897
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,920
i i i'm not sure if i've provided that

1898
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,759
reference to you but uh if you if you

1899
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:38,480
send me an email i'll i'll uh

1900
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:40,000
i'll do that okay thank you

1901
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,159
all right so you're and so you're

1902
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:47,440
willing to uh review this

1903
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:49,759
um are there are there are there any um

1904
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,599
uh i i've already reviewed it and and i

1905
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:54,880
will probably do that again

1906
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,639
um are there any objections in the

1907
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,320
meeting to

1908
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,880
asking for working group adoption of

1909
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,880
this draft

1910
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,719
okay hearing none um then i think we

1911
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:14,560
will

1912
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,560
go ahead and and do that

1913
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:21,520
so we're uh so we're looking at uh

1914
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,760
we're looking at a working group

1915
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:26,800
adoption for um

1916
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:29,040
ml re mlr search uh

1917
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,040
zero zero three it it would probably be

1918
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:34,400
a good idea if um

1919
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,960
if maciac and racco uh uh brought it out

1920
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:39,599
of the expired state

1921
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,400
before we do that but uh but we won't

1922
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:44,800
stand on

1923
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:47,920
uh on circumstances here

1924
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,679
all right so i think

1925
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:51,040
the the other two we're going to have to

1926
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:54,639
let go

1927
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:57,920
um unless monsieur is with us now

1928
01:26:54,639 --> 01:27:02,480
um the

1929
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:04,400
the probabilistic search is uh

1930
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,000
a lot more complicated let's put it that

1931
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,199
way and

1932
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:13,120
um uh as opposed to a

1933
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:15,919
deterministic uh system of search uh

1934
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:16,960
there's a i mean there's an attempt to

1935
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,520
um

1936
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,239
define the you know find this critical

1937
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,679
load

1938
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:26,879
uh satisfying a target loss ratio uh

1939
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:29,840
it makes assumptions which uh are often

1940
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,239
unrealistic for some systems and there's

1941
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,280
a

1942
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:36,718
and there's a tie-in uh to tcp

1943
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:39,840
good put here um

1944
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,440
it's a i mean that when i've looked this

1945
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,199
over i've kind of felt that it was a

1946
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:47,040
little bit experimental

1947
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:51,440
uh i i i was sort of looking for the

1948
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:53,280
uh the uh

1949
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,719
you know some sort of verification that

1950
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,719
that what's being

1951
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:58,800
uh what's being promised is actually

1952
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:02,159
being delivered and that the

1953
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,320
additional detail is is valuable um

1954
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:06,080
and i'm sure i'm sure vrecko has some of

1955
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:09,920
those things in his mind

1956
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:14,559
but um uh we're

1957
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:18,080
at this stage i i'm um

1958
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:21,120
i'm still looking for more uh

1959
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:25,440
with with that quick uh introduction or

1960
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:25,440
or reminder about this draft any other

1961
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:31,920
comments

1962
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:34,880
okay so we'll we'll take this uh uh

1963
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,080
discussion topic to the list as well as

1964
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,480
um

1965
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:40,480
uh the network function service density

1966
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:44,320
uh topic that the

1967
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:44,799
mossiac uh raised i mean basically he's

1968
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,120
uh

1969
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,239
he's talking about many network function

1970
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,960
services

1971
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:52,959
on the the common um

1972
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:58,320
what does cots stand for it's you know

1973
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,520
it's a general purpose computing

1974
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,639
platform

1975
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:04,080
and and um uh

1976
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,719
you know he's got these got these

1977
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,719
different uh

1978
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,080
different uh diagrams here where where

1979
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,320
the uh

1980
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:15,519
vnf's or the network functions are

1981
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:18,000
either connected

1982
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,760
uh through the the v switch or the v

1983
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,560
router or they have uh

1984
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,159
like a memory interface that uh helps

1985
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:28,480
them speed up their

1986
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:32,559
uh their inner connectivity

1987
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:33,440
and um you know lots of considerations

1988
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,760
to take uh

1989
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:40,400
to take care of this but um uh man

1990
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,520
many of the many of the problems are are

1991
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,239
basically

1992
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:46,960
uh you know right right right here in

1993
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:50,718
the virtualization technology and the

1994
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:52,800
uh the the many many choices that you

1995
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:56,080
have when you when this is a

1996
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,840
a cloud network function and the

1997
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,199
cloud networking plugins that are

1998
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,920
possible

1999
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,919
so um

2000
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:07,839
again i think this is one we're gonna

2001
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:07,840
have to take to the list

2002
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:21,840
any any comments on on this particular

2003
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:21,840
this particular draft

2004
01:30:24,239 --> 01:30:29,519
okay well then um

2005
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:34,400
then we're on to our final topic here

2006
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:38,000
which is uh it's a

2007
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:40,960
uh it's a a quick talk here by um

2008
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,320
uh gabor lentz uh from budapest

2009
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,840
university

2010
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,480
and um you know i'm again reminded here

2011
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,360
uh

2012
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:53,678
gabor that uh back in um

2013
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:56,159
back at the uh at the at the beginning

2014
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,320
of march my very last international trip

2015
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:02,000
i was in budapest i really should have

2016
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:04,239
looked you up

2017
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
uh and i'm i'm sorry for missing that

2018
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:09,440
opportunity but uh

2019
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,080
uh in any case um uh you know welcome to

2020
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,799
uh

2021
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,360
welcome to bmg again uh you you helped

2022
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,639
um

2023
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:18,400
marius uh jurgescu uh with his work uh

2024
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:22,320
some time ago

2025
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,920
on the uh the ipv4 or ipv6 uh

2026
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,719
benchmarking topic

2027
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,280
and um it's good to have you back and

2028
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,719
please go ahead with your talk

2029
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,199
thank you very much for your world bank

2030
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:35,520
on uh could you switch on the next slide

2031
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:35,519
please

2032
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:43,599
thank you so this

2033
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:46,559
rfc in which i participated in a little

2034
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,360
extent it was written mainly by marius

2035
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,920
and it

2036
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:52,400
covered the benchmarking methodology for

2037
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:55,920
ipv version 6 transition technologies

2038
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:59,360
it had to be written because rfc

2039
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:02,320
5180 excluded them from its scope

2040
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:03,839
so marius has divided these technologies

2041
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:05,920
into different categories

2042
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,880
and one of them was a single translation

2043
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,120
category

2044
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:13,920
and siit perth addresses this category

2045
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:15,120
in which case uh one of the ports of the

2046
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:17,679
tester end of the dude

2047
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:19,360
this is test is ib version six and the

2048
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,760
other is ipv version four

2049
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,519
and there's a translation between the

2050
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,719
two in the device under test and the

2051
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,000
tester has to test

2052
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:30,480
such kind of devices situ is

2053
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,199
one of the one representation of of this

2054
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:35,199
group

2055
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:38,239
of course site stateless n864

2056
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,879
however there is also state 49864 which

2057
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:42,159
is not

2058
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:45,520
in the scope of ssid perv yet

2059
01:32:42,159 --> 01:32:48,960
so this little uh

2060
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:52,000
tester supports some uh traditional

2061
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:55,760
tests like throughput and frame roslate

2062
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:58,639
these are the same as in rfc 2544

2063
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:00,480
and some tests are different for example

2064
01:32:58,639 --> 01:33:04,080
latency has been redefined

2065
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:07,678
in 8219 it requires to send at least

2066
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,000
500 frames marked and their timestamps

2067
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,320
were

2068
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,040
at least 500 frames instead of only a

2069
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:14,400
single one

2070
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:16,560
like in rfc 254 2544

2071
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,759
and it is it's also included packet

2072
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,760
delay variation

2073
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,880
it is a new test compared to the

2074
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,400
traditional

2075
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:25,280
benchmarking rfcs so my tester supports

2076
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,360
these tests

2077
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:28,880
it doesn't support yet back-to-back

2078
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:31,440
frames because of

2079
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,239
performance issues but i'm thinking of

2080
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:35,280
including

2081
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:38,400
also that later on

2082
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:41,920
so some uh general features

2083
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,320
uh rfc 2544 requires to be able to test

2084
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,840
with

2085
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:49,199
a single uh ip address pair or

2086
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:52,239
25 256 destination networks

2087
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:53,919
uh my site perf supports a number

2088
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:56,559
between the two

2089
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,280
and it also supports uh fixed port

2090
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:00,000
numbers

2091
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:01,920
i mean that the fixed frames and the

2092
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,600
same test frames are sent

2093
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:09,040
out and rst 48

2094
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:11,120
14 which was uh recommended by ul

2095
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:12,320
that i should support that and i

2096
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,480
implemented that

2097
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,080
and i also implemented that i use

2098
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:18,638
increasing or decreasing port numbers

2099
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:22,080
because it's not very easy

2100
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:24,560
and of course besides a stateless n864

2101
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,480
you can use it for testing a pure ipv

2102
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:33,840
version for wiper version 6

2103
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:33,839
routing could you go to the next slide

2104
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:38,320
just a very little about implementation

2105
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:41,760
it is important because

2106
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:45,119
i wanted sid perth to be flexible

2107
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:48,159
and high performance to support both

2108
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:49,119
it was possible that i use simple

2109
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:52,159
binaries

2110
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:53,360
for uh the different measurements and a

2111
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:56,239
bachelor script

2112
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:57,119
which executes the binaries for example

2113
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,519
if

2114
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:01,360
i would like to use throughput testing

2115
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,480
there's a tester for throughput

2116
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:06,880
which is also used for

2117
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,000
packet loss rate testing and a different

2118
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,520
binary is used

2119
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,719
a different transcript is used for

2120
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:17,360
throughput and frame loss rate

2121
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:19,520
testing just if you want to test

2122
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,559
throughput you implement a binary search

2123
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:23,520
and if you want to uh do some frameworks

2124
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:27,199
retesting then

2125
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:29,679
you just test a different frame rates

2126
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:32,239
and as you see in the slides uh it was

2127
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:35,199
written in dpdk the binary

2128
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:36,080
and it is also flexible in the way that

2129
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:38,719
it has some

2130
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,600
different input possibilities some

2131
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:41,600
parameters which

2132
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,520
do not change using a consecutive

2133
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,159
executions they are put in

2134
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,440
uh the configuration file and others are

2135
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,360
put in command line

2136
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,280
so that they can be easily changed from

2137
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:54,839
the bash script

2138
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:57,840
could you please go to the next slide

2139
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,840
please

2140
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:02,480
and there's some some results uh so the

2141
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,040
new feature is

2142
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,839
uh random port numbers so i compare its

2143
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,920
performance

2144
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,880
uh with the original one with those end

2145
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,960
up on numbers

2146
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,639
and it seems that its performance didn't

2147
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:15,600
really it didn't really decrease

2148
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,560
due to this random port numbers so i

2149
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,280
have to rewrite

2150
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,920
the test frames uh just before sending

2151
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,119
but

2152
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,000
and of course i have to generate two

2153
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:27,360
random numbers per

2154
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,560
frame uh i use a mersenne twister

2155
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:31,759
64-bit magentister and it's still remain

2156
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,960
very fast

2157
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:38,159
so i think it it's a good performance

2158
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,719
so i tested ipv version

2159
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:41,599
for kernel routing this was enough for

2160
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:44,560
that

2161
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,600
so i think for for some sat

2162
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,800
implementations

2163
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:52,159
it's more than enough so i just

2164
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:54,000
want to offer it for the list members

2165
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:55,519
so if you are interested in such kind of

2166
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:58,960
testings even if

2167
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,800
you won't just test a simple kernel

2168
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,560
routing or anything else

2169
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:04,960
you can just freely download it and use

2170
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:07,600
it and i would be happy to hear

2171
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,119
if you like it if you require some new

2172
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:11,920
features

2173
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:15,519
i would i would be happy to improve it

2174
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,520
and yes please go to the next slide

2175
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,320
so there are some some papers about it

2176
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,480
the first has already been approved

2177
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,599
and the second one is under review so

2178
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:26,559
they are

2179
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,360
to describe how it works and of course

2180
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,280
there's a link

2181
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:33,599
for the github uh storage this is a

2182
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,480

well uh uh thanks for sharing it with us

2191
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,080

01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:16,239
that uh

2193
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:18,960
that struck me here is this uh you know

2194
01:38:16,239 --> 01:38:21,759
the obviously the random port numbers

2195
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,360
uh as you say it has an impact is is

2196
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,760
this one of the things you plan to write

2197
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:27,440
about

2198
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,440
in your um in your draft

2199
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:32,080
uh not really it's it's something some

2200
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,520
different things but i didn't have time

2201
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:36,960
to update the deaf story

2202
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:39,040
i will do it for the next atf

2203
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:40,239
right right that's what i mean in other

2204
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,080
words uh

2205
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:44,159
some of your some of your measurement

2206
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,080
experience is

2207
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:48,799
what you can bring to bear on the on

2208
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:53,040
future versions of the draft right

2209

2214
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:06,239
um that will influence the uh the draft

in the future

2216
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:12,480

admit that i didn't have time to think

2218
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:18,000
about the draft but i will do it

2219
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:20,560
in two months okay

2220
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,239
okay good good yeah i'm sure i'm sure

2222
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:27,759
if other people

2223
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:30,320
um if other people pick up the

2224
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:31,119
uh pick up your tool and give it a try

2225
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:35,759
you know your

2226
01:39:31,119 --> 01:39:35,759
utility um then um

uh then maybe you know we'll all learn

2228
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,840
something more together that would be

2229
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,000
