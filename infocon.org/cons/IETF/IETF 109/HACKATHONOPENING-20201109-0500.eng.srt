1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,559
first of all i guess while

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,920
people are uh joining i want to uh to

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
thank all of you

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,040
i'm sure this is not a convenient time

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,640
for

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,560
for many of you so i appreciate you

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
uh taking the time whether this is your

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,038
sunday evening or

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,039
early or monday morning or or uh

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
you know maybe it's a little later in

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,960
your day on monday

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,559
which would be nice but um

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,120
perhaps a bit of good news i i don't

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,680
expect this to take the uh the full

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,599
i believe we're scheduled for two hours

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,640
um certainly the material that i'm going

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,000
to present will will not take that long

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,000
and um it's really uh

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
you know depends on questions that come

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,039
up and that type of thing but

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,160
i imagine maybe a half hour to an hour

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,000
is is really what we should expect

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,319
but we'll make use of as much time as we

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,320
need

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
including getting i'm just going to give

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
people a few minutes i sent out an email

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,839
because i know for some people they were

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,439
having problems accessing and

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,439
maybe hadn't registered and

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:26,640
so we're just going to give it a couple

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,560
more minutes

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,320
and hopefully this this view of the

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,280
slides is um

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,279
easy enough to read

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,079
if if i try going into presentation mode

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,199
then it's hard for me to monitor what

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,158
else is going on

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,720
so i think i'll probably just show the

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
slides

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,920
in in this format

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,600
also my if you wanted to

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
you can download uh the slides they are

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
in the meeting materials

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,680
uh i'll warn you the uh it's quite large

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
it's

46
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,440
like 20 something uh

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,840
megabytes it uh there's some images

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
especially gather images multiple of

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
those showing different aspects of it

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,239
so it got a little large and i didn't

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
take time to try to optimize it

52
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,840
but hopefully you have decent bandwidth

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
and can download that

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
and if you have a question at some point

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,879
in time

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,239
um you can um

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,120
uh you know put yourself in in the queue

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
or you can put it in the chat but maybe

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
i think since there won't be that many

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,920
of us

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,239
um you could probably

62
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,238
um

63
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,879
uh you could probably just go ahead and

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,920
uh

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,920
you know start your audio and and

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,359
interject with your question i think if

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,799
that gets unwieldy

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,440
we'll go to a more formal format but uh

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,840
but i expect that should work so we

70
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
could just go ahead and give that a try

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,599
and person thanks for the the

72
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,560
comment about keynote i'll give that a

73
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,839
try

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,720
and probably not right now

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,000
but because i haven't used i don't know

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,280
if i have keynote installed right now

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,599
but maybe i'll play around with that

78
00:03:43,280 --> 00:04:01,840
before the closing

79
00:03:45,599 --> 00:04:01,839
that could be handy

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,480
yeah i could i could show it as a pdf in

81
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
fact

82
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,238
that may be a good thing to do although

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,200
i don't think it'd be too much bigger

84
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,840
than

85
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,839
than this

86
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,040
and the version that's in the media

87
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,799
materials is actually the pdf

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
i was just going to do it in

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,400
presentation mode and then realized

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
that that wouldn't work so well

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
okay i think i'm going to go ahead and

92
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,120
get started

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,800
and again thanks to everyone for for

94
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
joining this is the

95
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,320
the start of the hackathon it's uh it's

96
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,800
different than most of the hackathons

97
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
we've done

98
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,720
it's our second time going through and

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
doing it as a

100
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,919
an online only hackathon

101
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
and really not not by choice that's just

102
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,120
uh

103
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,520
because the meeting is online and and so

104
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
this is the only way we can get together

105
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,039
we've always supported and welcomed

106
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
people to join remotely

107
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,840
uh anyway so we had some of the

108
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
mechanisms in place that we needed for

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,520
that

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
but you know there's some challenges

111
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
with with everyone being remote

112
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,719
and to try to help with that we have

113
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
some new tools

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
i'll probably spend a bit of time going

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,520
over that

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
um and then just going over the format

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
of the hackathon

118
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,160
in general since it's still a relatively

119
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,479
new thing for us to

120
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,240
to meet online like this and we're

121
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:39,840
trying some new things this time around

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,840
to hopefully make it better for everyone

123
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,080
so this is what uh for those of you who

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,840
haven't been to an in-person hackathon

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
this is a little bit of what you could

126
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,560
expect it

127
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,759
in that type of venue um

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,400
so you know this was in prague i believe

129
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,479
one of our our larger hackathons and uh

130
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,479
so you're missing out on obviously a lot

131
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,960
of good camaraderie

132
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,000
and being able to sit right with the

133
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,719
people who you're working

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
with um although for those of you who

135
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,440
are improv

136
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639
you may remember that it got quite

137
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,880
crowded

138
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,400
and hard to move around so maybe there

139
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
are some benefits to us

140
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,000
to us being online you can certainly

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
arrange your own space

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,720
and time a little bit better in that

143
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,719
regard so uh so pluses and minuses

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,400
uh the one thing that hasn't changed

145
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,318
though is is why we're here

146
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,919
we're still here for for the same

147
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,800
reasons and

148
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,440
really it's uh you know common goals

149
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
here

150
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,600
and two-fold one is to just advance the

151
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,919
pace and relevance of ietf standards

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
i think we all believe in the ietf and

153
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,919
the work we do

154
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,840
here it's important work and the ietf

155
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,599
has a long tradition of

156
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,359
uh standards uh but it's also become

157
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
more of a challenge especially

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
uh with the way we've seen the pace of

159
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,840
industry move

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,599
and uh with what's happening in the open

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
source communities there's

162
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,759
there's a lot of pressure to innovate

163
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,359
more quickly and so we want to make sure

164
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,520
that the ietf keeps up

165
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
with that pace that really the standards

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
we provide are not only

167
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,559
really really solid but that they you

168
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
know they

169
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
they complete that we complete them in a

170
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,599
timely fashion

171
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,680
and that we deliver them in a format

172
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
that's easy for people to use

173
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
and so you know to be able to flush out

174
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
ideas while you're working on the drafts

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,919
to write some code

176
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,318
that can back that up and to even have

177
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,840
some code that other people can use

178
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,759
to help them with implementing

179
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,359
understanding adding support for the

180
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,039
draft

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,400
you know those are great things too so

182
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,120
to have those things happening in

183
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
parallel

184
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,759
actually writing the draft is something

185
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
we're really trying to do

186
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
the other main thing we want to try to

187
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,440
do is to attract new people and

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,479
especially developers into the ietf

189
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,479
to help us with this effort not everyone

190
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,800
who's in the ietf is a developer

191
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,479
not everyone who's at the hackathon

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,440
needs to be a developer

193
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
michael you pointed out some great

194
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
examples

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
of that in in the the draft that was

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
written to capture

197
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
kind of how the hackathon works um we

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,680
need people who are knowledgeable in the

199
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,198
area and that you can contribute to the

200
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
hackathon with your

201
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
your knowledge of an area in which

202
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240
you're working on a standard

203
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,599
um or with writing code both are very

204
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
valuable and one of the great things

205
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,640
about the hackathon

206
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,240
is that it brings those people together

207
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
and helps them

208
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,320
provide the venue for them to work

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,799
together whether they're sitting side by

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
side

211
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,000
or you know they're on a kind of a

212
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
conference call with each other as the

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
case may be for this one

214
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,320
but we really want to bring those people

215
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,319
together and have them work with each

216
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,200
other now with everything within the

217
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
ietf that's under the note well

218
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,560
the hackathon is under the notewell as

219
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,720
well

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,000
if you're new to the ietf first of all

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
welcome but

222
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
second of all make yourself familiar

223
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,000
with the notewell i'm not going to go

224
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,240
through

225
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,680
all the details of it but it just it

226
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,839
describes the uh

227
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,000
what you're agreeing to in terms of when

228
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,080
you participate in the ietf the rules

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,120
you're agreeing to

230
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
and uh and so be sure to take a look at

231
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
that

232
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,560
i flashed it up here on the screen but i

233
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,880
i really recommend you go take a look

234
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,279
uh maybe after this to familiarize

235
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,959
yourself with it

236
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,279
what i do want to spend a little bit

237
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,079
more time on is talking about the code

238
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,519
that you're working

239
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,959
on now that code is not an ietf

240
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,160
contribution

241
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,760
um it's really the rules around the code

242
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,079
are whatever

243
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,000
the rules are that first of all your

244
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,399
ability to work on the code

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,399
um you might need to get some permission

246
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,160
from from your employer or whatever

247
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,519
organization you're a part of

248
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,439
but then really you need to look at the

249
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,600
license in the code because

250
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
that tells you your ability to use to

251
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
contribute to the code and how to do it

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
so for each project that's how it's

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,480
determined

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,120
so that's with respect to the code of

255
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,880
course presentations discussions

256
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
when we do our final presentations at

257
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,320
the end of the hackathon

258
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,079
those are our ietf contributions and

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
fall under the notewell as everything

260
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,160
else does

261
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
within the ietf

262
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,560
so uh the hackathon wiki

263
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
if you haven't made yourself familiar

264
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,680
with it yet uh

265
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
certainly recommend that you do that's

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,800
where you're going to find information

267
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,839
about all the projects

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,040
and um how to contact the champions that

269
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
are working on it

270
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,360
on those projects unless i checked we

271
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
had at least 23 projects

272
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,480
i expect a couple more will be added

273
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,000
during this week

274
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
so uh and if you are a champion leading

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
a project

276
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
um you know keep your information up to

277
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,920
date if you find

278
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,160
important pieces of information that you

279
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,160
didn't put there before go back and add

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,510
them in

281
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,199
anyone can

282
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,000
[Music]

283
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
anyone can update the wiki you just need

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,160
a data tracker account

285
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,120
and you must all have that now since

286
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,120
you're on this session

287
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,719
now if you're not sure uh which project

288
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
to join

289
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
one thing you might want to do is check

290
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,200
out the lost and found

291
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,480
now this serves two purposes one

292
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,640
if you've never um uh

293
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
sorry if you're new and you're trying to

294
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,480
figure out which project

295
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
you can just put your skills out there

296
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
and then

297
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
a champion who's like looking for

298
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
someone for their team

299
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
can come and find you the other thing is

300
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,320
a team champion you can proactively

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,079
advertise

302
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
some people that you need or skills that

303
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
you need and

304
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
then when someone who's new and not on a

305
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,199
team comes to this

306
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,560
they can find you so uh

307
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
when i took a screenshot there wasn't

308
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,880
too much information in there yet

309
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,560
but that always is the case at the start

310
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,279
but as people start to add their

311
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,599
information in there it gets more useful

312
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,920
so i encourage you to take a look there

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
and michael i i see your question in the

314
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
chat i'll i'll get to that there's a

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,760
couple slides on the room of networking

316
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,760
so i'll get to that a little later on

317
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,920
okay the agenda we're here at the

318
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,560
kickoff and um

319
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,639
then after this and for really the

320
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,279
entire week it could be through

321
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,680
thursday evening your time or into

322
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,680
friday depending on

323
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,279
the time zone you're in all teams are

324
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,279
free to just kind of figure out their

325
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,480
own schedule which they want to work on

326
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,160
their project

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
with people being in so many different

328
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,839
time zones and having different

329
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,600
availability

330
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,240
um we found that uh based on some

331
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
surveys

332
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
that it seemed a longer period where

333
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,319
people could

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
pick and choose time within the week uh

335
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
to

336
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,439
gather together and work was better than

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,079
like forcing a set

338
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
uh period like long periods of time each

339
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,519
day

340
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,839
so that's up to you not only when you

341
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,000
meet but exactly how you meet

342
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,959
and there's a link here to the team

343
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,560
schedule

344
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,800
so that's where team champions please

345
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,800
you know put when and how you want to

346
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,479
meet and then other people

347
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,719
who want to join your project can meet

348
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,200
that way if you don't have it there

349
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
already

350
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,560
that's no problem you can have some

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,160
discussions with your team

352
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,279
figure out what tools you want to use

353
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,120
you are welcome to use gather uh some of

354
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,480
you got experience with that from the

355
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
last ietf

356
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,760
we have a space set up that i'll show

357
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,720
you a bit about

358
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
if you want to use webex you can request

359
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,160
a webex account so you can set up

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,320
webex meetings if you want to use you

361
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,839
know some other conferencing tool or

362
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
not even use a conferencing tool

363
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,800
whatever you want to use for your team

364
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
that's perfectly fine you could use

365
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,040
slack for example

366
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,240
but it just helps to have the team agree

367
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,120
on the timing and how to meet

368
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,040
and then on friday at the same time as

369
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,480
this kickoff so for some of you again it

370
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,719
could be thursday evening

371
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,199
that's when we'll have our closing and

372
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,440
that's when everyone every team has the

373
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,959
opportunity to present what you did

374
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,760
and um it's a great way to have a

375
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,839
summary

376
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,600
that you can share with everyone but

377
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,160
especially obviously those who aren't

378
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
working

379
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
on your project so they get a better

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,760
idea of what you you did

381
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
and that then they can come to you and

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,399
and meet with you for more

383
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,839
in-depth uh questions and conversations

384
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
around it

385
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,320
okay looking a little bit more at gather

386
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,959
so

387
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
this is kind of a zoomed out view of

388
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,319
gather

389
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,199
showing not the entire space but but a

390
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,560
good chunk of it and you can see

391
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,359
hackathon lounge that's these tables

392
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,518
over here

393
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,680
in gray and that's the space that we

394
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,440
now you can actually use any space here

395
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,160
the whole week

396
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,160
but to just to help us as a critical

397
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,319
mass of people get together we have all

398
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,360
these tables and the thought is that

399
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,279
you can use those tables to uh

400
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,440
you know you can designate one for for

401
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,000
your project and you can use it as a

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,360
space to

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,079
meet if you need more space beyond those

404
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,959
tables

405
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,239
you can really use any table anywhere

406
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
within

407
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,920
this whole space so we don't envision

408
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,000
running out of

409
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
tables but if that does happen it's not

410
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,399
a problem

411
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,360
zooming in a little bit this is more

412
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,519
like the view you would see

413
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,279
when you first enter and if you haven't

414
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,839
tried yet

415
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,720
you will be asked for your data tracker

416
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,160
credentials

417
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,000
so if you've already signed into the

418
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
wiki or something like that it's great

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,440
it uses single sign-on

420
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,279
and you can use that to join gather

421
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
so i just tried it before this meeting

422
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
it's pretty

423
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,519
seamless experience as far as i can tell

424
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,519
hopefully that that works well for you

425
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
and yes oh did i say the left the

426
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
hackathon is to the right you are

427
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,360
correct

428
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,519
if i just go back i don't know if i said

429
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,800
so yeah that is the hackathon the gray

430
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,800
area to the right there

431
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,560
and here it's also to the right

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
so as you go over toward that space to

433
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,959
the right

434
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,479
you can see there's a sign that says

435
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,119
it's kind of small depends on how big

436
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,160
your eyes are

437
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,880
hackathon tables and

438
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,439
if you get up close to that you can

439
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,880
actually

440
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,480
interact with that sign and

441
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,279
you can use it to get access to the team

442
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,440
schedule

443
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,360
to be honest i'm not sure if we were

444
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
trying to get the team schedule embedded

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
within that sign

446
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,640
worst case it's a link and you at least

447
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,319
have the link and you can go to the team

448
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,559
schedule

449
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,240
and what you'll find there then is you

450
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,678
know teams have the ability to say hey

451
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,959
we're meeting at table e

452
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:19,280
or b or wherever and

453
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,880
you can use that table

454
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,839
now when you go over to one of the

455
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,439
tables you can see i'm over here by

456
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,840
table b right now and there's some items

457
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,440
on the table you can interact with

458
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,720
what you see lit up in yellow there

459
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,720
that is a

460
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,120
[Music]

461
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,919
shared document basically that the kodi

462
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,320
md

463
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
that we use for note taking shared note

464
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,320
taking

465
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,320
in the ietf sessions you can interact

466
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,000
with that so you get close to it

467
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,439
you press on the x key as it says down

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
there at the bottom

469
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,320
and then whoever is interacting with it

470
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,480
you can have like a joint

471
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,399
session around it and that should be

472
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,960
persistent and you should be able to use

473
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
it

474
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
so that's one way for your your team to

475
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,639
collaborate

476
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,679
if you want to use that some of the

477
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,799
other tables

478
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,559
have these whiteboards interactions the

479
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,000
same you press the x

480
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,000
and there's a whiteboard the

481
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,880
whiteboard's kind of cool and that

482
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,679
you know it lets you draw shapes and

483
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,679
diagrams and that type of thing

484
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,000
like a regular kind of whiteboard tool

485
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
does so you can decide what's better for

486
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
your team we have a limited number of

487
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
these due to some restrictions as to

488
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,480
what you could actually do in the

489
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,679
gathering environment

490
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,200
so all tables have one or the other so

491
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
just kind of pick the one that works

492
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,799
better for you

493
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
you could of course get greedy and take

494
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,559
two tables and

495
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,760
as long as space permits you could go

496
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,760
for that if you really wanted to

497
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:59,760
and aside from my my brief little

498
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,320
description there's a complete guide for

499
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,280
gather

500
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,039
so the link to it's in the wiki um i

501
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,879
recommend you go take a look

502
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,640
i played around with it a little bit

503
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
seemed pretty intuitive seemed to work

504
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
well

505
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
i didn't even talk about the um you know

506
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
when two people get close to each other

507
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,080
you're entered into a

508
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
um kind of an audio and perhaps video if

509
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
you enabled it conference with each

510
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,559
other

511
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,400
and that's really handy so you could all

512
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,918
sit around a table and interact with

513
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,000
each other that way

514
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,520
so you don't even need to use another

515
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
tool if you want to just use

516
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,559
gather give it a try now one thing i'll

517
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
warn you about

518
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,760
we are limited during the hackathon to

519
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,840
only 50 concurrent users

520
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,840
due to people working at different times

521
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,799
different time zones we think 50 will be

522
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,039
enough

523
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,918
um if it's not we can figure out another

524
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,799
plan

525
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,720
so if you end up trying to join gather

526
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,520
and you get some kind of error message

527
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,760
about

528
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
you know we've already reached capacity

529
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,559
let us know

530
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,880
and we'll see if we can find a solution

531
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,879
for that

532
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,600
okay i'm gonna move on and now to the

533
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
network request

534
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,559
and uh you know i think this is really

535
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
cool this is something that we worked on

536
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,080
thanks to the knock team for the

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
previous hackathon

538
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,678
and it's working just even better for

539
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,440
this one

540
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,799
so uh the idea is that

541
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,360
um you you actually

542
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,039
for many projects you need access to

543
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
share to a shared network

544
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,520
many times we configure like a switch at

545
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,918
a table and then people can

546
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,918
actually plug devices into it there may

547
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
be some special networking requirements

548
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
that they have

549
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,960
uh for example the itf network is

550
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,559
is very uh it's great and that there's

551
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
very few restrictions there's not a lot

552
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,240
of filtering that it does

553
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
so you basically have unfettered uh

554
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,440
internet access

555
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,280
but maybe you actually want something

556
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,080
more than that perhaps

557
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,039
uh somebody like you on an ipv6 only

558
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,039
network or you need prefix delegation or

559
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
something like that so there's various

560
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,080
things you can request

561
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,360
and uh the requirement is you need a

562
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,760
raspberry pi

563
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,120
and there's some different models that

564
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,240
are supported there

565
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,039
i actually have a raspberry pi 2 that's

566
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,039
only has one

567
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,760
network adapter on it and so the

568
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,520
wireless works but i can only connect

569
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,840
wirelessly if i want to connect

570
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,360
another physical device into it i need

571
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,439
to get a

572
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,199
a little adapter like a usb to

573
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
ethernet adapter i haven't actually

574
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
tried that out but i understand that

575
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,440
should work if i acquire one of those so

576
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,959
if you need to plug a device into the

577
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,919
network you can do that

578
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
and each team can kind of your champion

579
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,880
can

580
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,280
request this for your team and you can

581
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
have your own little network space

582
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,799
that's carved out where you can all have

583
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,039
the same capabilities

584
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,039
and share that with each other the way

585
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,039
to request that

586
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
and anything that you need from it is

587
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,760
through this link here

588
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,039
and the doc team will get you set up if

589
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,240
there's something that you want and they

590
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,080
can't provide it well

591
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,240
no harm done they'll let you know that

592
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
too

593
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:27,360
so yes a great question about gather

594
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,840
i think it is helpful to

595
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,120
um close your window when you're not

596
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,600
using it

597
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,439
um but to be honest i don't know

598
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,959
i think the yellow moon mode i don't

599
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,320
know if that keeps you

600
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,200
active as a user

601
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,200
i would say to play it safe and to free

602
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,640
up resources for other people

603
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,320
if you're going to be gone for an

604
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,360
extended period of time i would just

605
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,039
probably you know exit the space or

606
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,600
close the window

607
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,039
um but i don't know for sure so we'll

608
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,840
have to look at the guide and

609
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,000
and see uh exactly how that works i

610
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,760
didn't look into it in that detail

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,840
so it's a great question sorry i don't

612
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
have that answer

613
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,080
okay i'm gonna move on

614
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,480
so the project presentations i mentioned

615
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,760
those these presentations will be

616
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,840
um at the closing so

617
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,879
this will be friday or thursday evening

618
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,840
for you depending on

619
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,600
on where you're at uh it's optional but

620
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,639
i highly recommend that

621
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
you do it and the reason is a couple

622
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,640
different things

623
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,879
one is it kind of forces you to

624
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,200
summarize what you did which i think

625
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,240
even you'll find helpful but certainly

626
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,559
the rest of your team it's a good way to

627
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
uh you know have a short summary that

628
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,639
you can give to anyone to show

629
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
what you did and explain to them that

630
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
the benefits of it or the impact it

631
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,080
should have on the internet draft that

632
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,200
you're working on or that they're

633
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,760
working on

634
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,279
so it's really helpful and then to be

635
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,400
able to present that

636
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,520
live at the closing is a great thing but

637
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,880
then we'll record it

638
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,600
and other people can look at the

639
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,520
recording and download your presentation

640
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,439
and that's really handy so um

641
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,039
you know depending on how many we have

642
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,960
that's how we figure out

643
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,400
how many minutes each presentation will

644
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,880
be last time

645
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
we set a five minute maximum so that we

646
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,240
just don't keep people here

647
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
all night and we'll probably do the same

648
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
thing with the number of projects we

649
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,400
have

650
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,480
and the number of presentations i

651
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,960
anticipate we're going to have

652
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,880
um i think five minutes will be okay if

653
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,880
we have somewhere between 10 to 20

654
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,559
presentations we should be able to get

655
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,559
through them all without any problem

656
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,399
and the way you'll present is actually

657
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
just right here in me techo

658
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,600
you'll be presenting your slides just

659
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,480
like i am

660
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,918
so you'll want to go ahead and and

661
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,960
familiarize yourself with

662
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,960
with that aspect of me tech a little bit

663
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
now what we do in order to share the

664
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,400
presentations with with everyone and to

665
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,400
make it easy for everyone to access them

666
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,400
during the closing session

667
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,559
is we have um we load them up we upload

668
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:32,400
them into github and

669
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,678
there is an ietf hackathon github org

670
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,720
that's been created and within it there

671
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:42,640
is a

672
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,720
repo for this hackathon for ietf109

673
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,559
and you can see it's labeled project

674
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
presentations that's because the idea is

675
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,279
that's what's going to have all of our

676
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,960
presentations

677
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,600
that we share at the end of the

678
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,600
hackathon this isn't for your code

679
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,520
you can also put code here and if you

680
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,399
need a place to

681
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,679
you can see the mdns responder repos

682
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,440
down there

683
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,279
that was one of the hackathon projects

684
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,919
that continues to be worked on

685
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,039
if you need a place to house your code

686
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,039
you can use this

687
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,559
as well and if you need to get set up

688
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,000
with that or need any help with that you

689
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,559
can reach out to me and i'll help you

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,240
out

691
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,559
but we also use it to upload our

692
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,320
presentations and if you already have

693
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,240
another home for your the code you're

694
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,439
working on that's perfectly fine

695
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,000
this is just here as a convenience

696
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,279
so if you go into uh that repo and you

697
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
look at the readme

698
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
it has the instructions and you can see

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,480
um

700
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,480
we've gone on when you upload it upload

701
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,840
it into pdf just to make it easy for

702
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,360
people to use them and

703
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,080
it might even help you when it comes

704
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,199
time to present it

705
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,960
you do need to be a member of the ietf

706
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,240
hackathon github org

707
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,960
in order to be able to upload things

708
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,559
and then you'll have access to this repo

709
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,840
and other repos

710
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,158
so if you want to get um

711
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,199
added as a member you can see the

712
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,960
instructions here

713
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,760
you just send me your github um

714
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,480
uh id your your uh now it's important

715
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,158
for us to be because github ids end up

716
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,520
all looking the same and being kind of

717
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,960
convoluted

718
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,799
because it's a shared name space so

719
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,559
i think it's a really really helpful

720
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,679
practice if you put the name by which

721
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,080
you're known

722
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,080
uh there enable two-factor

723
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,279
authentication so we make sure no one

724
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,439
hacks your account

725
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,039
and does bad things because we give you

726
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,760
pretty broad permissions

727
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,200
so do those things first and then send

728
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,640
me your github username

729
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,120
and i'll add you as a member

730
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,159
and don't wait till last minute because

731
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,320
a lot of things pop

732
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
up the last day of the hackathon so just

733
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,918
do that in advance if you already know

734
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,760
or think you're going to want to be

735
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,720
uploading a presentation

736
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,879
there's no harm in being added now so

737
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,840
send it to me and i'll get you added you

738
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
know by tomorrow

739
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,918
okay one other thing you'll find that i

740
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
want to point out that's in that same

741
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,000
repo

742
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,520
is there's a template and this is um i

743
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
guess mainly only helpful

744
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,399
if you're able to work with a powerpoint

745
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,320
template it's in powerpoint format

746
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,879
if that's helpful for you feel free to

747
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,320
use it it's a template that just

748
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,399
um it's formatted a little bit like

749
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,158
the presentation i'm going through now

750
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,840
it it asks you

751
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,520
prompts you for like the questions and

752
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,439
the type of information

753
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,039
that we're looking for for the hackathon

754
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,799
a lot of people find it handy

755
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,200
because it's just a very simple template

756
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,120
that you can put your information into

757
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,799
so it's there for you to use you don't

758
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,639
have to use it

759
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,639
but it's just there for as a help

760
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,679
okay before i forget i want to say a

761
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,799
huge thanks

762
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,159
to uh to both icann and the cisco

763
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,960
and the devnet team uh both of them have

764
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
been huge

765
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,760
um supporters of this and icam is

766
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,840
is the sponsor of this hackathon so

767
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
the the costs are different when you run

768
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,360
a virtual hackathon

769
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,799
but there is is still a cost that's

770
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,360
incurred and uh

771
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,200
we really i think um i can they've been

772
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:28,240
a great supporter of the hackathon

773
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,960
of the last several hackathons so thanks

774
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,159
to both them

775
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,159
and to cisco.net

776
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,120
and with that we are through the

777
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,399
material that i wanted to share with

778
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,320
everyone

779
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,360
and uh so i'll kind of just open up the

780
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,360
floor for questions

781
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,869
[Music]

782
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,080
so it doesn't like it's a question but

783
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,639
was there a little bit of a problem with

784
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,080
the uh the vpn was it not working is it

785
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,760
something that

786
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,840
um uh that you just need to

787
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,399
figure out let's see it was working fine

788
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,639
for me

789
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,199
i have a raspberry pi too i wasn't

790
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:20,000
asking for any special features

791
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:23,200
but i just got the recipe and

792
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,640
you know i had had access into the ietf

793
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
network

794
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,640
and um and it seemed to be working fine

795
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,039
so as far as i know everything's working

796
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,440
if if you're having any difficulty

797
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,000
um contact the the knock team and

798
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,799
they've been pretty great just realize

799
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,640
they might be sleeping now so uh yeah

800
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:51,840
you may need to try

801
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,840
to get a hold of them again tomorrow

802
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:04,960
um any other questions

803
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:07,918
any other

804
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
okay well if no one has any questions

805
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,640
i'm gonna stay on

806
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,679
for a little bit longer um

807
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,200
just in case uh you know like if you

808
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
haven't tried out gather

809
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,120
if you haven't if you want to play

810
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,480
around with that um i'll be here

811
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,879
i'm actually going to try to look into

812
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,679
the guide and and find out what happens

813
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,480
about

814
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,159
this you know a 50 person limit and the

815
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,720
whole yellow moon mode

816
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,039
i didn't know about the yellow moon mode

817
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,000
so i'm going to have to read about that

818
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,200
but um i hope that information was

819
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,320
helpful

820
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,799
um and actually let me do one

821
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,840
other thing while we're still here i'm

822
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,279
going to

823
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,279
stop sharing my screen

824
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,279
and i just realized i wasn't sending

825
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,279
video and

826
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,559
that's really too bad because i forgot

827
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,120
to mention that

828
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,720
i'm wearing this hackathon shirt from

829
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,678
when we actually were physically in

830
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,519
bangkok

831
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,919
which and i'm sure there's a fair number

832
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,799
of you actually have this shirt too

833
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,960
so um uh hopefully we'll get another

834
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,760
chance to go back to thailand and to

835
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,440
bangkok

836
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,919
and uh for this week maybe the best you

837
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
can do

838
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,200
is you know make sure you have some good

839
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,199
thai food that you order or something

840
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,960
it was really a great venue and i'm

841
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,880
sorry we can't be there but

842
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,159
hopefully the the hackathon can still

843
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
work really well

844
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
and uh work well for some people who

845
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,760
wouldn't have been able to

846
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
you know travel and it may actually help

847
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,120
in that regard

848
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:49,120
because now we're all kind of working on

849
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,039
a more equal footing and we have some

850
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,840
good resources like like the networking

851
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:57,840
capability that's there

852
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:11,840
so what i was going to do is

853
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:11,840
try taking a look at the wiki

854
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:27,440
and okay that didn't work so well

855
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:30,559
i see but as soon as i do this

856
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,200
maybe that'll fix it um

857
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,399
so let me show the wiki can you guys see

858
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,840
the wiki

859
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,840
am i showing that okay

860
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,639
okay i'm gonna go back to it again great

861
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,880
thank you um

862
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,279
so you know this is really your your

863
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
source for information i recommend uh

864
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,039
going here of course you can always

865
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,360
uh contact me but i i may be sleeping um

866
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,120
you can send me an email and uh and i'll

867
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,360
try to help out too

868
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,319
or just send an email to the hackathon

869
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,480
list that's probably a great bet

870
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,480
if you haven't subscribed yet here's a

871
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,918
link for how to subscribe

872
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,679
um what i wanted to point out

873
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:23,759
was the the team schedule

874
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,359
and if you go there i see you know a

875
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
number of teams have already put up

876
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,560
their information

877
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,720
so uh take a look at that and again i

878
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,359
expect this to get updated during the

879
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,520
week as schedules get figured out

880
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,918
but i think this will be a a good way

881
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,599
for for teams to meet

882
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:45,520
um and

883
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,440
and try gather i'm going to experiment

884
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,159
with it a bit during the course of the

885
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,159
week

886
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,679
from what i saw it looks like it could

887
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,000
be a really good way

888
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,879
for for teams to meet so i would try

889
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,960
giving it

890
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,799
you know give it a shot i'm not saying

891
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,839
it needs to be the only way you work

892
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,760
together

893
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,799
but it can certainly augment um

894
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,040
you're working together and uh so

895
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,000
i would play around with it and we'll

896
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,000
have that space

897
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,800
up not only for the hackathon but it'll

898
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,520
be up of course for the ietf meeting

899
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,160
so uh get familiar with it it's a good

900
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,480
way to

901
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,279
hopefully replace some of that

902
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,119
interaction

903
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,480
that normally happens when we're

904
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,359
physically together in a

905
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,680
in the same space together so the more

906
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,520
we

907
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,399
we try these things and learn how they

908
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,320
work and what things they don't do well

909
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,680
uh the better we'll be able to you know

910
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
figure out what to do with the next

911
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,040
hackathon the next meeting

912
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,520
because we already know the uh the next

913
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:49,279
ietf meeting will also be virtual so

914
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,280
or online so it'll be good to learn for

915
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
that

916
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,040
yeah i think uh michael i was i'm just

917
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,160
uh going back and looking at some

918
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,560
comments so

919
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,240
you mentioned the the wired access

920
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,680
working it it should

921
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,640
should work um like i said i haven't

922
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,560
tried it yet

923
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,480
but it should be able to get it working

924
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,680
and i think uh you know just check in

925
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,400
with clemens

926
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,960
and if it's not working at the moment or

927
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,440
if there's some restrictions to it

928
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,800
we should be able to figure that out but

929
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,400
uh

930
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,920
but my understanding is depending on

931
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,240
your your device

932
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,200
and you should be able to get to work

933
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,200
with any

934
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:54,319
device actually you just need one of

935
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:57,200
those adapters

936
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,200
service browser

937
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,489
[Music]

938
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,560
uh okay yeah so i don't know i i haven't

939
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,240
figured

940
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,920
out that out for the driver but but

941
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,160
check with clemens because

942
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,160
um

943
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,720
he uh i know he's he had some experience

944
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,880
with it and i thought he started by

945
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,879
testing out with a raspberry pi 2

946
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,480
and because that's what i had and he was

947
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,240
letting me know

948
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,839
about what i would need if i wanted to

949
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,640
get it working so i'm pretty sure it

950
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
works but

951
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,160
there could be some peculiarities or

952
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
limitations to

953
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,799
adapters

954
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,760
i didn't understand the question about

955
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:55,279
service browser on android finds nobody

956
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,280
talk about that it's in video

957
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,320
what was that i'm just gonna talk how

958
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,440
about that

959
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,960
yeah that's that's great so

960
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,200
yeah so my my uh my phone

961
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,000
let me see i'll i'll let me see can you

962
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,720
see this can if i do this does it work

963
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,920
no yeah you can't see yeah i kind of see

964
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,480
it yeah so if i really

965
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,320
you can see i got i got an ip address

966
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,079
you almost can see it yeah

967
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,520
okay anyway um so so i ran a

968
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,280
a multicast uh um

969
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,000
uh discovery and it tells me that

970
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,200
there's nothing there may be because

971
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
there's nobody out there that's

972
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,000
answering

973
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,759
that's why i want to know if anyone else

974
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,839
was on it

975
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,960
and because the protocol that we want to

976
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:46,320
test uses multicast link layer

977
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,320
ipv6 to find each other

978
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,720
so if that doesn't work then then it

979
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,280
doesn't help us right

980
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,640
so are you just on the ietf network or

981
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,839
are you on a special

982
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,520
part of it that was set up for your team

983
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,160
i don't know i don't know what i'm on so

984
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,520
uh that's i guess the question are each

985
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,000
team getting a set like in

986
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,160
if if we were in the room we would all

987
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,640
be on the same network unless we had

988
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,240
made a very very very special

989
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,078
arrangement like even that

990
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,839
when you would have tables or switches

991
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,359
they would still be mostly all on the

992
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,880
same network right

993
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,560
um and we remember discovering that

994
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,040
the connectivity between the wired

995
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,640
network and the wireless network was not

996
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,640
multicast um

997
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,359
clean um at some

998
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,040
meeting or other when we realized we

999
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,078
better plug all our wires into the same

1000
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,599
switch to be

1001
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,359
able to do what we want but we have the

1002
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,480
same address subnet so we all seem to be

1003
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,839
on the same network we just that there

1004
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,400
is multicast filters

1005
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,520
on the wireless not surprising um so

1006
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,640
that's sort of like

1007
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,480
just want to know if if it's going to

1008
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,720
really be like we're all on the same lan

1009
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
and and i guess you're telling me that

1010
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
i'd better make sure that whoever else

1011
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,480
has

1012
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,959
mult has a vpn uh that the knock knows

1013
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,160
they're supposed to be on my corner of

1014
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,720
the network

1015
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,839
i i think i think it depends like uh at

1016
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,799
ffb

1017
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,000
at a normal like at a physical ietf

1018
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,440
hackathon

1019
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,560
we um we had this space where yeah by

1020
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,200
default if you just

1021
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,880
ask for a switch at your table it it

1022
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,520
should just stick you on the ietf

1023
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,599
network

1024
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,800
but you know with just a physical device

1025
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,839
you know connected

1026
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,960
but many people asked for a special

1027
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,520
uh network so they they could handle say

1028
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,800
you know they wanted ipv6 only they

1029
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,560
wanted something special where they

1030
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,760
wanted to be isolated

1031
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,400
and that they wanted a different

1032
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,839
behavior they wanted prefix delegation

1033
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,920
uh you know for for their their subnet

1034
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,920
and we got we got we got prefix

1035
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,880
delegation enabled that was enabled for

1036
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
the whole network by the last time we

1037
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,200
did that

1038
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,880
it wasn't you didn't have to ask for it

1039
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,560
even um

1040
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
i can't do it on my phone so i can't

1041
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,599
test it and i can't do it on my

1042
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,520
device because i don't have wires

1043
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,960
working i i suspect that i just have the

1044
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,800
wrong usb dongle

1045
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,079
um and i've been searching drawers for a

1046
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,640
better one and see if

1047
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,839
it works better but i don't know yet so

1048
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,359
and the other thing i don't know

1049
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,920
i don't know how many people have it but

1050
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,839
but there's no i we at least

1051
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,480
um what's his name i can log into our

1052
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,560
device but i can't um

1053
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,560
clemens can can do it but there's no

1054
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,920
local login so i can't debug anything so

1055
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,440
that's fine

1056
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:36,800
but okay i'm trying to connect to

1057
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,599
the ietf virtual

1058
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,240
um and it's not working for me at the

1059
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,640
moment

1060
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,759
it worked the other day it didn't work

1061
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,520
for them

1062
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,800
it didn't work for me the first time i

1063
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,440
booted

1064
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,280
um it it and i didn't know the password

1065
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,119
which is itf itf

1066
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,319
um yeah because it had to be longer than

1067
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
four apparently

1068
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,359
um so it didn't work at all the first

1069
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,960
day after i

1070
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,960
i power cycled earlier sunday for me

1071
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,839
um it it it worked for a minute or less

1072
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,359
and then it would disconnect um and and

1073
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,560
that happened several times and then

1074
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,680
about an hour ago it just

1075
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,720
started working working perfectly

1076
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,359
so okay i think we'll have to uh

1077
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,480
ping clemens yeah i'm sure i don't know

1078
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,520
what time zone he's in

1079
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,880
i'm guessing west coast but um

1080
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,880
maybe it's europa no he's he's in europe

1081
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,319
he's asleep sometimes somewhere probably

1082
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,040
yeah so i

1083
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,279
oh no i just rebooted my device and it

1084
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,920
looks like it's working

1085
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,599
now too yeah and if you if you if you

1086
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,720
hook up a serial console you can watch

1087
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,920
it boot but you don't get much

1088
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,560
information from it unfortunately

1089
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,079
oh no i'm not connected to that wi-fi

1090
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,359
let me

1091
00:42:52,079 --> 00:43:00,240
i'm now i'm still not able to join

1092
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,880
the ietf network off of my device

1093
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,799
so yes i'm curious how many people

1094
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,160
intend to use the vpn who are

1095
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,839
part of this meeting i'm just curious

1096
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,839
maybe you just put your hand up or

1097
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
something

1098
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,240
oh i'm on now it connected

1099
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,800
the latency is not good like 100

1100
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,800
milliseconds but you know i

1101
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,440
what do i like going across the planet

1102
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,440
several times

1103
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,160
yeah i did a speed test on it of course

1104
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,960
yeah and it should be able to handle

1105
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,880
you know i i don't think load is a

1106
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,079
problem i just think yeah the speed's

1107
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,240
not going to be

1108
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,240
fantastic but um

1109
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,839
uh okay so i have two devices

1110
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,839
on it now

1111
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,000
if i don't know about if if there's

1112
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,799
something special i need to do to get my

1113
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
devices

1114
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:09,359
to answer your

1115
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,280
your multi-class your multicast

1116
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,480
request or if they'll just do that by

1117
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,599
default

1118
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,000
depends on your device phones don't

1119
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,119
always

1120
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,720
say who they are but um so

1121
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,680
you still see no no devices out there

1122
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,319
i don't know i have to look again oh

1123
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,279
yeah no

1124
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:30,800
uh is uh i see home sharing companion

1125
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,680
link atc

1126
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,200
apple mob dev2 you i do have an apple

1127
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,520
device connected

1128
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,960
yeah i have an iphone and i have a

1129
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,880
macbook pro

1130
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,000
well given that i just saw those two

1131
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,920
those things

1132
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:51,440
uh macbook probably and it's

1133
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:53,680
one's an ending in ipv4 2818

1134
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,200
charles is macbook pro that's gotta be

1135
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,839
yours so that means that

1136
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,118
multicast works and service discovery

1137
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,240
and link local

1138
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:07,280
works so that's fine okay

1139
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,279
great so when in doubt reboot

1140
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,440
but yeah so that's great news and it

1141
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,720
also means that we didn't do any special

1142
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,960
thing to be in the same group which

1143
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,319
means that whoever hooks up their vpn

1144
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,599
can probably we can probably all see

1145
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,040
each other until we start knowing each

1146
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,680
other to the point where we have to do

1147
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,279
something

1148
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:33,839
isolated yeah fantastic

1149
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:33,839
yeah that is that is fantastic

1150
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,839
okay anyone else any uh any questions

1151
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,560
otherwise i may actually declare declare

1152
