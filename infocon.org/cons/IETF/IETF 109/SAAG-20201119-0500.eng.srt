so here's the agenda or at least so far

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,839
uh if anybody has any bashing

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
propose please

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
join the queue and we can talk about

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
those

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,399
and i will give a couple of

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
seconds for that especially as i catch

33
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,560
up on the chat window

34
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,840
but i don't see anyone joining the queue

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,759
so let's go ahead

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
and go through to the working group

37
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,960
reports uh

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,839
sorry let's go to the memoriam my

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,960
apologies so

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,320
as you all know and maybe saw at

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,439
the plenary jim shot passed away

42
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,720
in october and it's been a huge loss

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:23,840
to us so let's have

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:23,840
a moment of silence to remember jin

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,519
thank you jim we will miss you

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,519
and uh

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,560
can move on to the working group

48
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
summaries

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
so i think most of these we can just

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
sort of

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,239
uh page through

52
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,120
we've gotten reports from most people

53
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,160
and let's see i've got a local copy up

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
so i can sort of

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,040
sneak ahead um

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,000
so emu just sent one which i do not

57
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,040
believe made it into the

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,599
slides yes but that is available

59
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,319
and if anybody has any additional

60
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,079
comments

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,200
that they want to make about what has

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
been going on in their working group

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
by all mean please join the queue don't

64
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,238
wait for the

65
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,238
particular slide to come up

66
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,440
we've got a good response rate

67
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,359
through the different groups although

68
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,640
there are a handful that did not meet

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,239
and also did not send reports

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,040
uh so it looks like sec dispatch we had

71
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,200
uh this session on monday and we had

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,239
just a couple of

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,079
presentations i don't know if

74
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,640
if anybody does want to come to the mic

75
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,640
and talk about sex dispatch particularly

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,879
uh or for any of the the other related

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,720
work i know

78
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
yeah thank you to the working group

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,680
chairs by the way i mean this is a

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,640
record turnout in terms of having these

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,159
reports before

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,279
sag yeah we

83
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,840
even got one from like uh drip i

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
remember seeing

85
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,960
even open pgp so really much appreciate

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
it it's great to have the status

87
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
kind of during cover times we're all

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
remote just understanding what's

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,560
happening

90
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
yes just to get a reminder of where

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,800
things are

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
even when we can't be together in person

93
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
so

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,039
uh i did want to ask is the

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,560
model t program did anybody want to

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
speak to that i don't know that there's

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,600
been a huge amount of activity

98
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,639
but that is something that is certainly

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:57,840
on the radar of

100
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:57,840
roman and myself

101
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,758
i have to scroll through the participant

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
list to see who all is even

103
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,320
in the room

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,198
so i guess we we do not have anybody to

105
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,639
speak to that particularly so

106
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,639
let us move on to the next slide

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,960
so to give some highlights

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,880
i think much of this

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,320
at least in terms of which items are on

110
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,600
the slide has not changed

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,759
since 108. i do still have a couple of

112
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
80 sponsored drafts that i'm working

113
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,720
through

114
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,599
i know uh fernando has updated the

115
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,600
miracle id security considerations uh

116
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,479
actually a couple months ago but i just

117
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,120
got back to him

118
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,919
yesterday so that should be ready to go

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,919
out for

120
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,240
itf last call and then the security txt

121
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,599
already did go through itf last call and

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
got a

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,000
significant volume of comments i have

124
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,680
attempted to go through them

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,120
and then try to extract out the

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,039
technical bits and

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,479
work with authors to make changes to

128
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
address them

129
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
but i still have to do my final pass to

130
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,680
sort of

131
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,080
go through the actual changes in the

132
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
document to see whether or not

133
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,599
the review comments have actually been

134
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,719
addressed so that's still

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,000
waiting for my uh additional

136
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,919
review follow-up and

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
potentially would either have more

138
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,560
changes to

139
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,319
the draft or potentially go to the isg

140
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,720
depending on the results of that network

141
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
uh roman mentioned open pgp already we

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
do have the

143
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,360
rechartering or chartering process

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:51,759
in in progress for that um

145
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,880
and so that will be going to the isg

146
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,599
again in december i thought it goes

147
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,599
according to plan

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
and i do also have a call out for anyone

149
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,919
who

150
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,919
would potentially be interested in being

151
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,120
a working group chair for ace

152
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,159
we do have a opening there since

153
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,880
gym has passed so i

154
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,479
plan to be making a decision about that

155
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,880
next week

156
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,560
so if you think you might be interested

157
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
uh even if you're not sure

158
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
please reach out to me and we can talk

159
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
about what it would entail

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,840
and whether it's a good fit so that's

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,840
uh security area highlights

162
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,639

163
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,400
share opportunity in general

164
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
if you are interested in being a working

165
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,159
group chair opportunities like this

166
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
kind of always come up and so if you let

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
us know in advance what will keep you in

168
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,520
mind

169
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039

note privately just say hey

173
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,400
at some point i'd be interested and

174
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,000
we'll see whether there's a match

175
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,318
yes yes we do always like to have many

176
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,879
people to consider and get people

177
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
opportunity

178
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,199
a couple other area highlights we've had

179
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,120
a lot of discussion in recent weeks on

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,080
various vulnerability disclosure

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
guidance so we first had the discussion

182
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,758
about the

183
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,919
llc so we have a published policy for

184
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
the ietf infrastructure

185
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,080
and very much most recently which was i

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,878
think we closed it to early

187
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,718
last week we also have now documented

188
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,399
how we do vulnerability disclosure

189
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,240
in the ietf uh you can read that github

190
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,320
link there and that should be posted

191
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
relatively soon to the official website

192
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,919
the big kind of addition beyond

193
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,200
everything that we already do was first

194
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,319
having it written down

195
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:51,279
but we knew now have a last resort alias

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
that will go to ben and me if if uh that

197
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,920
discoverer

198
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,680
or that seeker of the vulnerabilities

199
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,680
can't uh can't find the right working

200
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,000
work

201
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,399
the other thing ben and i wanted to plug

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,279
is we keep a working list of

203
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
uh what we call the common uh the common

204
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,200
discussed

205
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
topics so uh if if you're working kind

206
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,720
of on a document

207
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,319
or if you were or reaching out and

208
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
helping with security issues in another

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,200
working group

210
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
we have this working kind of tick list

211
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,920
of things to consider beyond all the

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
official documentation we have

213
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
as documents go forward and if you have

214
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,360
suggestions of other things to add to

215
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
that list we also really do welcome

216
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
welcome back it's a it's a living

217
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,439
document

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,240
the other thing ben and i wanted to want

219
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,680
to just to quickly highlight

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
uh our pipeline grows and shrinks and

221
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,719
we've been really putting in a concerted

222
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,479
effort to

223
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,040
make sure that we're working kind of the

224
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,080
documents as fast as we can

225
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,240
we know that we are a gating function to

226
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080
to moving that forward so we just want

227
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
to highlight we've been pushing hard and

228
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,680
we believe

229
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,519
everything is through pub wreck as of uh

230
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,519
as of these kind of screen caps

231
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,440
a couple of kind of days ago and what we

232
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
would also kind of call out is that our

233
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,320
reviews

234
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,839
of these are kind of agile if you have a

235
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
document with us

236
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,120
in the pipeline uh you know we would

237
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,279
typically probably

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
handle it first come first serve but if

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
you have some constraints where you

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,800
think

241
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,479
there are dependencies on the documents

242
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,880
the way the authors

243
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,160
have resources requires that we look at

244
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,760
something kind of sooner

245
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,199
please don't hesitate to help us

246
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,720
re-prioritize our cue

247
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,880
to help us know what's important and

248
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
again what needs to get done and we're

249
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
happy to look at things

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,920
you know look at things in a quicker way

251
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
or a different way to make sure that it

252
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
meets those constraints we may not be

253
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,160
aware of

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,880
yes i used to second that it is very

255
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,279
helpful

256
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
if there's a particular document that

257
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,000
has some additional constraints

258
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,600
i know we're both happy to try and work

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,760
to meet those but we have to know about

260
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,160
them in order to do anything

261
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,480
uh and just to sort of reiterate that

262
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,199
the publication requested queue has gone

263
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
to zero uh but it used to be quite large

264
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,000
so there's a little bit of a bulge

265
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360
that's making its way through

266
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,920
to the the subsequent states evaluation

267
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,519
uh last call and waiting for the

268
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
write-up but we are

269
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,279
working to to keep those cues short as

270
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,519
well

271
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,519
uh so it looks like ira is in the queue

272
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,519
and that i set tried to send a couple of

273
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,680
chats

274
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
but they went into space and the chat

275
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,279
window remains empty and

276
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,000
i think it's broke um

277
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,880
you can reload the page and hopefully

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
the chat will

279
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,079
after you ask a question okay so my

280
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,199
question that i typed twice but i'm not

281
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,880
sure that it got

282
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,399
into some chat window was uh

283
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,320
is there a second

284
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:55,120
working group chair for seaboard

285
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
to follow but not replace the

286
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
irreplaceable

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,719
jim shot and help francesca

288
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,720
yours rather active

289
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,800
so the seaboard group is not in the

290
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,639
security area

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,079
so ah that's why okay not exactly our

292
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,800
problem but i do believe

293
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,719
that there is work to get a additional

294
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:22,319
chair for seaguar as well

295
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,320
thanks man uh one question that's a good

296
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
question

297
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,920
okay so i think that we can go to then

298
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:39,839
oh

299
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:39,839
dkg is awesome i apologize

300
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,519
you are pretty quiet

301
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,839
yep is that better much better

302
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,959
great um amazing what the volume knob

303
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,720
does

304
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,959
um i had a question about the security

305
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,360
vulnerabilities disclosure

306
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,279
um just a logistical question which is i

307
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
know that there is an open pgp

308
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,320
certificate

309
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
uh published so people can make

310
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,959
confidential disclosures to that

311
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,599
catch-all address uh but that is not

312
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,760
published

313
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
on probably some of the most popular key

314
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,839
servers

315
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,360
and it's also not published via wkd um

316
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
so i'm just wondering whether there's

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
any plan to publish that in one of these

318
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,560
standard lookup

319
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
locations to facilitate uh automated

320
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,760
finding

321
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,360
uh apps absolutely uh if you'll notice

322
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,439
the uh the the the write-up of that is

323
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,279
actually still a github we have not yet

324
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,079
done the necessary steps to put things

325
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,920
on uh on the website kind of itself

326
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,599
publishing the key in

327
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
in one or many kind of key servers is

328
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,519
still one of those last steps we need to

329
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,519
do

330
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
in addition to a little bit of editorial

331
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,000
polish we still have

332
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,680
so that that's on the tick list before

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
we launch okay

334
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,479
cool if there's questions about how to

335
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,600
publish and you want to reach out to me

336
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,800
i'm happy to try to work with you on

337
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,320
that

338
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,920
absolutely i really appreciate it thanks

339
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
for the reminder sure

340
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,839
thank you

341
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,839
okay now the queue is empty so we can go

342
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,839
to the next slide

343
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,160
so ben and i just really wanted to

344
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,319
reiterate uh

345
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
you know while we do a lot of document

346
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,920
uh review

347
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,360
there's a tremendous amount of magic and

348
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,599
effort that happens

349
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
before things get to us and things that

350
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,760
happen that tremendously also help us

351
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,240
and that's only possible through the sec

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,560
review sector review process

353
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,519
folks uh on that team give really of

354
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
themselves

355
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,720
and they shoulder quite a heavy burden

356
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,719
to do either last call reviews

357
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
they are there for the telechat reviews

358
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,079
they are the resources

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,160
we have when working groups want an

360
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,160
early review and do that iteration

361
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,399
and it frankly makes the document

362
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,120
quality by the time it gets to the isg

363
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,760
so much better and we can't thank that

364
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
team

365
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,199
that that team enough for for what they

366
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
do and so we just wanted to quickly

367
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
publicly recognize

368
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,760
all of the reviews that have happened

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
and who those reviewers have been since

370
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,480
the last time we got together

371
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,040
uh in ietf 108. so again really kind of

372
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
thank you

373
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,160
thank you everyone you're really helping

374
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
us in the community

375
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,000
yes a huge thank you to all the

376
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,680
reviewers and i think we

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,199
we checked pretty hard to make sure the

378
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,160
list was complete

379
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,639
but if we by some accident left your

380
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,360
name off we are deeply sorry and we do

381
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,360
thank you as well

382
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
all right so the next agenda item was

383
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,279
this sort of

384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,240
terminology question about you know on

385
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,839
path or

386
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
man in the middle and what does this

387
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,120
actually mean so if we go

388
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,519
to the next slide um

389
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
this was a thread that was actually just

390
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
that was started on sag

391
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,479
by michael richardson and so i've got

392
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,120
the link

393
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,560
in the slides to the the initial message

394
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,680
of the thread and then

395
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,199
mica also tried to do a summary as well

396
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,959
probably a few days ago at this point

397
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:14,079
though the days are learning together

398
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,839
but to sort of reiterate some of that if

399
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,079
we go to the next slide

400
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,279
to reiterate some of that for this

401
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,239
audience

402
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,199
there were a few interesting points so

403
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,519
obviously

404
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,599
many of these terms that we bandy around

405
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,440
don't actually have a precise definition

406
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,519
i mean in the middle has been used for

407
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,680
probably decades

408
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,680
and sort of the landscape in which we

409
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:40,000
try to use it has changed around us

410
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,239
so we don't necessarily always have

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,519
a clear agreement on what we mean when

412
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,440
we say that and that can be

413
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
harmful when we're trying to have

414
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,360
specific technical discussions

415
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,399
and it also came up that even the notion

416
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,079
of being on path

417
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,800
is a little bit malleable or fungible

418
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,439
in terms of what context you're talking

419
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
about being on path in

420
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
and then there's this sort of metapoint

421
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
that the the path itself could be

422
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,559
subject to attack or could change over

423
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,600
time

424
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,399
so if you could be on path only some of

425
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,039
the time

426
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,240
then that's another consideration as

427
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,839
well

428
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,280
uh and of course there's this

429
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,039
overarching point about

430
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
how much do we really care if we should

431
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,480
be trying to design against the

432
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,720
the strongest attacker that we can

433
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,319
imagine uh well that's not

434
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,679
tricky strictly true but if we if we're

435
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,720
trying to design as a very strong

436
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,000
attacker

437
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,760
uh then the notion of on path are not

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
is in some sense irrelevant because we

439
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,720
want to protect against it no matter

440
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,120
what it is

441
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,080
but there are in fact some cases where

442
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
having the sort of

443
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
distinction between different classes of

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,760
attacks is useful

445
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,039
and that we can sort of be able to

446
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,160
discriminate

447
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,600
when you know when one thing would be a

448
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
problem or when it would not

449
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,039
and to be able to talk about the

450
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,240
distinctions versus just

451
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
there's an attack and there's not an

452
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
attack there can be a lot of context

453
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,880
around that

454
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,678
in terms of how severe it would be or in

455
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,320
what cases

456
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,320
it would be problematic so next slide

457
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,039
and to sort of continue the theme of

458
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,720
summarizing the list discussion

459
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,160
there was a couple of different

460
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,200
taxonomies that were

461
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,880
proposed or repeated so

462
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,559
in quick there's the on path they're

463
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,120
limited on path that can't

464
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,480
delete messages that can observe them

465
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,280
and then the

466
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
classical off path attacker or you could

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,360
have the

468
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
middle on the side and the rough for

469
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,959
roughly the same sorts of things or if

470
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,959
you like your alliteration the

471
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
malicious messenger oppressive observer

472
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,240
and chaos creator

473
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,559
but if we go to the next slide there's

474
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,120
sort of some questions about are are

475
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,918
these really a useful taxonomy to have

476
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,559
like is there more detail in what's

477
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,559
going on

478
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,840
that we need to have turns to be able to

479
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,399
talk about

480
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,959
uh and of course the pervasive question

481
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,120
or the theme of this talk perhaps even

482
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,320
are these terms well defined and

483
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,520
unambiguous

484
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,960
are they useful when we need to have

485
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,559
specific precise discussions about

486
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,559
what the status of the protocol is

487
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
so

488
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,240
first off if anybody has a immediate

489
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,480
response to

490
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,559
either of these questions uh please go

491
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,799
ahead and join the queue

492
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,520
this is not supposed to be me talking to

493
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,160
y'all for the the whole time it's uh

494
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,720
goal is to have a conversation so paul

495
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,720
please go ahead

496
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
greetings so um we're having some of

497
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,640
these same questions

498
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,160
in deprived right now um

499
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,000
so i would be willing to edit

500
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
a document as long as i was not the

501
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,120
person deciding

502
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,320
consensus this is obviously full of bike

503
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
sheds as we saw

504
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,840
on the last slide

505
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,479
but it is real i think it would be very

506
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,879
important

507
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:15,200
for um the itf in general to have

508
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,720
a small set that are usable currently

509
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,480
across working groups we've had old

510
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,520
definitions and such like that but i

511
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,280
think

512
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,918
doing something and trying to finish it

513
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,120
within the next nine months or a year

514
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,200
um would be really useful to um

515
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,199
a few a few working groups so i'd be

516
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
willing to edit as long as

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
um maybe uh ben and roman would be the

518
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,400
ones

519
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,000
who were deciding consensus and such

520
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,880
like that

521
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,799
okay i mean glad to hear that you think

522
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
a document would be useful in a space to

523
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,480
really sell things down

524
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,600
that was uh even not something i was

525
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
sure about

526
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,039
and thank you as well for the offer to

527
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,080
document

528
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,080
jonathan please

529
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,559
um i think this is the kind of thing

530
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,000
where

531
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,240
we should just look to academia i'm sure

532
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,559
or we can't think of a particular paper

533
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,760
right now but i'm sure that there are

534
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,918
very comprehensive taxonomies and just

535
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,200
limiting it to sort of three levels of

536
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,760
attacker

537
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,480
is not particularly useful because

538
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,799
especially

539
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
at least with the tls analysis we're

540
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,320
also assuming a sacker that can

541
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,799
compromise

542
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,799
some subset of the participants in the

543
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,879
protocol

544
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,000
at which point you're going to have to

545
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,000
have you know

546
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,440
it can get much more complicated than

547
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,120
three layers um

548
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,919
so i feel like this is just something we

549
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,199
should contact you

550
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,360
that's a good point do you know uh

551
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,960
if you or yourself or maybe somebody

552
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,039
else might be able to

553
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,440
take some time to go look through the

554
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
literature

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,440
uh i'm happy to look through the

556
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,959
literature

557
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:03,440
thank you that would be quite helpful

558
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,240
uh and presumably the results of that

559
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,039
can

560
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,240
be input for paul as we try to prepare a

561
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,600
potential document

562
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,880
for specific usage in the itf of

563
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,959
summarize what we found from the

564
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,120
literature

565
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,960
so jonathan i assume you're done so you

566
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,360
can leave the queue

567
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,520
i don't think i have the option to do

568
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
that

569
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,120
joe

570
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,240
hello so i'm wondering if

571
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,199
uh this is something that would go along

572
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,159
with the model t

573
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
working it seems like the attackers

574
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,440
might be

575
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,760
in scope for remodeling

576
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,559
yeah that was another question that was

577
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
not really

578
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,360
clear to us

579
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,520
in terms of the actual model itself

580
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,600
versus the terms to talk about it

581
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,360
versus the terms to talk about the model

582
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,480
we currently have

583
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,039
so it's probably something that models

584
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
he

585
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,039
could or even should be thinking about

586
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,480
but we may want to have

587
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,120
a terminology set that's useful for us

588
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,600
even before the model t work has

589
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,600
finished

590
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,840
okay so jim is up next i believe

591
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,520
hi um i guess you can hear me

592
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,120
i see the little bar there so i'm a

593
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
little bit confused about what problem

594
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,918
we're actually trying to solve here

595
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,280
uh is this a question of inclusive

596
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,039
terminology

597
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,720
or is this a an issue of uh

598
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,600
i i thought that was kind of where this

599
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,720
came from but it seems like there's also

600
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,120
an issue of

601
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:54,559
of trying to come up with more um

602
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,559
a finer grain definition of what a

603
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,080
an in the middle attack is um so

604
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,879
i i guess i'd like to understand that

605
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:06,879
and if it's in terms of the

606
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,440
um in terms of the inclusive terminology

607
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
uh there's also this other work that's

608
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,440
going on in the

609
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,799
ietf terminology github repository

610
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,960
and i don't know exactly who's

611
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,918
who's managing that or or what what

612
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
working group or

613
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
or whatever is is dealing with that but

614
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,720
but that's going on as well and i'm

615
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,240
seeing that cited

616
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,159
externally okay um just a

617
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,840
administrative note i do have i think

618
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,520
one or two more slides so i will cut the

619
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,959
cue on this slide and we

620
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,158
can go drain this cue and then go on a

621
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,880
little bit more

622
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
to answer jim's question now the primary

623
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,760
problem here is that

624
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,840
when you say man in the middle not

625
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,360
everybody is thinking the same thing

626
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
and we would like people to all be

627
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,320
thinking about the same thing for any

628
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,600
given term

629
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,439
so we just want to make sure that we

630
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,520
have accurate and precise terms that

631
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,880
everybody knows the meaning of

632
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,679
uh any sort of inclusivity would be a

633
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,679
secondary effect

634
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,678
so jim is not sending anymore so i think

635
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,959
that we assume that answers his question

636
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,799
john you're back

637
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:20,080
jonathan uh just relaying from

638
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,918
jabba uh mohit puts if we're going to

639
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,240
work on taxonomy and terminology is it

640
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,240
worth revisiting rfc 4949

641
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,720
that is an interesting question to

642
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,000
consider

643
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
i am going to propose that we punt that

644
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,760
to the

645
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:43,840
email list because i at least was not

646
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,840
prepared to talk about it right now

647
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,320
uh but thank you for relaying from jair

648
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,799
so hans europe

649
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,720
hi um i was i wanted to suggest that we

650
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,000
if we come up with some new terminology

651
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,799
that it actually can

652
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,679
be um used also in some form and

653
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,760
analysis

654
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,840
i think it would be unfortunate if we

655
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,879
have all these different terms um

656
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,600
fine-grained terms and then there's no

657
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,840
equivalent way to use those in the

658
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,840
underlying formal technologies

659
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,600
for formal analysis because nowadays we

660
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,520
use them more and more often

661
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,678
so that be better be some mapping

662
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,400
between those

663
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
that's a very good point i hope that the

664
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,520
academic literature

665
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,679
is is framed in a way that would be

666
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,320
consistent with that but

667
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,279
uh if we get some results back from that

668
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,840
search we can

669
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,840
definitely keep that in mind as well

670
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,520
okay lost cuest jonathan

671
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,760
actually there is paul pulls back

672
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,770
so yeah just a quick answer to a jim

673
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,400
fenton um

674
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,400
[Music]

675
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
the other reason why having good

676
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,320
terminology is important is not just so

677
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
that we in the ietf expression security

678
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,480
or understand it

679
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,120
but people reading papers that we

680
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,640
write about our protocols do as well and

681
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,879
a very good example is

682
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
in a paper that i've written recently i

683
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,159
used um

684
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,080
a man in the middle machine in the

685
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,880
middle attacker in the middle and

686
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,559
uh got some interesting responses from

687
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,840
security novices but people who

688
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,158
understand the internet

689
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,678
one is with man in the middle is they

690
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,840
said well does the person have to be

691
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,640
sitting there watching all the time

692
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
um and so you know clearly we should

693
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,159
make

694
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,799
whatever that um whatever that phrase is

695
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,440
going to be

696
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,639
clear that it's it's not a person um you

697
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
know that which is a completely

698
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
understandable thing

699
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,960
but the other is and this has come up a

700
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,760
lot with the questions around

701
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,720
um dough is it's really not in the

702
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,720
middle

703
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,360
almost all of these attacks are very

704
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
very near one edge or the other

705
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,678
and so i mean i probably was in the

706
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,000
middle 20 30 years ago

707
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,039
but now most of the ones that we are

708
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,760
concerned about

709
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,960
are in fact um or not i shouldn't say

710
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
most but many of the ones we were

711
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
concerned about

712
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,360
are in fact very near an edge so saying

713
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,919
in the middle

714
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,120
um hides some of the attacks that we

715
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,919
actually care about

716
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,039
namely system administrators putting uh

717
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,840
um

718
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,840
security busting proxies uh near users

719
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,120
that's also a good point uh

720
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
okay so i think i said we would drain

721
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
the queue on this slide and then there's

722
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,080
a little bit

723
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,360
on the next slide as well to sort of dig

724
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,199
into

725
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:38,240
perhaps a more detailed or finer grained

726
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,880
taxonomy so

727
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,159
this i think was mostly just summarizing

728
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,320
what had already been

729
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
sent on the list maybe a little bit of

730
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,840
brainstorming for me as well

731
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,039
um and i just want to make sure that we

732
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,120
have the slide up

733
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:59,440
to see if it would prompt any further

734
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,559
thoughts from anybody uh in terms of

735
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,000
triggering training new ideas but i

736
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,480
think

737
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,840
we seem to be getting some general

738
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,880
support for doing something in this

739
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,399
space

740
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,320
we will want to

741
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,479
not do it in isolation from the work

742
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
that multi is doing

743
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,559
uh there's some other considerations to

744
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,559
take into consideration as well

745
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,080
uh so this is actually the last slide so

746
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,039
the queue is

747
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,720
is open again sorry for the strange

748
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,840
split with the the question

749
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,320
slide but i think my

750
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,279
overall takeaways here are that yes it's

751
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,720
sounding like we

752
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,039
do want to have a

753
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,200
more fine-grained more precise set of

754
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,158
terminology that we can use

755
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
and there's definitely some constraints

756
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
on

757
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,159
how we should do that to make it most

758
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,840
usable for us

759
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,840
and for others

760
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,879
okay bob is in the cube

761
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,720
go ahead bob uh i'm wondering that we

762
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,520
need to make any distinction between

763
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,960
peer-wise communications multi-user

764
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
communications

765
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,799
broadcast communications for my focus is

766
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,158
right now

767
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,639
um do we need to is is that at all

768
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,640
a factor in this discussion

769
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,279
uh i think we are kind of at a

770
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,158
brainstorming

771
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,440
point in the process so we're not even

772
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,399
starting the discussion yet

773
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,760
so i think it's perfectly reasonable to

774
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,639
consider if that should be part of the

775
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,640
discussion as well

776
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,440
okay

777
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
uh roman did you have a point you were

778
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,919
gonna say

779
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,279
i just wanted to reiterate two of the

780
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,159
other constraints we heard in the

781
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,320
discussion

782
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,679
uh from the jet from jabber i think

783
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
mohit was saying you know we should make

784
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,320
sure we

785
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,158
we stare at the written guidance we

786
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,480
already have in the ietf

787
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,279
and jonathan noted uh and hottest

788
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,440
reiterated

789
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,960
the idea that the academic literature

790
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,640
may also have kind of things to say and

791
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,559
we want to make sure what's there

792
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,080
is consistent and we make make sure we

793
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,240
don't publish something that conflicts

794
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
sounds good so just one more sort of

795
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
logistical question

796
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,679
is if we are happy to

797
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,679
have this discussion on sag itself

798
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
or if people think it might become too

799
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,000
high traffic and we should split off a

800
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,678
dedicated

801
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,360
mailing list for that i don't think we

802
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,880
have to answer that right now

803
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,360
but people can probably leave their

804
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,640
thoughts

805
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,639
in the jabber or on email and

806
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,320
i guess room and i can take an action

807
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
item to maybe

808
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,000
cycle back in a couple weeks and try and

809
00:31:50,640 --> 00:32:01,120
actually kick start

810
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:05,200
an effort to to work on this topic

811
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:09,918
so queue is empty

812
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,919
uh catch up on chat

813
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,158
okay there's there's a robust discussion

814
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,158
kind of happening there but no opinions

815
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,000
on where this goes

816
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:26,840
yes uh so i think we should move on

817
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,039
to the invited talk so i believe i saw

818
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,360
ryan

819
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,360
in the participant list

820
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,440
so ryan i think you can just go ahead

821
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,200
and start sending

822
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,559
audio and option video as well

823
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,000
i shall do that all right

824
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,918
hopefully this is working i see the blue

825
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
bar moving yes

826
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,640
we can hear you so please uh go ahead

827
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,880
and i roman's driving the slides so

828
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,679
all right perfect well thanks for having

829
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,240
me um i

830
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,679
i will give a warning here uh these

831
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,880
slides are packed dent

832
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,159
my intent is not to go over them um

833
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,880
but if you find me exceeding 0.8 eckerd

834
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,600
please yell and i will try to slow down

835
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,679
um

836
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,959
when it comes to some of these topics i

837
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,279
i know that

838
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,320
many people participated in some of the

839
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,559
discussions that

840
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,080
i'll be discussing my intent is to

841
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,720
misrepresent things

842
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,399
uh so if you find something that that

843
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,279
you uh don't believe is accurately

844
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,959
presented

845
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,880
please do correct me the only thing i

846
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,919
would encourage is uh could you save it

847
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,080
to the end

848
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,399
um to see how much it impacts things

849
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,480
well just to help things progress

850
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,799
so with that we can go ahead to the next

851
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,159
slide

852
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,360
all right so yes uh this talk um it's

853
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,880
intended for people designing

854
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,399
implementing or using a protocol that

855
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,159
uses certificates

856
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
this is not meant to be the how do you

857
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,919
run your pki for your organization

858
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,360
it's more about how do you run a pki on

859
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,960
the internet um

860
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,959
i'm not trying to tell you how to run a

861
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,399
pk on the internet but i'm trying to

862
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,000
share some stories about what's worked

863
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,359
and what's not worked so next slide

864
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,440
um so uh part of

865
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,799
where this talk came from was discussion

866
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,079
about uh the use of

867
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
what colloquially we call the web pki

868
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,560
and there was some confusion you know

869
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,598
what's the problem with using the web

870
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,040
pki and

871
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,560
what are the gotchas um so this

872
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,239
is interesting for you if you're not

873
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,799
sure what the web pki is

874
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,000
uh you hate the web pki or you love the

875
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,040
web pki

876
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,879
um and there is some implied you know

877
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,960
thinking that needs to be done on if you

878
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,560
think mutual tls is all that great or

879
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,839
it's an easy solution

880
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,399
so we can go ahead and next slide

881
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,520
so i said the word web pki i know i have

882
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,199
a reputation

883
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
in that space this is not about how the

884
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,399
web pki is awesome or how you should

885
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,239
follow the model

886
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,598
it's about painful lessons and how you

887
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,439
can learn from these

888
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
uh mistakes over the course of two

889
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,240
decades and hopefully avoid them

890
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,200
next slide so it's uh

891
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,399
split into uh sort of two parts an

892
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,240
evolution of

893
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,640
what i would call the internet pki and

894
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,839
the web pki and you'll see a bit more

895
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
about what that means

896
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,839
and then discussing about how that

897
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,440
practically works uh for requirements

898
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,000
for pki

899
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,599
so you can go ahead next slide and i

900
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,079
guess i don't need the covers

901
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,119
here's the next slide so the first one

902
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,480
that i'm going to talk about

903
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,720
is the pki and i'm calling this pki 0.1

904
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,920
it's sort of the the alpha

905
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,520
it comes about x5 988 uh and

906
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,280
the important part to sort of capture

907
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,079
here when we talk about what does

908
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,800
the x509 pki was part of the directory

909
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
you know it was

910
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,480
it was merely an authentication protocol

911
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,759
that fit into the overall

912
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,200
x500 series of of

913
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,359
specifications describe how the

914
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,640
directory worked it established one

915
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,240
right way to name things

916
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,319
this was the notion of the distinguished

917
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,279
name a globally unique name

918
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,079
that there was one true directory that

919
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,240
it had all

920
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
the information you could need or want

921
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,399
you could just look it up in the

922
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
directory and so the

923
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,440
need for certificates was very little it

924
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,599
was merely as

925
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,040
a asymmetric cryptographic exchange to

926
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
authenticate to the directory

927
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,560
and after that everything you needed

928
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,000
would be in the directory or if you need

929
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,759
to communicate with someone in the

930
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,280
directory you could use it to look up

931
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,800
their information and communicate with

932
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,720
them there

933
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,000
next slide so around this time as well

934
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,000
we saw the evolution of what i would

935
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,520
call internet pki 0.1

936
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,280
and i know i'm going to bring back some

937
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,359
bad memories for folks who are involved

938
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,000
in privacy enhanced mail

939
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,359
because this was a very difficult time

940
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,560
to sort of figure out how this should

941
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,720
work

942
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,160
it made use of x 509 certificates but

943
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,118
without the inherent dependency on the

944
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,000
directory

945
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,880
um the first sort of approach was as you

946
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,200
see in rc

947
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,599
1114 that there was a way to name things

948
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,520
but it was mostly determined by rsa dsi

949
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,680
they were going to run the pki

950
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,440
for everyone and they would be able to

951
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,359
certify what are known as organizational

952
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
notaries who would then be responsible

953
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
for

954
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,520
within the scope of that organization

955
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,279
defining a namespace

956
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,960
now not everyone was organizationally

957
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
affiliated so for those that were

958
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,920
residential rsa would also run a ca

959
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,079
now despite there being organizational

960
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,160
notaries the suggestion was that rsa

961
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,240
would in fact run these as well on a

962
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,240
practical sense since running a pki is

963
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,640
hard

964
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,799
in the subsequent uh privacy enhancement

965
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,040
rcrs 1422

966
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,240
it became a bit more complex uh the

967
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,960
suggestion was that the

968
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,560
isoc or that isak would run what's known

969
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,200
as the internet policy registration

970
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
authority

971
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,399
which would be the root of trust for the

972
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,760
internet pki

973
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
and it would register policy

974
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,119
certification authorities that defined

975
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
policies appropriate for their

976
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,560
communities

977
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,520
and within there cas would be determined

978
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,279
whether or not they meet those policies

979
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,960
now the source of information here since

980
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,240
you're not really using the directory

981
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
comes from the message headers

982
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,879
everything you need is sort of in the

983
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,720
message that you get

984
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,160
and you don't need to go through any

985
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,118
lookups because it's a very

986
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,118
flat structure right you have the policy

987
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,079
registration authority the policy cas

988
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,440
and the cas

989
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,280
beneath them but you don't really get

990
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,720
much deeper than that

991
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,119
next slide so

992
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,160
around this time netscape comes to town

993
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,359
with ssl

994
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,078
kicks it off in november 1994. i would

995
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,000
say

996
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,520
it's cold was rough consensus in running

997
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,040
code but they sort of did a side step

998
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,240
around the ietf

999
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,320
uh because they were concerned it was

1000
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,879
going to take too long so they threw up

1001
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,800
a

1002
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,280
rough draft spec as well as shipped a

1003
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,520
very beta copy of navigator

1004
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,359
that implement ssl and the reason for

1005
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,440
doing it this way was they were

1006
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,119
as reportedly deeply concerned about

1007
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,960
what microsoft would do

1008
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,800
in terms of bringing commerce to the web

1009
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,760
and so they wanted to be there first to

1010
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,560
ensure that there wasn't

1011
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,920
a proprietary solution another part of

1012
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,920
this though was also that they were

1013
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,520
aiming for minimal change to existing

1014
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
software it needed to work on the

1015
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,160
computers people had with the software

1016
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
people had

1017
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,078
and so this largely meant doing things

1018
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
in user land which is why it became the

1019
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,440
secure socket layer no other changes

1020
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,118
and they used x509 because rsa said to

1021
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,640
use x5x9 and that seemed like a good

1022
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,839
idea at the time what else are you going

1023
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,040
to use

1024
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,880
and there was very little external

1025
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,800
dependencies so the very first version

1026
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,599
of netscape

1027
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,480
it merely checked against a list of

1028
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,920
issuers that were baked into the binary

1029
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,520
and every certificate was directly

1030
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,320
issued by one of those issues there were

1031
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,880
no chains

1032
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,320
there were no change in the protocol uh

1033
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,400
naming rules

1034
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,160
there were no naming rules in fact there

1035
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
wasn't really anything going on

1036
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,920
whatsoever so in the early versions

1037
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,520
there was nothing being checked the idea

1038
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,040
is that users would manually inspect

1039
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,320
certificates and decide whether or not

1040
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,400
to continue

1041
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,400
um after they released the specification

1042
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,119
cypherpunk's fan pointed out that hey

1043
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,720
maybe you should actually check that

1044
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,960
this was the server you intended

1045
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,839
because just because the server has a

1046
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,520
certificate

1047
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,119
doesn't mean it's the right certificate

1048
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,720
if i have my certificate i can pretend

1049
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,280
to be the server

1050
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,279
next slide

1051
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,119
so after netscape came out with that

1052
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,680
spec

1053
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,560
we saw at iutf33 the secure socket layer

1054
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,000
both

1055
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,759
and you saw if you look through the

1056
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,440
minutes you'll find some very exciting

1057
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,960
statements such as you know if that east

1058
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
lake and kaufman

1059
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
idea works out which would become dns

1060
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,560
sec then maybe we wouldn't need this

1061
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,079
whole pki thing

1062
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,920
and uh if that ipsp which would become

1063
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,760
ipsec worked out then maybe we don't

1064
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,280
need this whole ssl thing but

1065
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
we need something now and we need to

1066
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,000
have it shipped and it needs to be able

1067
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,359
to work so

1068
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,599
we have it and this became secretly

1069
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,960
shortly thereafter etf 34 was the first

1070
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,400
meeting of pkx

1071
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,000
and you can find a little bit about the

1072
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,000
history of why that was

1073
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,359
um that the work on pen had revealed

1074
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,359
that it's actually really hard

1075
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,799
to ucas on the internet there were a lot

1076
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,680
of limitations

1077
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,720
um the itu had a proposed number of

1078
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,598
changes that became excellent 509 v3

1079
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,240
and particular extensions um now the

1080
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,160
goal with

1081
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,240
pkx and i hope i again am not

1082
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,000
misrepresenting anything was no presumed

1083
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,560
dependency on the directory to allow

1084
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,839
multiple routes without necessarily the

1085
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,520
isoc running the route or having rsa

1086
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,520
run the route with many ways to name

1087
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,200
things um there were some important

1088
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,880
goals that were set out in that first

1089
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,799
draft that would become

1090
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,400
many of these rfcs which is minimal

1091
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,079
configuration by users

1092
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,839
minimal interactivity requirements

1093
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,640
things need needed to be able to be

1094
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,599
automated

1095
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,200
and verified with automated tools and

1096
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,200
boy golly gee wouldn't it be nice to

1097
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,759
have automatable certificate enrollment

1098
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,879
management using well-defined protocols

1099
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
now that took

1100
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
a number of years from when that work

1101
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,720
started to when that work was specified

1102
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
and all the meantime netscape and

1103
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,000
microsoft were waging a

1104
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,000
very exciting war next slide

1105
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,839
so this is where i call web pki versus

1106
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,160
internet pki this period where

1107
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,839
the pki that netscape had deployed

1108
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,200
really started off with presumption of

1109
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,200
user interactivity

1110
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,319
they did add the common name checking

1111
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,480
and would later add

1112
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
subject alternative name checking but

1113
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,760
really the assumption was users

1114
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,480
will be inspecting using the document

1115
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,839
information um it also had that fun

1116
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,520
exciting side effect that if you

1117
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,040
encountered a ca you didn't know

1118
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,520
it would handily prompt you do you want

1119
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,119
to trust the ca not warn you

1120
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,839
but suggest you probably want to trust

1121
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,359
to see it uh the web pki this time

1122
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,839
assumed a strong connectivity to the

1123
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,598
internet

1124
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,359
your client software you're talking to a

1125
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
server you're talking to the internet at

1126
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,560
large

1127
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,399
not to say firewalls weren't popular but

1128
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,839
the assumption here in this pki was

1129
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,280
you're on a client and you're talking to

1130
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,599
sort of the broader internet

1131
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,599
whereas pkx wanted to consider in very

1132
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,040
explicitly situations like firewalls and

1133
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,720
limited traffic

1134
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,440
web pki was focused on browsers

1135
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,000
and it started off that way but the

1136
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,079
movement

1137
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,359
by microsoft to move ie into the

1138
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,440
operating system

1139
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,240
started to create what i would argue is

1140
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,480
the the precursor to the internet pki

1141
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,160
um because they wanted to expose these

1142
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,800
services a sort of general operating

1143
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,440
service

1144
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,880
or sorry operating system level services

1145
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,319
where anyone could write an internet

1146
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,240
enabled application

1147
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,240
whereas netscape it started off really

1148
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,799
focused on the browser

1149
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,560
netscape would add support for ssl to

1150
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,760
some of their other protocols like

1151
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,520
smtp and ftp but uh in

1152
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,880
with respect to the communicator product

1153
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,920
but this wasn't sort of how things

1154
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,800
started

1155
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,480
and it blurred the lines between the web

1156
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,319
pki and internet pki

1157
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,839
because here's a set of cas that can be

1158
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,680
used for a variety of protocols a

1159
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,400
variety of internet services

1160
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,919
and it just works is it supposed to be

1161
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,800
just for the web is it supposed to be

1162
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,119
for anything

1163
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,359
it was a bit ambiguous and the selection

1164
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,119
of cas was admittedly very weak

1165
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,598
it was mostly based on organizational

1166
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,400
reputation and business risk

1167
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,960
not necessarily security risk so you're

1168
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,960
a bank

1169
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,960
you issue certificates you seem pretty

1170
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,119
trustworthy because you're a bank

1171
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,960
there's a lot of regulation around banks

1172
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,200
so that was what made a lot of the early

1173
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,400
ca's the audits wouldn't come until fair

1174
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,439
next slide so i'm going to call this the

1175
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,480
precursor to the web pki

1176
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,119
this this is when things started to

1177
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,680
get really messy so the ca browser forum

1178
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,000
coming about in 2006 2007

1179
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,000
started blurring things uh it started

1180
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,560
cab form started because cas were

1181
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,319
unhappy that certain competitors were

1182
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,880
issuing certificates with only domain

1183
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,560
names

1184
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,319
they felt that this was fundamentally

1185
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,920
the wrong way to do certificates

1186
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,680
because they had started out with legal

1187
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,280
names even though pkix

1188
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,720
was really oriented around internet

1189
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,640
naming browsers were unhappy with cas

1190
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,839
in terms of just how widely divergent

1191
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,078
everything was

1192
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,160
so a meeting was held did not go the way

1193
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,079
that the originators intended

1194
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,200
because rather than forbidding domain

1195
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,119
validation

1196
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,200
what ended up being is development of a

1197
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,960
new standard ev

1198
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,960
browsers were interested in combating

1199
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,359
phishing microsoft most of all

1200
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,880
with internet explorer and so they

1201
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,640
propose this ev standard

1202
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,599
and the reason why i call this like web

1203
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,759
pki 0.9 is it developed a pki that was

1204
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,599
very focused on user interactivity

1205
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,520
and it was very focused on web browsers

1206
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,599
and web browser specific needs

1207
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,440
the semantics of an ev certificate

1208
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,520
outside of a web browser

1209
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,880
really don't make sense yes there's some

1210
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,400
additional validation

1211
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,400
but none of that is actually part of the

1212
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,599
processing model of a certificate

1213
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,880
of rfc 3280 2459

1214
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,599
80. so it's a very application specific

1215
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,960
pki

1216
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,720
so that's why i'm calling it web pci 0.9

1217
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,040
and this is where they diverge next

1218
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
slide

1219
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,040
and so what i'm calling the birth of the

1220
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,440
web pki

1221
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,880
was when the cab forum adopted the

1222
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,359
baseline requirements

1223
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,240
so the context here is the cab form was

1224
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,720
created

1225
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,399
ca some cas i should say were unhappy

1226
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,560
about domain validation

1227
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,640
in certificates created this new ev

1228
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,560
standard so now they want to come back

1229
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,799
to minimum standards and figure out what

1230
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,799
is the absolute bare minimum

1231
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,160
for certificates and the work on this

1232
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,200
what made progress

1233
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,040
was incredibly contentious and

1234
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,480
incredibly profane on the mailing list i

1235
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,800
will say

1236
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,960
and then diginotar happened and did you

1237
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,160
know turner happened in 2011 in the fall

1238
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,920
of 2011

1239
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,160
and i really should trust uh in the

1240
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,520
system and the version that had been

1241
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,480
circulated that had been quite

1242
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,319
controversial

1243
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,319
which allowed for both domain validation

1244
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,720
and organizational validation

1245
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:22,640
came about and it also set up a number

1246
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,959
of policies for how certificates could

1247
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,799
be issued when they would be issued

1248
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,040
most importantly for example is the

1249
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,359
deprecation of 10 24-bit certificates

1250
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,279
was

1251
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,000
in that very first version what it said

1252
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,000
was that after

1253
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,880
december 31st 2013 cas would no longer

1254
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
issue

1255
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,960
10 24-bit certificates and the reason

1256
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,640
why this focused on issuance was

1257
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,760
browsers were concerned about backwards

1258
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,520
compatibility

1259
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,160
they wanted to be able to continue to

1260
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,599
accept certificates that had been issued

1261
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,960
while making sure that no new

1262
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,599
certificates were going to have the

1263
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,599
problem

1264
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,839
and so they relied on this by preventing

1265
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,280
cas from issuing the new certificates

1266
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,680
and that way they did not have to

1267
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,400
disable the 10 24-bit code within their

1268
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,000
product

1269
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,319
until the majority of servers had

1270
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,119
migrated off their existing 10-24-bit

1271
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,880
certificates so

1272
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,400
it was a bit of a flag day and a way for

1273
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,800
managing that but

1274
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,119
importantly it also marks a point where

1275
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,880
browsers really began to tell cas

1276
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,119
what they can and can't do and that's

1277
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,040
why i call it the birth of the web pki

1278
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,079
because it was a set an application

1279
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,400
community defining policies for the cas

1280
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,800
and for the pki

1281
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,400
shortly thereafter and i say shortly in

1282
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,319
order of years

1283
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,480
another deprecation followed which was

1284
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,558
the deprecation of sha-1 which had a

1285
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,520
similar sort of sunset date where no new

1286
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,240
certificates could be issued

1287
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,680
and this this sets us up for the web pki

1288
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,439
and sets up some of the conflict that

1289
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,440
i'll be discussing

1290
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,680
next slide so it would not be

1291
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,440
correct to talk about web pki 1.0

1292
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,319
without talking about 2.0

1293
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,000
and what what i'm calling web pki 2.0 is

1294
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,079
really the point in which people realize

1295
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,160
that there were in fact separate pkis

1296
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,640
that there was this concept of

1297
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,558
a web pki being a majorly different

1298
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,400
thing that it wasn't just about the

1299
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,359
software verification quirks within

1300
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,880
browsers

1301
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,119
but in fact that there were a different

1302
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,400
set of policies and expectations

1303
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
and needs in user communities and so

1304
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,520
symantec

1305
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,598
largest ca their history of key material

1306
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,440
goes back to the days of rsa dsi and

1307
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,280
verisign and i do see some you know

1308
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,640
participants here who were around

1309
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,160
verisign at those days had some issues

1310
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,720
and ultimately got distrusted in

1311
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,078
browsers but the problem was the roots

1312
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,078
were embedded on virtually

1313
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,440
every device out there part of that was

1314
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,920
by design of rsa

1315
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,960
which was in the early days if you

1316
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,040
wanted to get a license

1317
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,000
for the rsa patent you had to include

1318
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,520
rsa's

1319
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,119
routine material that would become the

1320
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,720
verizon group

1321
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,240
part of it though was also just that's

1322
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,919
what everyone else is doing it seems

1323
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:55,680
like a good idea

1324
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,720
so i call it the split between

1325
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,558
because we saw a lot of issues with this

1326
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,640
classic example of course is a single

1327
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,920
web server providing a single api

1328
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,200
endpoint you see it there

1329
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,359
non-updatable device a number of major

1330
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,319
media companies had set top boxes had

1331
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,558
tvs where they only trusted a few cas

1332
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,079
but all of their users used the same web

1333
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,079
server all talk to the same

1334
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,800
end point and now suddenly you had a

1335
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,880
conflict if i have an old set-top box

1336
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,720
it doesn't work with new certificates

1337
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
but if i'm using a browser it does not

1338
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,439
work with these old certificates that

1339
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,279
are being deprecated

1340
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,960
and so there wasn't a good way now and

1341
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,040
now you had to think about the situation

1342
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,559
of i have a single web server i actually

1343
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,040
need different certificates for this and

1344
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,040
i

1345
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,640
because i need different certificates i

1346
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,839
need even different domains

1347
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,078
as a way to distinguish what

1348
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,720
certificates to send

1349
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,480
the other aspect of course was that uh

1350
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,240
as part of this deprecation

1351
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,720
it was not uniform across all of

1352
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,399
symantec so some operating systems would

1353
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:55,520
continue and still to this day

1354
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:59,520
trust semantics certificates or use

1355
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,599
trust them for other formats like email

1356
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,759
and so this also revealed that different

1357
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,960
protocols have different pki needs and

1358
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,559
security needs

1359
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,839
the security issues that affected

1360
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,920
symantec as it affects the web pki

1361
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,160
some vendors decided did not affect

1362
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,119
other protocols other purposes

1363
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,078
and so i call it web pki 2.0 it's the

1364
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,040
point where i think

1365
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,000
many people i would argue outside the

1366
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,000
itf

1367
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,839
realized that there were in fact

1368
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,520
multiple pkis and brought a lot of

1369
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,480
awareness here

1370
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:34,240
so um i'm not going to jump here to talk

1371
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:37,119
about requirements for pka next slide

1372
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,439
actually next slide so again this is

1373
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,400
sort of the recap on the assumptions

1374
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,920
here

1375
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,319
that you're designing implementing using

1376
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,280
a protocol or for a format that uses

1377
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,720
certificates

1378
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,559
now why did i mention all of that

1379
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,480
history for how we got here well the

1380
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,480
reason why i mention it is that there

1381
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,520
throughout this history there were

1382
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,680
various points

1383
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,200
where we saw branches branches and

1384
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,160
approach branches in need

1385
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,680
branches in what was supported and this

1386
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,520
affected the design of these different

1387
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,680
pdfs the web pki

1388
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,640
the internet pki what's capable in

1389
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,720
software

1390
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,400
and these branches have implication if

1391
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,319
you're trying to use certificates

1392
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,400
that generally work and you have to

1393
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,558
think about what are the answers for

1394
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,200
this because they have material impact

1395
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,359
so an example next slide is thinking

1396
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,640
about the connectivity model

1397
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:25,040
next slide exactly you can see kerberos

1398
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,160
right

1399
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:30,319
kerberos has this is my terribly hacky

1400
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,319
attempt at the classic kerberos model

1401
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,160
where the client talks to a server it

1402
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:35,440
also talks to the kdc

1403
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,279
and the assumption here is that the

1404
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,200
server and the kdc don't have to talk

1405
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,880
because the client acts as the mediator

1406
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,879
so that's what it can what i mean by the

1407
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,400
connectivity model next slide

1408
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,839
x509v1's connectivity model kind of

1409
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,480
assumed that everyone was talking to the

1410
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,640
directory

1411
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,240
right x509 was just a subset of the

1412
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,920
overall directory protocols it was how

1413
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,598
you authenticated to the directory

1414
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,960
and you would use the directory to find

1415
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,319
other certificates

1416
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,240
now there was the allowance for

1417
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:01,040
out-of-band communication but the idea

1418
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,959
here is that

1419
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,400
say crls would be stored in the

1420
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,520
directory if you need to figure out

1421
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,440
certificate paths

1422
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,960
that would be stored in the directory

1423
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,480
everyone talked to the directory there

1424
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,160
was strong connectivity

1425
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,040
and equally their strong connectivity on

1426
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,960
the client server next slide

1427
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,720
the web pki connectivity model is a

1428
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,559
little messy uh we assume that the

1429
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,558
client can talk to the server

1430
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:24,240
but one of the the realities here is we

1431
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,440
don't assume that the client can talk to

1432
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,759
the ca

1433
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,559
this was realized very early on in in

1434
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,880
many of the

1435
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,480
web pki implementations that in fact

1436
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,520
it's really hard to get a packet from

1437
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,079
point a to point b

1438
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,280
on the internet reliably especially from

1439
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,680
client computers

1440
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,200
everything from local firewalls to dodgy

1441
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,480
internet connections that you don't

1442
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,240
really control

1443
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,880
so there isn't an assumed connection

1444
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:50,000
here from the client to the ca

1445
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:52,160
but there is to some hand wavy degree in

1446
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,280
modern web pki and assume connection to

1447
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,799
the browser vendor

1448
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
you need to find out if you have new

1449
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,319
updates and so you've probably got a

1450
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,400
communication channel to talk to the

1451
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,920
browser vendor and for the browser

1452
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,000
vendor it becomes a point

1453
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,079
of control in which they can make sure

1454
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,520
that they have a reliable service

1455
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,359
that even if the ca doesn't have

1456
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,440
visibility into reliability the browser

1457
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,839
vendor because they developed the client

1458
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,160
can have a sense of well do i actually

1459
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:18,960
have a reliable connection

1460
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,520
part of the web pki also assumes to a

1461
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,760
degree that servers can talk to the ca

1462
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,599
now it's not guaranteed though a classic

1463
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,079
example of this is sort of ocsb

1464
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,920
stapling in order for ocsp stapling to

1465
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,280
work we assume that the server has to

1466
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,640
talk to the ca

1467
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,559
and in fact there is a preference for

1468
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,118
ocsp stapling because we assume the

1469
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,000
client

1470
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,319
can't talk effectively to the ca next

1471
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,319
slide

1472
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,839
this is somewhat of an

1473
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:47,760
oversimplification but

1474
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:50,160
with pkx the 2459 3280 5280

1475
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,760
design there's not really any strong

1476
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,680
assumptions whatsoever

1477
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,119
now the client and the server we presume

1478
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,640
that they have a path for exchanging

1479
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,599
messages but everything else

1480
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,319
is fair game whether it's one ca or many

1481
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,400
cas

1482
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,440
it's a bit of an unreliable connectivity

1483
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,760
now

1484
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,599
this is important because in order for

1485
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,240
many of the security guarantees to work

1486
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,440
you actually have to figure out what is

1487
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,439
the actual connectivity

1488
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,440
so next slide so an example of this

1489
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,720
right the server can't talk to external

1490
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,720
entities the client

1491
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,879
can't talk to external entities so you

1492
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,078
have no way to actually fetch or deliver

1493
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,359
revocation data

1494
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,200
if the client and the server are the

1495
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:28,558
only two parties that can talk and you

1496
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,078
have a certificate chain

1497
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,839
there's no way to get that so what's

1498
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,760
your solution well

1499
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:35,839
a solution is short-lived certificates

1500
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,760
you don't have to worry about revocation

1501
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,960
now you just let the lifetime of the

1502
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,599
certificate be

1503
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,400
what it is downside of that is now this

1504
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,720
introduces

1505
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,920
into your pki and your protocol design

1506
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,439
you have to think about certificate

1507
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,200
lifecycle management

1508
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,200
you also have to think now about how

1509
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,879
third-party cas in that relationship

1510
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,200
works if your clients

1511
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,799
don't have a way to change what cas they

1512
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,040
trust and your servers don't have a way

1513
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,280
to change what cas they trust

1514
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,279
it increases your risk model of do you

1515
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,799
put a third party in on that

1516
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,720
who you might decide to not trust

1517
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,440
trustworthy is it better to bring it

1518
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,439
in-house

1519
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,359
another example right is clients can't

1520
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,000
talk to external entities but the server

1521
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,558
can

1522
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,480
so ocsp stapling is viable there's a

1523
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,000
problem though with assuming that ocsp

1524
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,960
stapling is viable

1525
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,319
which is if the client built or verified

1526
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,160
certificate path

1527
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,400
is different than what the server sent

1528
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,879
then those ocsp responses the server

1529
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,520
sent

1530
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,960
aren't helpful and in order to solve

1531
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,960
this problem you need strict

1532
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,200
requirements on how certification

1533
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,640
paths are built so that your client and

1534
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,200
your server can agree on

1535
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,960
this is the right path this means to a

1536
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,799
degree that you need to understand what

1537
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,799
your clients trust anchors are

1538
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,839
or have a way to communicate that to the

1539
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,319
server so that you can find that mutual

1540
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:50,160
problem um

1541
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:52,160
i added this to the slide and i realized

1542
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,440
there was a discussion going on within

1543
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,680
emu right now

1544
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,200
that was part of what prompted this um

1545
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,118
but epls

1546
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,799
is this example right where you're

1547
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,319
bringing a client onto the network they

1548
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,319
don't have connectivity

1549
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,920
and you need to bring them up and this

1550
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,640
creates designs for you

1551
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,559
design challenges for your pki when your

1552
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,920
client can't talk to the network

1553
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,440
a real world example of this not trying

1554
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,000
to promote google products but

1555
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,880
when early chromebooks were released and

1556
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,359
they had a

1557
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,480
uh cellular modem in this this is the

1558
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:24,078
cr50s

1559
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,760
the problem with that is in order to use

1560
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:26,799
that cellular modem you need to activate

1561
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,799
the cellular remote

1562
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,000
so you'd go to a cellular provider in

1563
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:33,200
this case verisign

1564
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,799
or sorry verizon's website and you would

1565
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,558
activate your cr-50 and you would have

1566
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:39,040
cellular connectivity

1567
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,559
there's one problem with this verizon

1568
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,279
only allowed connectivity to their

1569
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,440
servers

1570
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,839
they forgot to allow connectivity to

1571
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,079
symantec's ocsp servers

1572
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,640
and so chromebooks would fail to connect

1573
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,400
and fail to be able to activate

1574
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,920
their cellular connection because they

1575
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,160
had no ability to fetch

1576
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,000
the revocation data and for a brief

1577
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,879
window this was a hard failure

1578
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,240
on chromebooks and so create at first

1579
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,839
slow connections where it would sit

1580
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,240
around for 60 seconds

1581
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,400
spinning and then also potentially hard

1582
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,319
fail these are terrible user experiences

1583
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,200
when you just want to use a device

1584
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:14,799
and this affects your pki design because

1585
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,279
these constraints

1586
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,799
change how you design your your protocol

1587
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,640
your pki

1588
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:24,880
um next slide another thing

1589
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,040
that is not entirely obvious is thinking

1590
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:30,319
about the naming scheme

1591
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:32,160
and so i mentioned the web pki started

1592
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,799
out with this idea of show it all to the

1593
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,040
users

1594
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:37,040
this naming scheme really leaned heavily

1595
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,520
on the idea of civil legal names

1596
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:40,160
with the idea being that rsa would

1597
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,960
verify

1598
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,040
the name for some value of verify or

1599
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,440
whoever had the rsa license

1600
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,880
uh would verify and that these would all

1601
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,240
be trustworthy so there weren't really

1602
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,319
rules on verification

1603
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,520
with pkx there was a strong interest and

1604
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,000
how do we build something for the

1605
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,520
internet

1606
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,160
right dns names um but also with

1607
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,759
the legacy x509v1 there was the globally

1608
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,799
unique name the distinguished name

1609
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,599
it's distinguished however naming is not

1610
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,400
so simple

1611
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,960
i know i'm preaching to the choir here

1612
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,160
dns of course has many zones and can

1613
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,200
involve many different naming

1614
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,879
authorities

1615
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,640
you have to decide how do you reflect

1616
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,040
that is that something that should be

1617
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,680
reflected in the pki

1618
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,079
is it you know there is a model of pki

1619
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,319
for

1620
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,160
every dns zone split there is a

1621
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,240
potential new sub ca

1622
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,000
that can allow delegation and control

1623
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,399
just within that namespace

1624
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,040
if you look at say the early drafts of

1625
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,839
tim

1626
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,880
there was a very strong coupling of

1627
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:39,200
restricting those organizational

1628
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,599
notaries to a very specific global name

1629
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:45,040
space which is the organization but then

1630
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,359
allowing them free reign within that

1631
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,319
so another way to think about like

1632
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:52,000
looking at the

1633
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:52,480
dns um the web pki was a global naming

1634
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,920
scheme

1635
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,839
you didn't have to work with the

1636
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,559
coordination of any of the zones

1637
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:59,599
any ca could issue for any domain name

1638
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:03,200
on the internet

1639
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:06,319
that is wonderful and terrifying

1640
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,078
so uh you can see some of these but also

1641
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,720
you have to think about how it means

1642
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,440
for services and protocols so i

1643
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,480
mentioned here

1644
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,119
you know uh should an hp server on port

1645
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,400
80

1646
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,960
be able to obtain a

1647
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,799
certificate for your smtp server just

1648
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,240
because i control the web server doesn't

1649
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,720
necessarily mean i am

1650
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,439
in control or authoritative for the smtp

1651
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,359
server

1652
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,359
and if i can obtain a certificate can i

1653
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,000
potentially spoof that connection

1654
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,119
and so srv names could help here that is

1655
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,880
certainly one option

1656
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,640
another option you could put it all in

1657
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,280
dns name you could use extended key

1658
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,960
usages that have semantic name

1659
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,559
these are the challenges of the pki

1660
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,079
design space because there's no

1661
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:50,799
right no inherently right or wrong way

1662
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,240
the answer is it depends unfortunately

1663
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:56,160
you can do all of this with the

1664
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:59,439
tools the rfc provides next slide

1665
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,200
excuse me an element of this

1666
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,480
is whether or not the names are stable

1667
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,480
or do they change

1668
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,000
uh when rsa originally started this

1669
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,200
certificates were two years that was in

1670
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,440
the contract

1671
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,399
uh and then with pam of course it was

1672
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,040
able to bring it down

1673
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,440
even shorter we can get one-year certs

1674
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,079
uh

1675
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,640
the web pk took a very different turn

1676
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:20,000
started off as roughly one year certs

1677
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:22,160
because that's when organizational

1678
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,559
information could be verified

1679
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,359
um and both between the combination of

1680
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,760
domain names

1681
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,200
and in the combination the the quest to

1682
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,319
provide ever cheaper services

1683
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,799
certificates start getting

1684
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:33,520
longer and by the time the cab forum

1685
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:35,200
came about

1686
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,440
and adopted the baseline requirements

1687
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:39,839
certificates there were some cas issuing

1688
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,760
10-year certificates for a domain name

1689
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,279
um i assure you domain names don't

1690
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,640
usually last for 10 years

1691
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,280
they can not usually

1692
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:50,400
when that happened that took a number of

1693
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,720
years to get back

1694
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,839
sorry one second i'm gonna pause and

1695
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,839
have a drink here

1696
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,599
um so i mentioned a little here that

1697
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:04,160
domain names can change

1698
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:06,240
um more frequently than annually we

1699
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,720
can't just assume a one-year cert

1700
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,439
research here is like bygone ssl that

1701
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,558
looked at how

1702
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,880
certificates changed

1703
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,680
sorry certificates did not change were

1704
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,440
not revoked

1705
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,359
even though control of the domain name

1706
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:20,960
or where the domain pointed

1707
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:23,279
was changed and so this creates new

1708
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:25,520
security risks

1709
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,960
so as i mentioned earlier you know the

1710
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:30,079
web pki the netscape

1711
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,839
shipped that became the web pki of today

1712
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,200
really was just a quick hack the

1713
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,680
assumption here was

1714
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,520
get it to market fix it in post there

1715
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:41,440
was strong confidence that ipsec would

1716
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,440
replace all this as with dns sec

1717
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,960
and this would just be a short thing

1718
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,640
excuse me sorry

1719
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,280
um and of course this this last bit of

1720
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,720
our names unambiguously interoperably

1721
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,480
machine parcel

1722
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:02,558
domain names turn out not to be as clear

1723
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,640
because you have specifications like rfc

1724
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,760
5280 talking about the preferred name

1725
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,440
syntax

1726
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,119
and then you have the running code that

1727
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,520
allows a lot more than that

1728
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,400
to hit the wire and actually be resolved

1729
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,920
the wire

1730
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,520
the canonical example of this is

1731
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,200
underscores

1732
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,359
which a number of products allow to be

1733
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,640
passed on the wire and are resolvable

1734
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,880
even though that's not the preferred

1735
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,960
name syntax so are those representable

1736
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,520
in certificates

1737
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,200
and of course urls are a special pain

1738
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,119
point for i think everyone involved and

1739
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,118
i'm not trying to open new wounds

1740
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,799
other than to say that it's not as

1741
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,880
unambiguously parsable

1742
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,240
because the real world gets in the way

1743
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,079
and when users write

1744
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:43,598
urls they don't always write them to

1745
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:46,079
spec because users are people too

1746
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,799
so another problem next slide to think

1747
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:51,520
about is who can issue certificates

1748
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:53,680
next slide exactly so every zone can be

1749
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:55,680
independently managed in dns sect which

1750
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,038
is fantastic

1751
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,720
except for the fact that in order for

1752
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,280
dns to really

1753
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,759
achieve the security you want arizona

1754
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:05,920
has to be practically managed

1755
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,839
so there's ecosystem costs there but it

1756
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,240
also provides a lot of flexibility in

1757
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:13,839
issuance because you can control what is

1758
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,118
your space where pki there's a set of ca

1759
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:19,920
they can issue for any domain

1760
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,839
downside every ca can issue for every

1761
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,440
domain

1762
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:25,200
now i mentioned this because there is

1763
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,440
some assumptions that are baked into a

1764
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,839
lot of the web pki security models

1765
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,520
with the assumption that okay every ca

1766
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,599
can issue for every domain

1767
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,520
but that's maybe not the end of the

1768
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,559
world because any client using one of

1769
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,079
these certificates

1770
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:42,319
will also check dns and so yes a ca

1771
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,039
could mis-issue a certificate for

1772
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:46,640
say google.com but then an attacker

1773
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,839
would also need to

1774
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:51,279
be on path be in the middle i'm not

1775
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,960
going to try to solve that

1776
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:58,559
discussion um other than to know that uh

1777
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:00,240
the the threat model from cas being able

1778
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,160
to do that global issuance

1779
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,598
is slightly tempered by the fact that

1780
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,319
clients can change how

1781
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,240
dns how they do their dns resolutions or

1782
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:12,558
potentially their ip connectivity

1783
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:15,919
will bgp second dns sex save us maybe

1784
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:18,160
p kicks is a very robust model it allows

1785
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,440
the federation of all these pkis to

1786
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,160
match from the bridge

1787
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,160
and all of these wonderful techniques so

1788
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,598
that you can be very selective and you

1789
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,200
unfortunately can get the lawyers

1790
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,000
involved and figure out how all this

1791
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,000
works

1792
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,520
the downside of course is in practice

1793
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,520
everyone ends up federating with

1794
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:35,759
everyone and you have no idea who you're

1795
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,119
trusting and why you're trusting them

1796
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,880
and this is practically worked out in

1797
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:42,880
the web pca so next slides

1798
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,039
uh another one is who's the policy

1799
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,680
authority who decides who writes the

1800
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,000
rules

1801
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:49,200
um this is something that i think causes

1802
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,200
people the most pain

1803
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,598
when thinking about what pki is internet

1804
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,720
pki because why should browser set the

1805
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:58,000
rules

1806
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:01,118
and this is because it is a to a degree

1807
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,960
browser pki for better for worse so in

1808
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,559
order to achieve the security and

1809
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,480
interoperability you need

1810
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:08,559
you need folks to agree and this is

1811
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,480
where sdos can help

1812
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,400
but i think we know that the ietf is a

1813
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,200
bit shy around policy and for good

1814
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,960
reason

1815
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,480
so you need a policy authority and i'm

1816
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,440
not trying to say that it can't be an

1817
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,039
sdo

1818
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,559
just that in general it's not an sdo

1819
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,240
because you need to be able to say that

1820
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,599
x is not secure

1821
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,479
uh and if i say x is not secure and you

1822
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:30,480
disagree

1823
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,839
i'm missing out on security and of

1824
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:36,160
course if i say

1825
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:38,000
um if i can't say that x is here

1826
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,440
then we don't have interoperability so

1827
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,160
there's there's some issues here

1828
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,079
to resolve that a policy authority can

1829
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,000
help cut through in answering whether or

1830
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:47,839
not x is secure or not

1831
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,520
or be able to work through with multiple

1832
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,720
participants

1833
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,839
i'm going to argue that every pki needs

1834
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:55,839
a new policy

1835
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:57,599
and every time you have a new policy you

1836
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,640
really want a new pki

1837
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,039
and so that's a bit contrary to the what

1838
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,078
is

1839
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,000
possible within rsc 5280 because you

1840
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,079
have tools like certificate policies

1841
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,599
always that you can use to express how

1842
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,440
things are issued

1843
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,880
unfortunately this is heavily dependent

1844
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,280
on the

1845
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,880
assumption of local policy and we want

1846
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,760
to get something that just works out of

1847
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,839
the box

1848
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,839
can't have a bunch of of these local

1849
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,038
policies and you don't have the ability

1850
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,960
to discover say

1851
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,280
policy mappings in a very easy and

1852
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,359
reliable way

1853
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,960
and you can't help network effects

1854
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:32,000
because network effects will always

1855
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,760
penalize the first

1856
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,920
mover if you are going to break

1857
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,240
something you're in trouble

1858
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,839
and equally if everyone else is breaking

1859
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,598
something you benefit from

1860
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:43,279
breaking last because they will have

1861
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,039
solved all the problems for you

1862
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,880
we see this play out in browsers all the

1863
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,760
time when it comes to like deprecating

1864
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,839
features

1865
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,520
so the policy authority there is someone

1866
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:54,240
who can answer these questions

1867
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:54,880
but that is itself a whole loaded

1868
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,000
question

1869
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,079
and as with any sort of matter of policy

1870
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,280
but to something that if you want a pki

1871
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,920
that works out of the box

1872
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,119
on the internet between multiple vendors

1873
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,400
you have to figure out

1874
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,640
how are you going to make those

1875
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,760
decisions and get people to agree

1876
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,118
and how are you going to handle when

1877
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:15,359
things disagree next slide

1878
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,559
so a little bit is also to talk about

1879
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:19,359
the certificate profile

1880
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,000
and i don't strictly mean the extensions

1881
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,240
um

1882
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,680
what i mean here uh and i meant to make

1883
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,479
mention here of you know protocol

1884
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,000
maintenance

1885
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,079
is unfortunately when everything is

1886
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:30,319
extensible nothing ends up being

1887
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,319
extensible because it's an overwhelming

1888
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:35,520
mess riddled with bugs

1889
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:36,319
and pkix has unfortunately because of

1890
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,520
its history

1891
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,720
because of this co-evolution of web pki

1892
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,960
predating pkix pci you know

1893
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,200
being a part of the operating system

1894
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,599
well before pkx had finished its first

1895
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,720
re

1896
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:52,400
or finished its final draft created

1897
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,680
issues where you have incompatible

1898
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,920
implementations

1899
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,279
um you know again thinking about a

1900
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,280
classic example of this

1901
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,039
is internet explorer not supporting

1902
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,680
basic constraints

1903
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,079
like that's kind of a major thing that

1904
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,440
was an

1905
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:10,240
oops are bad but equally firefox

1906
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,680
you know netscape that became firefox

1907
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,439
never supported the authority

1908
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,880
information access field

1909
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:19,279
even though that's also part of rsc 5280

1910
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,600
and so the idea here is that you have to

1911
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,600
use rfc 5280 as a starting point

1912
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,600
but then you have to rip everything else

1913
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,120
out that you don't need

1914
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,279
otherwise you will not achieve the

1915
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:32,000
interoperability that you're wanting for

1916
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,400
so i i've listed a few of these examples

1917
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,399
here

1918
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:36,238
i talked a little bit revocation versus

1919
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:38,238
expiration well that depends

1920
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,158
what's the connectivity on your clients

1921
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,238
will depend on whether you lean on

1922
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,358
something like ocsp or crl

1923
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,439
or whether you have to lean on

1924
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,319
short-lived certificates you have to

1925
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,000
decide acceptable crl ocsp sizes

1926
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,839
which are going to be gated on client

1927
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,238
bandwidth

1928
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:55,679
if you're using these external lookups

1929
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:57,040
you have to figure out what protocols

1930
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,679
you're going to support

1931
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,278
but equally say in a web browser

1932
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,640
external lookups have privacy

1933
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,600
consequences that might not be

1934
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,359
appropriate

1935
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,440
where in another protocol it might be

1936
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:08,880
perfectly reasonable so there's a lot of

1937
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,439
challenges here

1938
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,600
um i think though to highlight that it's

1939
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,759
not just extensions

1940
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,000
i mentioned you know privacy enhanced

1941
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,960
mail took a very simple flat pki

1942
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,719
structure

1943
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,839
you know you had the ipra you had the

1944
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,359
pcas so you had this sense of well okay

1945
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,359
i only have a few layers

1946
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,759
you can look at netscape with their the

1947
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:33,120
first version of ssl that they released

1948
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:35,520
which had no chains whatsoever

1949
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,158
the length and complexity of your pki

1950
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,920
graph is

1951
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,439
very coupled with how you're going to

1952
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,920
manage naming authority

1953
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:43,198
is everyone independent or is there some

1954
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:45,199
central authority

1955
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:46,719
is there some shared global name space

1956
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,559
like the web pki

1957
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,399
this affects a lot of the depth and a

1958
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,000
lot of the complexity

1959
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:56,080
but then also there are other issues um

1960
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,679
let's encrypt recently published a blog

1961
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,360
post talking about how their

1962
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:01,679
certificates are going to stop working

1963
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,199
on older android devices

1964
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,320
beginning in late next year september i

1965
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,719
believe

1966
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:10,000
and this is again something to think

1967
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,280
about because

1968
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,080
the reason that they're in this

1969
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,040
situation is they don't have a way from

1970
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,120
a path

1971
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:18,320
a set of trust anchors that are on those

1972
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,400
older devices

1973
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,920
to their current certificates and i

1974
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,599
don't know whether they're not

1975
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,280
able to obtain a cross certificate from

1976
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,640
another ca or

1977
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,759
if they're not wanting to but this

1978
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,840
creates implications for

1979
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,159
interoperability when you think about

1980
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,360
this

1981
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:37,040
and yes it's terrifying and i i don't

1982
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,920
know how much more i can say about that

1983
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,159
but this

1984
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,840
this affects your ppi profile and design

1985
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:43,759
because you have to think how

1986
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,600
how will you change the set of ca's that

1987
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,520
you trust over time

1988
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,640
between devices how will you manage that

1989
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,120
migration

1990
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,120
if you don't allow cross signing that

1991
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,800
makes it much harder but if you do allow

1992
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,719
cross sighting that adds a host of

1993
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,440
complexity to your security and threat

1994
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,120
model

1995
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,120
because you allow the introduction of

1996
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,640
entities that you may not have vetted

1997
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:04,719
and that may not be part of your threat

1998
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,960
model picks

1999
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,560
allows for both scenarios it doesn't

2000
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,679
really tell you which is the right or

2001
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,360
wrong way

2002
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:14,320
and that's both its strength and its

2003
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,480
curse next slide

2004
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,440
uh so yeah apparently i just kind of

2005
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,639
heard

2006
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,040
most of this so i would probably show

2007
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,600
you the next next slide um

2008
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,280
i i mentioned in the case of like etls

2009
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,719
and this is also true in the case of

2010
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,080
mutual tls

2011
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,320
that you have to think about how the

2012
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:32,159
certificate paths are going to be built

2013
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,400
and whether what the client builds is

2014
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:37,120
going to be what the server agrees on

2015
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,559
recall that in that x519v1 the

2016
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,159
assumption here was that

2017
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,679
the directory would be the source of

2018
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,199
truth everyone would always have

2019
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,640
connectivity to the directory or at

2020
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:45,519
least enough connectivity that they

2021
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,520
needed

2022
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,040
and that you could discover the paths

2023
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,520
through the directory before

2024
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,960
and reverse and so you could build a

2025
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,800
path that you would be sure that your

2026
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,719
peer would accept

2027
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,159
fortunately or unfortunately depending

2028
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:59,360
on your take the directory never

2029
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:02,000
materialized

2030
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:03,120
and we had a lot of alternatives that um

2031
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,440
ldap is certainly an

2032
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,360
option but i i'm happy to tell you most

2033
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,639
web browsers do not implement ldap and

2034
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,320
all of its complexity

2035
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,520
so it's not an option for say the web

2036
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,040
pki it might be an option for your pki

2037
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,440
it depends on what you're doing if

2038
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,360
you're doing it over ldap probably

2039
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,839
if you're not building an ldap client

2040
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:24,239
probably not

2041
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,880
um so you have to work things oh

2042
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:27,839
sorry looks like we jumped uh extra few

2043
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,520
extra slides so yes

2044
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:33,920
office sorry i looked away yes

2045
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,080
um so one of the important decisions

2046
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,920
sorry you can go ahead next slide uh

2047
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,239
slide 34.

2048
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,159
all right we're on the same page uh

2049
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:43,199
another element to the design of pki

2050
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,360
you have to think about do you like

2051
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,639
check boxes or do you like descriptions

2052
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,759
uh check boxes iso 17021

2053
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,880
iso 17065 they have good they give you

2054
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:53,920
interoperability they give you

2055
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,760
compliance testing

2056
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,040
they're terrible for security testing

2057
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,760
because you have to list

2058
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,960
everything bad as a negative test and

2059
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,719
frankly

2060
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,960
listing everything that can go wrong is

2061
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,120
a very time consuming process

2062
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,520
you can go for a descriptive type of

2063
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,760
approach to audits isa 3000

2064
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,600
is certainly an approach not the only

2065
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,840
approach these are examples

2066
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,199
where you you have the ca describe the

2067
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,880
system how it works

2068
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,639
how it's designed how they meet your

2069
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,719
requirements downside

2070
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,239
you have to make a judgment on how well

2071
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,400
they meet your requirements

2072
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:27,919
based on that report and it's really bad

2073
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,559
for interoperability and compliance

2074
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,920
testing

2075
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,440
because just because something sounds

2076
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,960
good doesn't mean it'll actually lead to

2077
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,960
good results

2078
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,040
but the answer here for what's the right

2079
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,719
way it's going to depend on what you're

2080
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,519
trying to do

2081
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,280
also with audit next slide you have a

2082
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,760
whole host of questions

2083
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,840
this is the auditing practice in general

2084
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,360
if if you're trying to certify something

2085
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,320
as compliant certifying something as

2086
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,759
interoperability

2087
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,920
everyone has to go through this and

2088
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,760
think about this even if you are going

2089
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,679
to run the pki yourself

2090
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,520
and every other vendor is going to trust

2091
01:13:57,679 --> 01:14:01,120
you to do that you're probably going to

2092
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,120
have audits because they're going to

2093
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,719
want to know why should they trust you

2094
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:07,280
so these are still questions you have to

2095
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:09,199
work through which is talking about

2096
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,360
what are the criteria who decides the

2097
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:14,480
criteria who performs the audits

2098
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,440
who decides who performs the audits how

2099
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,879
do you know

2100
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,960
who's performing the audits is good

2101
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,000
enough to perform audits it's turtles

2102
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,760
all the way down

2103
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,760
it's trust all the way down and yes it

2104
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,000
ties to a lot of civil

2105
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,400
legal obligations depending on how

2106
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,560
you're doing it if you're doing an iso

2107
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,519
17065

2108
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,320
type system you might not have a legal

2109
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:36,239
backing to do if you're doing isa e3 000

2110
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,440
you might have international treaties

2111
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:41,280
that can help you

2112
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:43,599
it really depends next slide

2113
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:44,800
so i'm trying to rush through and be

2114
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,239
sensitive to time

2115
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:51,600
um so conclusions last slide

2116
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:55,040
uh one more slide 37 yeah there we go

2117
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:56,480
um where the reason for this is to try

2118
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,760
to highlight there isn't a single

2119
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,239
internet pki

2120
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,600
and that there really can't be just one

2121
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,360
internet pki

2122
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,800
because different security protocols are

2123
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,559
going to require different needs we

2124
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,679
don't really think of one cipher suite

2125
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,120
to rule them all

2126
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,199
and while we use ssl tls ubiquitously

2127
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,360
our needs our capabilities for our

2128
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:17,280
clients from the small end devices to

2129
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:18,159
our like our watches to our high-end

2130
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:21,199
devices

2131
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,440
are vastly different and our pki design

2132
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:26,239
fits into the security guarantees

2133
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,239
so rfc 5280 gives you a framework i'm

2134
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,159
very supportive of it i love it

2135
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:32,080
but it's the tools to build a car a pool

2136
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,000
or a house and you have to make sure you

2137
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,600
don't build a floating rv

2138
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,920
uh you can do that but you shouldn't

2139
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,080
um it is possible to build interoperable

2140
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:45,280
pkis that work out of the box

2141
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:47,280
it's a lot of work the web pki has taken

2142
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,719
tremendous amount of effort and each of

2143
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,639
these questions are still questions that

2144
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,719
the wood pki is grappling with

2145
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:55,040
it also means that the answers may not

2146
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,520
be what you need for your use case

2147
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,640
and in fact more often than not are not

2148
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:02,080
which is why i say

2149
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:04,400
don't use the webpeak because

2150
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,239
when there are these differences you

2151
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,599
potentially get broken and this creates

2152
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,519
conflict it creates conflict and

2153
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,159
security policy and creates

2154
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,600
conflict in i hate breaking things

2155
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,879
everyone hates breaking things

2156
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,199
and these are things we should try to

2157
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,840
avoid when you start thinking about a

2158
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,280
pki

2159
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,040
you really need to ensure that every

2160
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,120
single bite is critically necessary you

2161
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,880
can't leave anything under specified

2162
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,159
because every area that is left for

2163
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:28,880
extensibility

2164
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:29,920
has turned out in almost every pki to be

2165
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:33,199
a

2166
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,719
pain point that bites us in the end

2167
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:36,400
maybe that's not as important if you're

2168
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,320
doing a small enterprise pki

2169
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,400
or just a locally enterprise pki where

2170
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,199
you manage same million devices

2171
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,519
but when you think about

2172
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,559
interoperability we have to think of pki

2173
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,640
like protocols

2174
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,960
and realize that there's not a one size

2175
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,719
fits all

2176
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,440
and when you're doing protocol designs

2177
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,159
this is i would argue a mistake of ssl

2178
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,199
tls

2179
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:58,879
a mistake netscape's assumption that has

2180
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:01,199
lingered on with this consider

2181
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,640
supporting multiple pkis

2182
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,199
s mime is good at this right you can

2183
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,760
have multiple signatures ssl tls is

2184
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:07,440
awful

2185
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
uh at this because you have the

2186
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:12,639
certificate p

2187
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:15,040
kicks somewhat imagined the idea

2188
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,239
that you could branch the pkis at the

2189
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,719
issuer certificate

2190
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:20,480
right the client can build a different

2191
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,560
path to a local trust anchor than what

2192
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,959
the server provided

2193
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,320
and for many clients that's what they do

2194
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,239
but there's not a way to provide

2195
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:29,920
different certificates themselves

2196
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,839
that meet different policies in a way

2197
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,239
that's interoperable i'm

2198
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,400
excited still for the certificate frame

2199
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,239
at like in http 2 layer to allow this

2200
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,960
provision of multiple certificates

2201
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:43,120
but as you think about protocol designs

2202
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,800
designed for multiple pkis

2203
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,480
because different vendors even if

2204
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,560
they're using the same protocol

2205
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,639
over the same port will have different

2206
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,800
needs thinking again like the set-top

2207
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,840
box versus web browser

2208
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:57,440
so i realized that was a little bit of a

2209
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:58,560
disconnected talk i realized there's

2210
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:00,159
certainly history

2211
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,159
that a number of people were

2212
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:04,080
participating in

2213
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,480
but i'm hoping this gives an insight

2214
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,120
into sort of what the web pki

2215
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,000
is and why it may not be appropriate for

2216
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:13,199
the use case

2217
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,040
or if you want a pki um what the

2218
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,799
challenges are to actually get there and

2219
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,519
try to replicate the

2220
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,040
success of an out of the box pki that

2221
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:23,840
just works

2222
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,840
i will shut up

2223
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,080
yes so thank you very much ryan that was

2224
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,480
a

2225
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:32,640
very fun talk and and hopefully in

2226
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,360
london in some parts i know we had a

2227
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,560
good bit of

2228
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:38,320
chat in the jabber about the specifics

2229
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,239
of the history and

2230
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,840
uh histories of course always hard to

2231
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:43,839
get right especially if you were not

2232
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,760
there when it happened

2233
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,120
so i think we may have extracted a

2234
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,719
promise from phil

2235
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:52,960
to try and produce a version of the pki

2236
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:54,960
history which will be very interesting

2237
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,080
to many of us i don't know if he wants

2238
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,520
to

2239
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,960
try and give some key points right now

2240
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,560
or if we should just wait to do that

2241
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:04,159
later

2242
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:07,280
because i will try to focus

2243
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:09,280
my enthusiasm i guess on sort of the

2244
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:11,360
last part of the talk about

2245
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,360
what the operational needs for for

2246
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,080
building pki are and especially even on

2247
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:17,120
this last

2248
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,679
slide um that you know there's there's

2249
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,760
not a

2250
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:22,080
single pki and that you may need to do

2251
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,080
uh

2252
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,519
your own thing if your needs are

2253
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:28,000
different from those of the webp

2254
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:29,120
guy so i'm very happy that you were able

2255
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,440
to

2256
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,719
sort of make that point and really

2257
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,159
hammer it home

2258
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:39,600
throughout with the insights about

2259
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:42,400
the web eki and other things as well

2260
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,320
so i think we can open up the queue for

2261
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,040
questions and comments and corrections i

2262
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,400
know

2263
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,400
you had asked at the start for

2264
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,719
corrections as appropriate

2265
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,960
so i think we have phil and q please go

2266
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,960
ahead

2267
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:07,600
okay i'm i'm on then yeah uh i

2268
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:09,440
i i won't go into the history i can't

2269
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,040
say that i don't agree with

2270
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,879
pretty much all of what was said on

2271
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:14,880
history

2272
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,120
i think that one thing that's critical

2273
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:20,000
to remember is that

2274
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,400
in 19 the reason that netscape 1 didn't

2275
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,880
have

2276
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:28,000
a change was that it took

2277
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,280
an appreciable number of seconds

2278
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,080
to connect up to a website with ssl in

2279
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,759
those

2280
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:39,440
days with the machines of the era

2281
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:41,040
and a lot of strengths that we have in

2282
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,919
physics

2283
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,320
have to do with the constraints that

2284
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,280
were

2285
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:51,519
present in the 1990s and also in the

2286
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:53,679
1970s when lauren confelder

2287
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,800
originally wrote his undergraduate

2288
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,800
thesis

2289
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:01,520
which is what physics is all based on

2290
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,560
and so it's not surprising it doesn't

2291
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,760
work very well i

2292
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:09,199
i i do endorse conclusion

2293
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:11,840
uh i mean certificates expire

2294
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,199
and that is not always what you want

2295
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,880
them to do

2296
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:16,239
it's particularly not something that you

2297
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,239
want

2298
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:23,360
to do in general

2299
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:25,040
uh it's not if you look at the design of

2300
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:28,080
the rpki

2301
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:31,360
um i mean

2302
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,239
trying to squeeze that into it it was

2303
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,360
nothing

2304
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,718
appropriate what you have there is a

2305
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:42,719
veggie star

2306
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:44,880
who is registering what of ikea dress

2307
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,639
that is something one of the few things

2308
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,440
that blockchain would have been useful

2309
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,159
for

2310
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:52,080
or rather take out the you know the

2311
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:55,280
silliness of blockchain and

2312
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:57,600
go back to your vlog but

2313
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:59,120
we've got this hammer and everything

2314
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:03,199
means that

2315
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,199
the eyes and it's not useless

2316
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,638
and i don't look again

2317
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,920
thank you uh and we do look forward to

2318
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:25,840
to hearing

2319
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:25,840
the true history

2320
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:33,760
uh so yes david please go ahead

2321
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,960
thank you i just wanted to like

2322
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:39,040
sincerely

2323
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:40,639
thank ryan for this talk i personally

2324
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,880
think that we don't have enough like

2325
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,280
historical talks at ietf and it's kind

2326
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,639
of

2327
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:46,400
you know we're all caught in the moment

2328
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,920
of what's the next best thing or

2329
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,440
next thing we're building and having

2330
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,239
kind of that context is really helpful

2331
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,199
so honestly

2332
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:53,678
thank you i learned a huge amount today

2333
01:22:53,199 --> 01:23:07,839
so

2334
01:22:53,679 --> 01:23:07,840
thanks that's it

2335
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,159
all right uh david i think you have to

2336
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,719
manually take yourself

2337
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:15,360
out of the queue i don't believe i have

2338
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,840
an option

2339
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,599
to do that for you yeah and you actually

2340
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,159
you can if you click the hand but i can

2341
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,159
do it as well

2342
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,159
okay uh so phil i don't know if you're

2343
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,239
still

2344
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:36,480
intending to be sending audio video

2345
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:36,480
but fraser is next in the queue

2346
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,960
thank you for your presentation just

2347
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,760
wonder if you could briefly

2348
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,360
talk to the topic of greece just in the

2349
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,840
final slide you say it's hard to apply

2350
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:49,839
to pkis could you elaborate

2351
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,840
all right how are you ascending yes um

2352
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,159
the reason why i say this

2353
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,600
is greece is hard because you need the

2354
01:23:56,159 --> 01:24:01,199
cooperation

2355
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,880
of the ca and so depending on your model

2356
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,719
you may not be able to ease decrease

2357
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,639
things now when you grease things

2358
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:08,080
you need someone to get a certificate

2359
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:09,440
and you need them to send that

2360
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,719
certificate to someone else

2361
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,879
and so this is a three-party

2362
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,280
coordination problem that makes it very

2363
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:18,560
hard to add this this grease in

2364
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:20,000
and also makes it hard to randomize

2365
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,960
a lot of this because if you start

2366
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,719
adding say extensions to make sure that

2367
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:28,639
your extensibility

2368
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,840
maintains and using tls as an example

2369
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,679
because you can only send one

2370
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,080
certificate you sort of get an all or

2371
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:34,560
nothing

2372
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:36,400
shot if that certificate fails you've

2373
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,239
now broken the protocol for your peers

2374
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,799
and you have to get another certificate

2375
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,839
and you may not know you broke them it's

2376
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,679
a little bit easier

2377
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,840
saying something with s mine where you

2378
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,239
could add a regular certificate and a

2379
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,000
greased

2380
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:50,080
certificate and hope you sort of get it

2381
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,639
the right results

2382
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:54,159
but because it requires the coordination

2383
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,000
of multiple parties and whether you're

2384
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:58,000
thinking of cross certificates

2385
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,520
and sort of that the classic pkix model

2386
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,239
where you're thinking in the very narrow

2387
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,480
case

2388
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,919
uh whether it be web pki or say you need

2389
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:06,879
a localized

2390
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,880
part um the multi-party coordination

2391
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,440
makes it hard for a single party

2392
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,280
to say i want to grease things you need

2393
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,239
to say a ca that's willing to give you a

2394
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,840
greased cert

2395
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,280
a server that is willing to take the

2396
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,280
risk of the grease cert

2397
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,599
and you need clients who are willing to

2398
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,120
allow grease deserts to be issued

2399
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,960
depending on their compatibility and

2400
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,040
security needs so yes i

2401
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,520
apologize for not going into the greater

2402
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,519
one there

2403
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,080
great uh so i think the queue is showing

2404
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:43,120
us empty we have

2405
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:46,239
a number of people in the chat thanking

2406
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,480
um ryan as well for the talk so

2407
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:54,080
just i will echo that again thank you i

2408
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:56,400
enjoy the talk

2409
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,320
i guess room we have to switch slide

2410
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:01,759
decks in order to get to the

2411
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:08,080
uh the one remaining slide

2412
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:11,440
in uh shift slides

2413
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:15,760
which is of course the open mic so

2414
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:23,839
we've got a decent bit of time left

2415
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:23,840
the mic queue is open

2416
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,880
uh kirsty please go ahead

2417
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,440
hi um thanks for the interesting talks

2418
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,960
today i think they've been really good

2419
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,879
i just wondered if we could use this

2420
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,199
time to talk about the vulnerability

2421
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,000
disclosure policy that the ietf is

2422
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:45,919
or iesg is soon to publish um and any

2423
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,560
sort of time scales for

2424
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,360
uh revisions or um yeah if you could

2425
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,320
just speak to

2426
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:52,719
a bit about your future plans for it um

2427
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:55,120
because

2428
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,120
i think as roman said yesterday in the

2429
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,280
iesg there's there's work to do

2430
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,440
and kind of how to best harness the

2431
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,960
expertise that you have in itf to

2432
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,839
to make it the most effective it could

2433
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,840
be thank you

2434
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,360
great question uh i think what we're

2435
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,480
about to publish

2436
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,839
is is documenting the as

2437
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,879
is on the ground uh

2438
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:26,639
it makes no attempt really to change any

2439
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,840
behavior in the ietf other than adding

2440
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,719
really kind of the alias as folks have

2441
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,199
commented

2442
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,760
on the list uh and as you kind of well

2443
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:37,040
know

2444
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,120
what we're describing is pretty far from

2445
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:41,840
what best practice would be if you were

2446
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,440
a certainly kind of a product vendor or

2447
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,520
anyone dealing in this class of

2448
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:47,678
coordination

2449
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:50,159
we should be trying to optimize to make

2450
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,199
it as easy as possible to get those

2451
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:54,239
reports

2452
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:57,199
and providing as much uh

2453
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:57,839
you know support to those reports in

2454
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:59,839
working them

2455
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,000
you know triaging them and working them

2456
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,760
through the entire organization and

2457
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,040
the current process frankly doesn't do

2458
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,159
that uh i

2459
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:11,280
i think that to pivot uh

2460
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:12,320
what we do now to be a little closer to

2461
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,199
best practice

2462
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:16,400
uh it's going to require work on kind of

2463
01:28:15,199 --> 01:28:19,919
consensus building

2464
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:21,839
to to have to have and work uh

2465
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:23,840
work vulnerabilities in a you know i

2466
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,679
guess a more centralized way

2467
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,040
uh i think the other kind of component

2468
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,239
to that is we should probably eat a

2469
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:32,239
little bit of our own dog food we have

2470
01:28:29,239 --> 01:28:33,599
security.txt almost kind of published

2471
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,199
we should make sure when that's

2472
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,719
officially kind of published that that

2473
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:38,799
that's something we serve for

2474
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:41,199
kind of the itf so i think a lot of

2475
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,480
dimensions of that are on deck

2476
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:44,400
personally i think we're going to have

2477
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,799
to nibble at it you know a little bit at

2478
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,199
a

2479
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,040
a little bit at a time one of the other

2480
01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:50,960
best practice things we as the itf need

2481
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,600
to figure out we have appetite for

2482
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,440
is how much if at all we want to engage

2483
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,280
the implementation community to make

2484
01:28:55,440 --> 01:29:00,159
sure they are aware of

2485
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,759
the fixes we make to to our documents

2486
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:04,799
that address kind of security issues

2487
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:07,280
that they may they may be implementing

2488
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,080
so i guess we want to have a little bit

2489
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,120
of a follow-up

2490
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:13,120
question for that are these evolutions

2491
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:15,040
and improvements something that you plan

2492
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:16,000
to be driving or do you think there's a

2493
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,760
space

2494
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,080
for someone else to be sort of taking a

2495
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:21,440
lead in those conversations

2496
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,280
uh i mean i definitely think we're going

2497
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:24,799
to need a community-based approach i

2498
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,360
think one of the things that came

2499
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,400
out of the the feedback is do we have a

2500
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:30,159
reasonable place

2501
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,759
to talk about what that future would

2502
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,559
look like and i think it made a ton of

2503
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,880
sense uh

2504
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:39,840
to create a mailing list uh you know to

2505
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:39,840
have that conversation

2506
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:43,040
yeah thank you and i think that that's a

2507
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,960
really good approach

2508
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,560
to go forward to create a mailing list

2509
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,120
and start discussions because they

2510
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:53,840
wouldn't

2511
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:53,840
see it move forward thanks

2512
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:09,760
um hi uh so i think

2513
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,440
the have you considered so one of the

2514
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,920
things i do

2515
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:16,400
outside of the ietf is i work within the

2516
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:18,719
cv community as a cv board member

2517
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,719
um and you know one of the things that

2518
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,400
we're trying to do in cve is we're

2519
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,480
trying to

2520
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:26,080
recruit additional organizations that

2521
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:29,360
are cv numbering authorities

2522
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:32,639
organizations that are able to assign

2523
01:30:29,360 --> 01:30:34,960
on their own um cvids to

2524
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,400
you know to things that are vulnerable

2525
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,440
um

2526
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:41,280
has the iesg thought about maybe

2527
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:44,559
becoming a cve

2528
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:48,000
um numbering authority

2529
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:49,760
as part of the cve program you know

2530
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,760
this is an interesting use case that we

2531
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,159
haven't really explored too much within

2532
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:55,920
within cve but you could effectively

2533
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:59,519
issue cv ids against

2534
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:02,159
you know rfcs um and those could be

2535
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,280
you know referenced um you know by

2536
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:07,280
potential implementers

2537
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:09,120
uh yeah i mean that's certainly a kind

2538
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,280
of a good point we haven't talked about

2539
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:14,559
that in the isg but that's come back

2540
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:17,199
uh as you know as feedback that that's

2541
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:18,800
something the ietf can do i think that's

2542
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:19,440
great kind of fodder for how much

2543
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,159
appetite

2544
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:23,599
there is to do that uh you know in

2545
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,519
further kind of discussion

2546
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,360
i mean i would just say what we have now

2547
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,960
was not attempting again to be as

2548
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,480
ambitious as that and we would have to

2549
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,199
figure out quite a lot of workflow

2550
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:33,360
things

2551
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:34,638
to uh yeah to do that but i mean there's

2552
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,960
there's no reason why we couldn't

2553
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,120
i mean frankly kind of scoping on what

2554
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:41,679
we would hand that cvs out for

2555
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:43,280
and having confidence in how consistent

2556
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,719
we are about handing those out

2557
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,559
would be kind of key challenges i would

2558
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,520
see on deck if we were to head that way

2559
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,960
but yeah good point yeah and you know if

2560
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:52,480
there's interest in doing that i would

2561
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:56,840
be certainly willing to

2562
01:31:52,480 --> 01:32:00,320
help um however however i can

2563
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,320
thanks you're welcome

2564
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,280
okay phil back up

2565
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:13,199
hello can you hear me now yes

2566
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,480
yeah you're good okay so uh

2567
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:20,159
i just wanted to say um

2568
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:23,360
uh to so blockchain

2569
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:25,679
is currently the hot topic in trypto

2570
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:27,280
i would urge people to take a look at

2571
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:29,120
what's starting to come out of the

2572
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,000
threshold cryptography

2573
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,639
world uh there's just been a nist

2574
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:37,120
workshop

2575
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:39,679
on threshold cryptography and

2576
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,159
the next administration is going in the

2577
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,760
us

2578
01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:44,080
is going to be dealing with the

2579
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:47,199
consequences

2580
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,320
of the snowden breach and insider

2581
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:50,239
threats

2582
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:51,440
and a whole rack of other security

2583
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:54,559
issues

2584
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:56,480
for which threshold is the obvious

2585
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,600
technical solution

2586
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,559
so i've made a set of training videos to

2587
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,760
show you

2588
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,639
how threshold is working inside i'm

2589
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,679
afraid they're not

2590
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:09,360
up yet but i will edit them in the next

2591
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:12,000
few weeks and put them up

2592
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,799
to help people get up speed and those

2593
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,840
all be on

2594
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:18,480
youtube thanks

2595
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,040
thanks uh please do post the links to

2596
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,159
sag

2597
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:23,519
when they are i'm sure it will be an

2598
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:28,080
interesting topic for us and i

2599
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,080
agree that we should start using those

2600
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,840
technologies

2601
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:44,480
okay this is still the open mic but the

2602
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,519
q

2603
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:50,638
is showing up as empty so

2604
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:54,239
i will start the

2605
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:57,280
internal countdown for the last call

2606
01:33:54,239 --> 01:34:00,480
for open mic comments okay we have

2607
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,480
chris please go ahead

2608
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:05,678
i'll uh i'll voice what i commented in

2609
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:09,600
the

2610
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:13,040
uh jabber platform kind of uh seconding

2611
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,239
uh support for uh automatic ways to

2612
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:17,840
acquire

2613
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:20,638
uh vulnerabilities about

2614
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,040
i can picture a world in which i can

2615
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:22,560
mark

2616
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:25,840
tools that i have written as

2617
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:29,120
implementing or relying on specific rfcs

2618
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:31,440
and then automatically inherit cves or

2619
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,960
whatever vulnerability disclosures

2620
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:38,638
happen in a way that my tooling can

2621
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:40,239
help me manage i can even see a world in

2622
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:43,600
which

2623
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:46,718
systems like github or git lab

2624
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:48,960
provide this to people

2625
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,000
and obviously the implementation is far

2626
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,159
out of scope here

2627
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:57,920
but if we provide that in a

2628
01:34:54,159 --> 01:35:01,360
tool digestible way i think we have a

2629
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:06,000
have some opportunities here to

2630
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:06,000
improve security in a fairly sizable way

2631
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:10,239
yeah thanks for that feedback if we

2632
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,920
ultimately decide to go that way

2633
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:13,678
absolutely i mean exporting that in some

2634
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:16,239
machine consumable way and having that

2635
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,000
as metadata in the data tracker seemed

2636
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,919
like you know it seemed like obvious

2637
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,880
kind of ways to export that information

2638
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,800
for the community

2639
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,040
thanks yeah i think there'd have to be

2640
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:27,840
you know cvs that are directly

2641
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,040
specific flaws in the in the rfc or

2642
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,440
related to it

2643
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:33,040
or declare lack of clarity there's a lot

2644
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,000
of potential complexity but it's worth

2645
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:37,440
pursuing

2646
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,679
right it's certainly not simple um but

2647
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,839
there have been specific vulnerabilities

2648
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:45,840
in the rfcs itself and not just

2649
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:48,080
implementations thereof right yes

2650
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:48,080
so

2651
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:56,960
okay uh dkg i guess you're up

2652
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:58,960
thanks um i am more wary about the idea

2653
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,080
of assigning cves to rfcs

2654
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:04,320
uh i understand the impulse but uh

2655
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,920
i think most of the vulnerabilities that

2656
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,239
we're concerned about are either in a

2657
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,159
specific subsection of an rfc

2658
01:36:08,239 --> 01:36:11,519
which any given piece of software might

2659
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:13,599
or might not implement

2660
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,280
or they are about how certain rfcs are

2661
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:18,159
used in the world

2662
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:21,440
um in which case it's not clear uh

2663
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:23,759
whether your particular tool is going to

2664
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,040
tickle that particular problem or the

2665
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:26,800
problem is between

2666
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,199
between the intersection of two

2667
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:32,880
different rfcs right when you

2668
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:36,080
run http one over

2669
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,880
tls 1.0 what are the issues versus if

2670
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,480
you

2671
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,800
right i mean you know if you're doing

2672
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:44,159
this particular kind of dns lookup

2673
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,719
um while talking to xmpp services right

2674
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:46,080
i mean

2675
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:48,080
this is where some of the problems that

2676
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,559
we run into are and i don't see how we

2677
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,800
can

2678
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,560
adequately represent that in a way that

2679
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,199
a machine can consume it

2680
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,199
unfortunately

2681
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,199
uh chris did you jump in the queue to

2682
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:02,320
respond

2683
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:02,320
so please go ahead

2684
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,159
indeed i did the um

2685
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:09,839
i think this is a common problem with

2686
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:12,799
cbes um

2687
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,760
and is absolutely not unique to rfcs in

2688
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,360
any way

2689
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:21,040
um the cdes that i see

2690
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:22,320
frequently um when i look at cves

2691
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:24,880
against dependent

2692
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:26,960
libraries uh very very frequently in

2693
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:30,560
fact most of the time

2694
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,360
those cbes are not um indicating and

2695
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:35,520
disclos

2696
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:37,759
indicating a vulnerability in a

2697
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:39,600
in the way i'm using that library and

2698
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:40,159
the same is going to be true about rfcs

2699
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,440
right

2700
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:46,480
if there is a vulnerability that

2701
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:48,960
only has to do with certain

2702
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:49,919
implementations and use cases and the

2703
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,960
tool

2704
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:54,960
uh that implements this particular rfc

2705
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,560
doesn't pickle that particular issue as

2706
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:58,400
he said then yeah

2707
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,920
it's it's not going to be a particular

2708
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,839
issue um

2709
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,679
but i don't know i don't know that that

2710
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:08,159
particular piece

2711
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:11,760
is either a actually possible to solve

2712
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:14,960
or c or b a

2713
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:18,080
um but something that we need to solve

2714
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,960
because the thing this exact same

2715
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,119
problem happens

2716
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:24,320
in lots of other places and it doesn't

2717
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:28,400
prevent us from producing

2718
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,400
these easily digestible uh

2719
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,840
mechanisms

2720
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,440
yeah absolutely and the other bits of

2721
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:42,080
feedback that have

2722
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,480
uh have come in as the cv topic for rfcs

2723
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,800
have

2724
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,320
come up is a reminder that rfcs come in

2725
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,920
a lot of flavors something some of them

2726
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,759
are our protocol specs some of them

2727
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:51,360
document operational practices

2728
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:53,520
and to the question of dependencies you

2729
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:55,920
know we have uh rfcs that do

2730
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:57,040
updates on other kind of rfcs and so

2731
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:58,560
when you tag something

2732
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,880
it could mean a lot of different things

2733
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:02,480
but uh but but concur that it's quite

2734
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,679
similar to the the current software

2735
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:05,280
equivalent system as well

2736
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:08,560
yeah that's why we need the conversation

2737
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,559
in the mailing list thanks

2738
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,840
okay dave uh sorry to skip you

2739
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:21,280
so the cv program is actually working

2740
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:23,280
they have an existing um cv record

2741
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:26,080
format that describes

2742
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:27,599
a lot of metadata about a vulnerability

2743
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,760
we're currently in the process of

2744
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:31,040
revising that format um the previous

2745
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,199
format was version four

2746
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:34,320
we're working on uh version five right

2747
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:35,678
now

2748
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:38,400
and you know part of what we're trying

2749
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:40,800
to do is add a lot more contextual

2750
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:44,239
metadata um

2751
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:47,679
this problem of how do we

2752
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:50,879
how do we identify um the interaction

2753
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:53,360
or you know the um the aspect of

2754
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,040
a given protocol or library that's

2755
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:58,400
vulnerable has definitely come up

2756
01:39:55,040 --> 01:40:00,480
in in that situation um that's something

2757
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:02,799
that we're interested in solving

2758
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,400
either in version 5 or in sub-subsequent

2759
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:06,239
version

2760
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:07,440
i would recommend that this community

2761
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:09,040
not

2762
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:10,799
you know not go off and create an

2763
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:12,320
additional record format for

2764
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,239
representing a vulnerability there's

2765
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:16,559
already a plethora of those out there

2766
01:40:14,239 --> 01:40:18,799
today but it would be great if we could

2767
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:21,600
find a way for this community

2768
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,000
to work with the cve program to work to

2769
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,280
solve

2770
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,360
these problems um you know because then

2771
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:29,199
we could actually produce a

2772
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:31,440
a more robust record format for

2773
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:32,879
describing a vulnerability in a way

2774
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,480
i think they could serve this community

2775
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,480
as well as all of the other communities

2776
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:38,959
served by cve

2777
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,480
um i'd be interested in exploring that

2778
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,159
uh maybe i should post something to the

2779
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:45,199
list

2780
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:48,559
yeah definitely if there's a forum

2781
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:51,839
where people can engage with the cbe

2782
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,840
maintenance community

2783
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:55,519
so dave i was gonna say follow-up

2784
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,760
question uh

2785
01:40:55,520 --> 01:41:00,560
is the cv program have other sdos that

2786
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:03,199
are on board as well

2787
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,080
no i mean this is kind of a new space um

2788
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:07,199
you know there's not

2789
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:07,760
a lot of stos out there that are um that

2790
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,839
are issue

2791
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,600
that are there's no sdo that's a cna

2792
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,679
right now um

2793
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,760
and so any protocol vulnerabilities that

2794
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,560
have been issued a cvid

2795
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,920
was done by the cna of last resort you

2796
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,440
know which is operated by

2797
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,920
mitre um and um and so this is new

2798
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,239
ground

2799
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,800
you know looking at an sdo actually

2800
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:30,239
issuing cv ids and so

2801
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:31,440
because it's new ground we're we're

2802
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,839
gonna have to work through some of these

2803
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,839
issues

2804
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:37,440
thanks

2805
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,119
okay joe i think you're up

2806
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,719
uh so i i think you know the cbe format

2807
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,480
as it stands now

2808
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:52,320
or you know the information contained

2809
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:54,959
isn't perfect but it's still

2810
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,559
really useful right and and you know

2811
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:59,280
some things you can do

2812
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,880
you know through automation but there's

2813
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,400
a lot of things that still you might not

2814
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,320
be able to because of the

2815
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,080
either the quality information in the cv

2816
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,960
or lacking some details and it's really

2817
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:08,559
encouraging

2818
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,880
that there's you know continuing work

2819
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:14,000
going on here and and i think it would

2820
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:15,520
be worthwhile to see um

2821
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,600
you know how we could link up with that

2822
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:19,440
because i think it

2823
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,719
would be better not to create yet

2824
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:23,119
another format

2825
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,880
um but i think some of the value that we

2826
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:26,719
would provide is just thinking through

2827
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,239
you know what are the things that we

2828
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:31,280
want to have

2829
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:33,199
you know associated with it and with you

2830
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,159
know vulnerabilities that are in rfcs

2831
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,320
and what

2832
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:38,239
what counts as a vulnerability in rfc

2833
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:40,880
versus you know implementation

2834
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:42,559
vulnerabilities that are not really

2835
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:44,320
protocol vulnerabilities but

2836
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,920
you know it's still maybe help to have

2837
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:49,040
those associated

2838
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:51,119
you know and categorized in that way um

2839
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,760
both for somebody who's looking for

2840
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:55,679
issues and and for our own information

2841
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:58,159
when we go back and look at well

2842
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:59,199
which protocols have had problems and

2843
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:03,839
and why

2844
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:03,839
um i think it could be really useful

2845
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,840
yeah so i guess we are looking to dave

2846
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,119
to

2847
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,400
sort of give us an email that tells us

2848
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:14,400
where we should be talking about these

2849
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:19,360
things if there's a good forum

2850
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:19,360
at the cde side

2851
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,119
and of course if we i'll certainly do

2852
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,440
that

2853
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,559
yeah if you need a mailing list uh idtf

2854
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:31,678
hosted mailing lists are

2855
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,679
cheap and easy thanks

2856
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,560
good the good place of synergy might be

2857
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,080
the the new mailing list we'll create

2858
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:40,639
kind of regardless of that class of

2859
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,639
coordination

2860
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:51,679
okay so honest i think you're up

2861
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:55,760
yeah um in the oaus working group we

2862
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:58,239
looked at various security incidents and

2863
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,800
related to all us and many of them were

2864
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:01,919
actually

2865
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:02,480
fairly complex and so it was i'm trying

2866
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,280
to see

2867
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,599
how that disclosure process would

2868
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,080
actually work in practice with idf

2869
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,000
protocols because

2870
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,280
first we had to have the problem to

2871
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,159
actually even

2872
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:18,239
learn about the incident at the level of

2873
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:18,559
detail that we could make an assessment

2874
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,480
of

2875
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,639
what was actually the problem which is

2876
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,159
often uh a challenge you hear that oh

2877
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,119
there's a problem with overs

2878
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:27,759
but you don't get to know like what was

2879
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:31,280
really the

2880
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:34,560
the setup and then um

2881
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:38,400
some people extended take shortcuts

2882
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,719
uh and or modify the protocol or use it

2883
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:42,239
in an

2884
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:42,560
un expected way and understanding all of

2885
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:44,480
this

2886
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,639
um requires a lot of time you know

2887
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:50,718
sometimes um we are talking about

2888
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:53,920
uh months here if you try hard

2889
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:56,239
and so i wonder who is then

2890
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,840
actually asked to do that to really say

2891
01:44:56,239 --> 01:45:00,879
like what is the problem what do we

2892
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,800
need to do um it's

2893
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,480
it sounds very challenging it sounds

2894
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,400
like a good idea in

2895
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:08,718
in theory but in practice it's really

2896
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,719
tough

2897
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:16,400
respond hottest no question that there's

2898
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:18,639
a complexity in

2899
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,040
overlaying the kind of coordination

2900
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,560
process on how we do things in the ietf

2901
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,239
uh minimally not to kind of break

2902
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,159
anything but uh

2903
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:28,718
some of the feedback i've at least heard

2904
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:31,199
on the value mentioned kind of here

2905
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:31,760
in a previous conversations is that you

2906
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:34,719
know

2907
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,440
as we think about folks coming to our

2908
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:38,000
documents

2909
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:39,199
would there be some easy way through the

2910
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,679
cv process

2911
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:43,199
to just kind of signal to implementers

2912
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:46,639
that there are kind of issues

2913
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:48,400
uh with kind of metadata and

2914
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,840
you know so that that could be one thing

2915
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:52,480
that that's done

2916
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:54,320
and uh you know hotness is also being

2917
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:58,000
modest i wanted to reiterate

2918
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:59,840
uh in making the the text for that we're

2919
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,679
about to kind of publish i surveyed

2920
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:03,199
practices across the ietf that were

2921
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,080
published for vulnerability

2922
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:06,638
disclosure and oauth is the only working

2923
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:08,719
group

2924
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:10,320
active working group uh and closed

2925
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,000
working group that i could find that by

2926
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,759
charter had actually taken the time

2927
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,040
to publish how they would handle the

2928
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,760
injective vulnerabilities

2929
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:19,360
so kind of kudos to the to the current

2930
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:23,440
oauth chairs and the foresight of

2931
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:23,440
the previous ads and chairs who did the

2932
01:46:24,840 --> 01:46:27,840
charter

2933
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,080
yeah i guess just to follow up on one

2934
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:33,040
semi-related point you know if there is

2935
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:35,840
going to be a very

2936
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,719
long extended process to figure out what

2937
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,760
exactly the

2938
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:41,760
vulnerability is um it

2939
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,199
seems almost certain that you know the

2940
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,239
working group itself is going to have to

2941
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,638
get involved with that

2942
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:48,080
and i know if you're talking about

2943
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:50,480
confidential disclosure

2944
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,760
that may not always directly be

2945
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:55,119
applicable but i think that

2946
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:57,679
uh the the way that itf operates

2947
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,880
with generally open and community

2948
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,080
participation

2949
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:03,040
we're gonna have to get to the working

2950
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,040
group at some point

2951
01:47:06,239 --> 01:47:10,638
uh chris you're back

2952
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:15,040
yeah i i was just gonna point out that

2953
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:18,480
um

2954
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:20,239
this inevitably uh inevitably there will

2955
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:22,320
be disclosures filed against

2956
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:24,400
uh working groups that are now completed

2957
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,880
have completed their work

2958
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:28,960
and so we'll need to make sure there

2959
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:37,840
won't always be a live working group

2960
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:37,840
to handle the situation yes

2961
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:44,239
sean go ahead

2962
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:48,000
hey so that makes me think about trying

2963
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,320
to resolve a rata

2964
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,159
from uh closed working groups it's

2965
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:53,679
really difficult to get the minor the

2966
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:56,400
smallest things fixed

2967
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,440
if you're trying to resolve uh a cve

2968
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,599
against a

2969
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,638
a long closed working group i mean good

2970
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:03,280
luck um

2971
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,800
it's gonna be very difficult to do that

2972
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:06,480
um i guess the other thing i'll add is

2973
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:07,520
that at one point i was being copied on

2974
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,959
a lot of uh see

2975
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:12,480
of vulnerabilities um for a particular

2976
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:13,760
working group that i was the chair of

2977
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:15,360
and i basically told them to stop

2978
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,960
copying me because there was nothing i

2979
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:19,119
could really do with it and i was really

2980
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,520
concerned about trying to maintain the

2981
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:22,960
confidentiality requirements and there

2982
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,239
was like you know you can talk about it

2983
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:25,440
now you can't talk about it then and i

2984
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:26,159
was like i really don't need to know

2985
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:27,440
about this

2986
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,119
this sounds like an implementation

2987
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,638
problem when you guys have come to an

2988
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,759
agreement to fix it that's great please

2989
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:32,000
come to the working group and tell us

2990
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,719
about

2991
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,760
it later um so it's definitely some

2992
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:36,800
things you're going to have to think

2993
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:39,440
about how to

2994
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,440
how to work through

2995
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:50,480
yep

2996
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:51,119
dave uh go ahead the things we're trying

2997
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:54,159
to dispel

2998
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:57,280
in cv is this notion that um every

2999
01:48:54,159 --> 01:49:01,040
vulnerability needs a fix

3000
01:48:57,280 --> 01:49:01,920
it's possible it's possible to publish a

3001
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,760
vulnerability

3002
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,040
you know without you know without any

3003
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,119
fix and so

3004
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:09,679
you know one one advantage of doing

3005
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:13,199
something like that is it could be

3006
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:16,159
a further motivating factor for

3007
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:17,040
implementers to move away from you know

3008
01:49:16,159 --> 01:49:19,759
older

3009
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:22,400
um you know protocols that um you know

3010
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:24,400
have a lot of inherent vulnerabilities

3011
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:27,519
um you know to newer versions that you

3012
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:29,440
know don't have those vulnerabilities so

3013
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,800
you know if if there isn't a working

3014
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:34,320
group and you know the

3015
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:36,719
the protocol is the community is working

3016
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:38,960
to try to move on from that protocol

3017
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,000
um issuing a cv id for something that

3018
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,280
isn't fixed

3019
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,360
you know it could be a potential

3020
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:44,719
motivator you know to get implementers

3021
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:46,320
to upgrade

3022
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,480
so that's something else to think about

3023
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,480
here

3024
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:57,840
yeah it makes sense

3025
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:05,520
honest go ahead yeah um just to give you

3026
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:09,679
an example of a problem we ran into

3027
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:12,960
was um oas uses the json web tokens

3028
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:16,239
and that work was

3029
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,520
standardized in the idf and there were

3030
01:50:16,239 --> 01:50:20,159
lots of libraries

3031
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:22,159
available that produced these jwds and

3032
01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:22,960
the corresponding security mechanisms

3033
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:26,159
but

3034
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:29,040
what many implementers did was

3035
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:30,719
they didn't uh include sort of code for

3036
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:32,400
the policy handling so if you

3037
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,719
included an algorithm that was

3038
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:38,480
completely insecure like um

3039
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:41,440
no and none null algorithm then

3040
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:42,159
the software if you didn't pay attention

3041
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,919
would

3042
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:46,320
would just accept that you could

3043
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:47,520
basically modify the tokens in the way

3044
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:50,159
you like it

3045
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:52,239
um by just saying none and then there's

3046
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:52,719
no signature protecting it and so and so

3047
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:55,598
on

3048
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:57,119
so obviously a problem um is it a

3049
01:50:55,599 --> 01:51:00,159
problem with the rsc um

3050
01:50:57,119 --> 01:51:00,639
not to a certain extent like maybe there

3051
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:02,638
shouldn't

3052
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:04,080
uh there should be no such algorithm in

3053
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,800
the first place but

3054
01:51:04,080 --> 01:51:08,400
that aside we would then wanted to reach

3055
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:11,199
out to the guys who

3056
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,799
wrote those libraries and and it turns

3057
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:14,239
out that this is also extremely

3058
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,040
difficult um

3059
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:18,320
because the ecosystem is for some of our

3060
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:21,599
protocols so huge

3061
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:24,960
uh we don't know who is implementing

3062
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:27,360
uh even a fraction of it and then uh

3063
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:29,360
those people are deploying it this is

3064
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:31,519
like a completely different story

3065
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:33,040
so if we find a vulnerability and know

3066
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:35,840
it and then describe it as well

3067
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:37,599
and then make it available with an

3068
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,360
ability to actually reach out to the

3069
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:40,800
implementers of those libraries or to

3070
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,839
the people who deploy it actually we

3071
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,719
make the situation

3072
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:46,560
uh potentially worse than before so just

3073
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,159
saying oh move on to something else i

3074
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:51,599
think it's not uh

3075
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:54,879
always a good approach

3076
01:51:51,599 --> 01:51:56,719
because our work um starts right early

3077
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:00,159
we move on we always go to the next

3078
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:02,159
uh the shiny the shiny new thing but uh

3079
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:04,320
implementers need a lot on deploying

3080
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:06,000
community need a lot of time

3081
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,440
and they deploy technologies that we

3082
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,800
worked on like like

3083
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:13,440
five or ten years ago um so it's really

3084
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,800
it's really tricky to do that and so i

3085
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,559
wish sometimes

3086
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,719
there were fewer implementations but

3087
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,119
just better maintained

3088
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:22,320
because people move on and leave the

3089
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:30,400
code out there and

3090
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:31,519
it's it's actually a ticking time pump

3091
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:34,159
yeah that's good caution thank you

3092
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:35,520
honest yeah ties into sort of

3093
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:37,280
responsible disclosure for

3094
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,719
vulnerabilities in general and

3095
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:45,840
trying to figure out how to do the right

3096
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:48,880
thing can vary on a case-by-case basis

3097
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:48,880
uh dave you're back

3098
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:53,440
on us to think about though is that so i

3099
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,920
completely agree with what you're saying

3100
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,719
and that's

3101
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:57,360
certainly a classic problem in in this

3102
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,639
space

3103
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:03,920
um you know another advantage of

3104
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,400
you know publishing a cvid would be also

3105
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:06,159
a way

3106
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:08,080
a mechanism to publish you know

3107
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:11,839
guidelines around

3108
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:13,360
how to mitigate a given vulnerability so

3109
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,040
you know where there are existing

3110
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,960
implementations that are vulnerable and

3111
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:19,440
it may be difficult to replace them or

3112
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:22,239
upgrade them or you know whatever the

3113
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:23,199
you know whatever the more ideal path

3114
01:53:22,239 --> 01:53:25,360
would be

3115
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:26,480
um it might be an opportunity for the

3116
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:29,679
ietf to

3117
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:31,119
you know publish guidance on um

3118
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,880
how to put in place compensating

3119
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:35,920
controls or you know other

3120
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:38,560
other things to to for for

3121
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,960
both implementers and users to consider

3122
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,000
um

3123
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:44,159
to you know reduce the

3124
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,719
you know the risk of the vulnerability

3125
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:48,559
being exploited

3126
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:50,719
um so it could be used as part of an

3127
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:55,520
awareness campaign to support that type

3128
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:58,080
of activity too

3129
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,080
yeah great

3130
01:53:58,719 --> 01:54:02,639
uh and as we leave the queue open i do

3131
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:05,840
want to note

3132
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:09,040
that we have had some

3133
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,800
notes being taken in the coding d and

3134
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:12,719
thank you very much to whoever is doing

3135
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,280
that please leave your name

3136
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:16,560
at the top as having contributed to the

3137
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:23,840
minutes and then we can thank you

3138
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:23,840
properly when those get sent out

3139
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:36,159
and as the queue remains empty we have

3140
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,520
six minutes left in our time slot so we

3141
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:41,199
are kind of

3142
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:41,199
approaching the end regardless

3143
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,480
all right the queue is still empty so i

3144
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:52,480
think we should call it

3145
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:54,480
thank you everyone for attending thank

3146
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:56,239
you ryan for the talk

3147
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,759
thank you for the excellent discussion

3148
01:54:56,239 --> 01:55:00,959
on all the points that we had

3149
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,239
and we've got some follow-up work for us

3150
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:05,199
to work on so

3151
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:08,879
this was a good meeting thanks everyone

3152
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:19,839
and we'll see you in gather town

3153
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:19,840
take care everyone

3154
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,360
you
