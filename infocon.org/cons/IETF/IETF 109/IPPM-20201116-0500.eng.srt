the jabber room is very conveniently

61
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,919
accessible in the chat panel

62

and we do have a note taker and

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
just watch chat and be our scribe

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,440
all right so we have a pretty full

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,199
agenda like normal um

68
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,880
we're going to cover first some of our

69
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
existing working group items there

70
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
aren't

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,039
too many of these um a lot of them are

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
pretty mature

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
mainly we have a bunch of iom documents

74
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
that

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
are progressing we also have a number of

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,080
documents that we have

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,280
open calls for adoption on and so we

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,479
want to go through those

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,758
and discuss the status of those

80
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,360
after that we have um several other

81
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
documents that have received a lot of

82
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
discussion

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
and would be candidates for calls for

84
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,560
adoption soon

85
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,880
and then some lightning talks to round

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880

which is a combination of the v6

172
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,719
deployment and

173
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,040
the euler v6 options and then telus

174
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,120
going to go and talk about the other two

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,079
so on the v6 options draft if you flip

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,160
to the next slide

177
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,000
there is two updates that we've done so

178
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,439
you've seen two new revisions

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,839
the o3 and the o4 version the o3 version

180
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
was a reflection of the last working

181
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,399
group meeting

182
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,399
where we at length debated

183
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
well how we should go and address the

184
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,519
fact that

185
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,440
well there was a a section on

186
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
deployment considerations which was

187
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
outdated

188
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
that was this one paragraph that you

189
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,880
probably remember that started with an

190
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,800
order for iom to work in ipv6 networks

191
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,320
well that was a stale paragraph because

192
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
we had all the deployment

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
considerations moved to the

194
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,399
quote-unquote deployment draft

195
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
and so based on the chair's

196
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,839
recommendations we decided to go and

197
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
merge the two documents as opposed to

198
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,120
progress them independently

199
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,479
and so that happened and the o3 version

200
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
was just

201
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,120
an editorial merge with kind of

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,079
nuances to go and uh resolve circular

203
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
references

204
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
otherwise right because the the

205
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
documents were referring to each other

206
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,760
um so that's the the all three thing

207
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,720
that that happened along with obviously

208
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,640
removing the

209
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
the paragraph in question and if you

210
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,000
flip forward one additional slide

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
then um you'll see that uh after the

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
merger

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,160
tell me if you can go and go to the next

214
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,120
slide okay thank you

215
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
um then tommy spent a little bit of time

216
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,720
that was one too fair

217
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,120
far um then thanks to tommy uh he spent

218
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,760
uh a fair amount of time on cleaning up

219
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
the language

220
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,760
especially in the the sections and came

221
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,440
in from the deployment draft

222
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,959
so that we have a fairly solid

223
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,040
document by now that includes

224
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,560
extensive coverage of deployment

225
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,079
considerations

226
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,479
along with the ask for uh code points

227
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,800
for

228
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,560
uh uh v6 um hot by hop option types and

229
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,880
um the destination option type

230
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,319
and um the only thing that we haven't

231
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,000
really resolved

232
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
was uh because uh well i think uh we

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,079
hadn't really discussed that at length

234
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,079
and tommy just came up with a suggestion

235
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,040
uh was this like ah the author list is

236
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,800
too long so

237
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,719
the typical thing that we have and

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,839
so suggestion is to again move to an

239
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
editor model

240
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,959
like we had it with the uh the data

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,560
draft

242
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,399
uh which would mean like given that

243
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,319
sweater authored pretty much the v6

244
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,440
option document and wrote it

245
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
and i wrote the deployment draft to a

246
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,760
large extent

247
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,440
um the suggestion is just to go and have

248
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,720
these two pieces with people as

249
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,800
editors and uh if there is nothing

250
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
other major coming up i think we can go

251
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,120
and aim for

252
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,639
maybe another revision maybe none um and

253
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
well we need one revision to go and

254
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
clean up the author list but uh maybe we

255
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
can also go and do additional nuances if

256
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,920
somebody has ones

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,760
uh but i believe what we're very close

258
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,560
to being able also to go and

259
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,639
go to work new gospel that's pretty much

260
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,638
it

261
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
any quick thoughts otherwise we can

262
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,320
progress to

263
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
tell and maybe just go and do the

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,959
questions and answers

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
at the very end of the presentation yeah

266
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,319
i don't see anyone in the queue

267
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,519
um yeah thank you for that update and

268
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,839
just a

269
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,000
comment in general on our author lists

270
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,880
um

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
you know this is kind of the same

272
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,360
comment we're going to have on any

273
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,880
document that has

274
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,240
the warning within the rf within data

275
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,000
tracker so

276
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,160
please if you have a lot of authors

277
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,040
let's do an editor model there's

278
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
nothing wrong with doing that so thank

279
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,719
you for

280
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,719
being willing to move to that authors

281
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:23,920
all right should we move ahead

282
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,920
all right

283
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,479
try speaking yeah can you hear me can

284
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,480
you see me

285
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:38,079
yes both

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:42,560
so um let's talk about the iom

287
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,560
flag draft so next slide please

288
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,320
okay so the status of this draft

289
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,360
basically we've

290
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,240
updated the draft recently and the most

291
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,000
notable open issue was regarding the

292
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,959
lubeck flag

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,920
and just a reminder the open issue was

294
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,800
how to handle

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,800
loopback on the reverse path that is

296
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,519
when an iom node

297
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
decides to loop back a packet what it

298
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,440
needs to do

299
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,439
when it sends that looped back packet

300
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,480
and what the other iom nodes along the

301
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
path

302
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,240
need to do as they forward uh the packet

303
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,440
back to its origin

304
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
so uh basically we've updated the draft

305
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
based on

306
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,760
our thoughts uh from the design team

307
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,079
meetings

308
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,319
and just a few words about the solution

309
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,239
uh the current proposal

310
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,120
is basically on the forward path

311
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,639
uh the iom packet has its loopback flag

312
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
set

313
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,880
and then once an ion node decides to

314
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,560
loop back that packet

315
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,000
it clears that low back flag

316
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,839
so on the reverse path the luba flag is

317
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
not set and now iom transit nodes along

318
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,279
the path

319
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,279
just push iom data

320
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:08,240
and once that packet reaches

321
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,079
the iom edge

322
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,480
at the edge of the domain basically the

323
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,519
encapsulating node which originated the

324
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,040
lubeck

325
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:21,920
packet receives that looped back packet

326
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,680
and detects the fact that this was a

327
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,120
loopback packet based on

328
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:30,239
comparing its node id to the id of the

329
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
current iom node

330
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,440
in this way the originating i am

331
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,839
encapsulating node

332
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,079
knows that it needs to terminate the

333
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,480
packet

334
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,079
this is basically the solution and it's

335
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,480
already described in the current version

336
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,279
of the draft

337
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
next slide please

338
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,439
so since we haven't had any comments

339
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,959
about the solution we're assuming that

340
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,079
uh it's a reasonable solution

341
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,239
of course if there are any other

342
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,120
comments we'd be happy to hear them

343
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,560
but um this was actually the last open

344
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,680
issue we've had about

345
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,638
this draft and

346
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,479
assuming we've resolved this we would

347
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
like to recommend to proceed to working

348
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,839
group last call

349
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
comments please

350
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,800
we have uh two people in the queue uh

351
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
greg do you want to go first uh let's

352
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,800
see if i can

353
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,959
mention uh okay well i'd like to

354
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,399
meet you so hopefully tommy can figure

355
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,160
okay

356
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,519
thank you um thank you for updating um

357
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,920
i still have a question of so

358
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:51,199
since um iem data is included

359
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,399
uh in the loopback mode

360
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
and send back how uh look back then is

361
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,480
different

362
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,479
from the direct export

363
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,880
option yeah we've had this

364
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
question in the past and again it's

365
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,039
it's somewhat of a semantical question

366
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,559
but

367
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:18,559
direct exporting is in my view

368
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,280
management plan entity basically the

369
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,879
result is reporting to report it to a

370
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,240
collector

371
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,760
whereas blue back is used

372
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,360
uh by the data plane okay or

373
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,280
it's a control plane entity but it's

374
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,959
used along the

375
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,960
path of the data plane so the result

376
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,200
is reported back to the node which

377
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,880
originated the packet

378
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
and again my view loopback is intended

379
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,200
to

380
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,720
trace the path or to find the problem

381
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
along the path

382
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,760
whereas direct exporting is intended to

383
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,760
be reported to the management plan and

384
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:04,160
to be used by the management plan but

385
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,679
in direct export as i understand uh

386
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,799
their uh destination of

387
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,080
uh this exported uh packet could be

388
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:18,160
their uh

389
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,879
edge of uh iom trace

390
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
so right good effectively it can be

391
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,240
anything

392
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,240
including the node which is

393
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,879
receiving in the loopback so from that

394
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,840
point of view

395
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
it does look like uh the loopback is a

396
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,639
special case

397
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
of the direct export

398
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,840
right yes again i think we've discussed

399
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,880
this in the past so

400
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,918
you could implement loopback by direct

401
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,000
export but

402
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,480
you would get a slightly different

403
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,679
result because again in loopback

404
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,559
you get the ion data from each

405
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
of the iom nodes along the path and in

406
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,280
direct

407
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,039
exporting you only get the information

408
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,480
from a single iom

409
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,120
node at the time so

410
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
buy routine

411
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,080
destination you already know all the

412
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,559
notes along the path

413
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,039
uh well that kind of

414
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,600
not as i understood direct export

415
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,120
because

416
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,959
direct export works on each and every

417
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,320
i am node capable node along

418
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
the path of the data packet right right

419
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,120
yes

420
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
yes what i mean is though in lubeck by

421
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,879
single packet you already get

422
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,600
all the information about the nodes

423
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
along the path

424
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,000
[Music]

425
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,240
no i understand that each node

426
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
along the path set if there is a

427
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,799
loopback packet

428
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,679
flag set will send

429
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,679
iom data

430
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:12,720
so which works like a link trace in

431
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,720
internet oem

432
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
and direct export works the same is just

433
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,440
their

434
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:24,719
destination of i am data

435
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,600
is configurable so to me

436
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,320
the direct export does look like a more

437
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,678
general

438
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,879
and more flexible method of tracing

439
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,559
and getting collecting their uh

440
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,799
information from the

441
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,360
trace of the package so i am information

442
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,360
from the pack

443
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
i i think that we can take it to the

444
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,480
list but i still have this

445
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,158
uh question and i would like to clarify

446
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,039
it before we move forward

447
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,679
uh with the next step progressing this

448
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,039
document

449
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,799
thank you okay

450
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,799
thanks rick martin do you want to go

451
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,520
yeah and yeah you should definitely buy

452
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,559
this on the list sorry to

453
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,400
not confirm so um

454
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,678
i i did take a look at these drafts a

455
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,200
couple days ago and

456
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,480
um thank you for addressing the the like

457
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,280
the basic amplification issue uh which

458
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,280
i think we've discussed ad nauseam i i

459
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,120
was attempting to think this through

460
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,559
and i'm not that for both this and

461
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,799
direct export

462
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,080
i'm somewhat concerned about uh corner

463
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,080
cases where multiple

464
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,559
namespaces are interacting in ways that

465
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:45,039
cause geometric or even

466
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,360
infinite loops of of of um

467
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
of uh iom packets going back and forth

468
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,959
um i will take that to the list because

469
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,919
it would be impossible for me to explain

470
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
verbally right now uh but just uh please

471
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,159
look out for that and i'd be interested

472
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,280
in your thoughts on this

473
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
if you would like me to talk through i

474
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:13,840
can but i have a feeling it just gets

475
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:13,840
too complicated

476
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,679
um yeah i'm actually still worried about

477
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
the amplification attack because it's

478
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,120
different than with trace routers tracer

479
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,080
you have to send one packet for every

480
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
packet you receive

481
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,799
back um and that's not the case here you

482
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,639
have to send one pack and get like

483
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,080
bunch packets back depending on how long

484
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
it passes

485
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,600
so i think this is not appropriately

486
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,240
resolved

487
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,879
and also the discussion in the security

488
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,559
section is

489
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,919
like mentioning it but doesn't provide

490
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,360
any kind of

491
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,880
uh measures to mitigate this problem so

492
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,719
i mean like the minimum would be to talk

493
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,919
about rate limiting these kind of things

494
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,440
you can reflect

495
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,159
um but i think uh if you if you

496
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,240
if you consider a different design for

497
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,799
getting the same information

498
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,120
um that would be worth it like instead

499
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,039
of trying to reflect from every

500
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,959
um router one single packet you could

501
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,360
just send one packet back on the on the

502
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,240
reverse part and accumulate um

503
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,199
information there or something like that

504
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,600
um

505
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,640
because that's a serious issue and i

506
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,678
think it needs to

507
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,640
be further addressed

508
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,120
so regarding amplification attacks uh

509
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,240
again

510
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,320
of course maria we've we've

511
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
received this uh feedback in the past

512
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,360
and what we've done in the

513
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,320
draft is a few things first of all we

514
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,959
point out the problem we say we have a

515
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,120
problem

516
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,760
we know we have a problem so it's it's

517
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,760
out there in the draft

518
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:51,360
second what we do is

519
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,640
recommend to or actually don't recommend

520
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,678
the requirement

521
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,960
is to use only a single

522
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,000
data field in loopback packets in order

523
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,480
to reduce

524
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,159
the amplification problem

525
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,640
okay so the magnitude of the

526
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,760
amplification is limited

527
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,880
and uh we also discussed rate limiting

528
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,000
like you mentioned that's

529
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,919
that's also uh one of the things that is

530
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,279
described in the draft so i think we

531
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:27,200
at least tried to point out the problem

532
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:30,720
and to suggest solutions

533
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,039
and i think the

534
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,480
your your last suggestion to basically

535
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,240
limit uh

536
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,320
the number of responses you get from

537
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,520
each message that would just

538
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,639
reduce the performance of the mechanism

539
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,400
so uh there was there's always a

540
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,279
trade-off here between

541
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,240
how bad the security attack is and what

542
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,039
you can gain from the mechanism

543
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,880
so right now we've chosen the

544
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,039
performance of what you can get from the

545
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,679
mechanism

546
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
yeah so the problem is uh there is a

547
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,880
tradeoff right

548
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,720
and this is a serious attack and the

549
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,799
problem is this attack is not really

550
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,559
limited in a protocol way that you can

551
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,480
say you know it's never more than this

552
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,399
much packet right it can be like a huge

553
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,840
number of packets and

554
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,960
and i think that's still not um really

555
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,720
um satisfying um i did i did somehow

556
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,480
over at the rate limiting because i was

557
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,919
looking at the security section and it

558
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,200
doesn't say anything there so maybe you

559
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,720
have to put some more text

560
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,840
but i think um more consideration

561
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,840
would still be needed

562
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,760
okay thank you i appreciate what's um

563
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,159
maybe follow up on the

564
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,480
list and see if we can come to a good

565
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,559
conclusion on these issues

566
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,559
so sure back to you tommy

567
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,039
thanks help okay the next draft we want

568
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,799
to talk about

569
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,520
is the direct exporting draft

570
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,520
next slide please

571
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,400
so we had a long discussion about this

572
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
both in

573
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,640
design team meetings and on the mailing

574
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,000
list and we've recently

575
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
uh submitted an updated draft uh we have

576
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,200
two

577
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,720
pending open issues uh which we're going

578
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
to discuss in the next

579
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
few slides so bear with me the main

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,679
change in the

581
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,440
current version of the draft which is

582
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,720
version zero two

583
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,520
compared to the previous version is that

584
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,480
uh we moved the discussion about the hub

585
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,600
count

586
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,760
to an appendix so right now in terms of

587
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,158
the functionality of the draft it does

588
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,919
not

589
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,360
define a hop count field but it does

590
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:52,000
have an appendix that discusses uh

591
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:55,279
the need for hub count how it can be

592
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,400
it can be implemented

593
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,760
by using the uh ttl data field

594
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,480
the node id hub limit data field

595
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,240
and the trade-off between having a

596
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,679
dedicated hop count field and

597
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,559
using the existing data fields

598
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,559
next slide please

599
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,240
a few words about this open issue so

600
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,000
regarding the hubcount field we've

601
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,320
discussed this a few times in the past

602
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,960
so just a few words to

603
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,000
uh recap here so it's either we don't

604
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,159
use a spec

605
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,480
dedicated hop count field or we do use

606
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,440
it so if we don't use a dedicated hop

607
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,039
count field the main advantage is that

608
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,320
iom nodes along the path do not need to

609
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,279
update

610
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,480
the direct exporting option header they

611
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,679
just need to

612
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,760
forward it to process it uh

613
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,360
which simplifies what ion nodes need to

614
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,840
do in terms of direct exporting

615
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,000
on the other hand using an explicit

616
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,678
hubcon field means that

617
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,520
in in some cases you get more

618
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,039
information in

619
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,480
specific cases you can detect

620
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,039
iom capable nodes that

621
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,559
have a problem in exporting and

622
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
performing the direct exporting

623
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,120
functionality

624
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,760
also in some cases the ttl is not

625
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,120
available

626
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,720
or not reliable so you get an explicit

627
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,918
topcon field which does this

628
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,760
at the ion layer

629
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,840
so we've had this discussion for a while

630
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,679
now and

631
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,399
right now the way the draft handles it

632
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:37,840
again is is by having

633
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,080
an appendix at the end and

634
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,320
hopefully we can resolve this issue and

635
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,199
move on

636
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,840
we can discuss that at the end next

637
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,840
slide please

638
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,240
this is another open issue that we've

639
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,960
had for quite a while now and we've been

640
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,679
struggling with how to resolve it

641
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,120
and the way currently the draft defines

642
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,480
it is the

643
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,439
direct exporting option has two

644
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
possible modes two modes of operation

645
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,320
one

646
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,960
is to have a an eight byte

647
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,200
option header and the other is to have a

648
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,960
16 byte option header

649
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,840
and in the second mode you also have two

650
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
fields which are

651
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,279
sequence number and the flow id

652
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,120
so these two fields are optional and the

653
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,520
way the draft defines it right now is

654
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,959
that

655
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,720
the length of the option header is

656
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,120
uh implied by the lower layer headers

657
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
so you know the length by reading the

658
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,399
header of the previous

659
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,159
layer so the open issue and we've

660
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,559
discussed this in the past what happens

661
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,880
if in the future we want to add

662
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,080
more fields to the direct exporting

663
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,399
option

664
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,678
that would mean we would have to somehow

665
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,360
indicate

666
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,159
which which mode is used which uh

667
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,479
fields are used that would be a problem

668
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
so how do we handle this open issue one

669
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,840
solution

670
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,520
would be to use the uh reserved flags

671
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,439
right now we have quite a few reserved

672
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,120
flags we can use some of them to

673
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,960
indicate whether we have

674
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,000
the uh optional fields or not

675
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,880
another solution would be to just fix

676
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
the direct exporting header to a single

677
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,919
length

678
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,720
and have only the mandatory fields

679
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,080
and not have the optional fields at all

680
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
that would mean that if you want the

681
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,760
optional fields you would have to add

682
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
another ion option for example the end

683
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,158
to end iom option

684
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,279
and have some additional fields there

685
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,679
so this is the open issue two

686
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,520
solutions right now we are kind of

687
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,520
struggling between these two solutions

688
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,559
next slide please

689
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,039
okay so that was actually the last slide

690
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,519
so

691
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,039
any comments about these two open issues

692
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:19,840
would be welcome and we hope

693
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:19,840
that we can resolve them soon

694
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:47,840
tommy can you hear me

695
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,320
hello all right can you hear me yeah

696
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,678
so we have any comments that would be

697
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,360
great yeah

698
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,399
sorry that looks like we're having some

699
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:15,840
glitches on me deco

700
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:15,840
frank is in queue do you want to go

701
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,960
can you hear me right yes now we can

702
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,120
okay

703
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,880
excellent um i wanted to go and just

704
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,360
echo that the second option

705
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,960
is the second solution option is just

706
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,719
one that came out of the

707
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,200
iom design team as a option that i

708
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,399
believe

709
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,240
is very clean because

710
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,158
and i think that's already indicated on

711
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,080
slide number nine

712
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:45,760
hop count limit uh or hop count in index

713
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,960
is something

714
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,240
that is very similar to the hop limit

715
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,880
that we already have

716
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,120
for tracing we have a sequence number

717
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,159
defined for end to end

718
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,039
um in the current data draft

719
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,640
which would redefine index and

720
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,480
i don't really see a logic where we

721
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,720
would need to go and make

722
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,519
dax a replication of what we have in

723
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,480
other fields as opposed to we use

724
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,039
decks as a very very simple one fixed

725
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,240
header

726
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,760
no options and then everything else that

727
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,440
should go and have

728
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,320
additional flexible fields could go into

729
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,279
other options that are already built for

730
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,480
tracing

731
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,240
for for for flexibility right um so if

732
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,000
we make a clear cut there

733
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,519
i think we resolve a lot of things by

734
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,440
keeping deck simple

735
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,919
and by reusing what we already have in

736
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,720
splatter instead of re-specifying

737
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,320
and so we could go and have another ref

738
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,159
of the data graph at some point

739
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,480
and there is already in dish discussion

740
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,399
and a couple of new drafts coming in i

741
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,440
think we have one in the lightning talks

742
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,678
where people argue for new fields

743
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,279
and we can have a new field that says

744
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,000
well uh

745
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,640
uh flow id for instance what we have in

746
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
the data

747
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,720
in the dex option right now and uh add

748
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,279
that maybe to e2e

749
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,800
so that would cut things and make it

750
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,159
relatively simple we can go and close

751
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
stacks

752
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,639
um and then resolve the issues that we

753
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,639
all have here

754
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,639
thank you

755
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
greg

756
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,520
good update thank you and definitely

757
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,598
would like to uh

758
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,879
contribute to the discussion i would

759
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,919
come uh reading

760
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,879
and uh send a note uh on the mailing

761
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,000
list

762
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,000
about their options um i'm strong

763
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,918
believer in tov

764
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,599
and i think that that's the most

765
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,638
flexible and that's what we've done

766
00:34:51,599 --> 00:35:02,160
for stamp extensions so

767
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:05,599
might be we can reuse this index

768
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,960
all right thank you and it'd be great to

769
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,960
have a note to the list on that

770
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,839
okay and while you

771
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,400
uh all right we can't hear you now yeah

772
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,000
you'll need to unmute

773
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,560
you're you'll need to start sending

774
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,359
audio yourself

775
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,359
if you'd like to speak

776
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,800
you can try the reconnect audio button

777
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:45,440
in the lower right that worked for me

778
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:47,600
when my audio died a moment ago

779
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
all right we're not hearing anything um

780
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,000
[Music]

781
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,320
maybe you could put your

782
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,680
comments in the chat if that's okay

783
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
because we should probably move on for

784
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,879
time reasons yeah so thank you to all

785
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,240
for presenting this

786
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,280
um i think we've gotten a lot of good

787
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,319
input here for people who did comment

788
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,480
please

789
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,839
send an email to the list about this i

790
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
think it'd be good to have more of this

791
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,520
kind of

792
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
discussion going on with the whole

793
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,200
working group there

794
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,640
and as far as progressing things i think

795
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,000
it sounds like there needs to be work on

796
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,359
both of these continuing

797
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,760
and i'd also like to see um and ensure

798
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,240
that

799
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,599
we rationalize the relationship between

800
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,040
the two different documents

801
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:38,160
um dex and the loopback flag

802
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,800
um so i imagine them kind of progressing

803
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,200
um together rather than separately at

804
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
this moment

805
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:55,919
all right thank you very much

806
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,879
all right so next i think we are getting

807
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,640
into some of the documents that we

808
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,800
have calls for adoption out starting

809
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,240
with the ones that are related to the

810
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,680
spring

811
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:11,279
working group documents uh where we have

812
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,640
two um proposed extensions to stamp and

813
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,040
two amp um that have been spun off

814
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,480
so we could discuss those here in ippm

815
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,839
so rockets do you wanna

816
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,839
i mean great

817
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,640
and as a time track check we're running

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,760
a little longer the last one but that's

819
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,520
okay because it's um

820
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,839
you know still very important to our

821
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,359
core work so

822
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,480
yeah we're gonna reserve the same amount

823
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,119
of time that we're planning for these

824
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,880
documents

825
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:47,200
thank you okay

826
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,200
all right um you hear me

827
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,119
yes we can hear you okay thank you uh so

828
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,760
my name is raques gandhi and

829
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,880
i'm presenting uh the two drafts that

830
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,839
tommy mentioned for

831
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,839
um the bump light extensions and the

832
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:03,599
stem extensions for segment routing

833
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,759
networks

834
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,079
this where part of the spring drops and

835
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,760
they will spun off

836
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:18,560
two two ippm drops for the extensions

837
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:20,800
for these protocols next slide please

838
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,240
so we look at the requirements and scope

839
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,079
the history of the draft

840
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,520
the summary of the extensions propose

841
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,320
and next steps

842
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,320
next slide please

843
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,040
so uh this is uh addressing two

844
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,560
requirements

845
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,920
one is being the in-band delay and the

846
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,520
synthetic loss uh

847
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,560
as well as a standalone direct mode

848
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,599
loss measurement and the scope of this

849
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,640
draft is uh

850
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,119
t1 lite uh that's uh

851
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,480
basically the messages that's defined in

852
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,720
five three five seven

853
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,440
test messages with a user configure ipvp

854
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,160
uh paths which are very similar to the

855
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,920
one

856
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,440
that's rfc 8762 stamp

857
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:14,240
that became a standard recently

858
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:17,040
next slide please

859
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,680
so as uh we mentioned uh that there is a

860
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,079
spring

861
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,879
uh draft corresponding drop for this

862
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,400
ippm

863
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,359
extensions and in this string uh spring

864
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,960
drops uh

865
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,839
defines procedures for end-to-end sr

866
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,960
paths

867
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,560
for srm pls as well as srv6 data planes

868
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,640
as well as for links

869
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,560
and here the there is basically the

870
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,480
protocol extensions

871
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,000
that in theo applied there are two of

872
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,480
them and next

873
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,480
slide please

874
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,920
so there is a history of the draft

875
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,800
it's it's been around for close to two

876
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,280
years now

877
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,760
there was one draft and then became two

878
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,560
because of the one and the stem

879
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,560
and now there are four drafts being

880
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,040
split across two working groups

881
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,799
so this is why we are here and next

882
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,119
slide please

883
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,960
so the first extension for t1 flight is

884
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,520
basically adding a

885
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,800
sender control code for the in-band

886
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:25,839
response request

887
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,839
so it defines a flag next slide please

888
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,960
and the second extension is basically a

889
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,160
standalone direct mode loss measurement

890
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,359
message

891
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:38,000
it's very very similar to the delay

892
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,680
measurement test message only difference

893
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,599
here is that

894
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,040
there are transmit and receive counters

895
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,079
as opposed to the

896
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,920
transmit and receive timestamps there is

897
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,960
a separate udp port that

898
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,119
we use for the direct mode loss

899
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,560
measurement

900
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,160
so this way there is no inter

901
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,599
intersection with

902
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,960
existing delay measurement messages

903
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,520
and these are new messages physically

904
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,640
next slide please

905
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,040
so uh as uh tommy mentioned that these

906
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,078
drafts are in working group adoption

907
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,279
or right now uh so far we have received

908
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,560
review comments

909
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,920
on this one uh the first one being uh

910
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,799
on the status of the draft um

911
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,640
currently it defined extensions for the

912
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,760
applied messages

913
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,279
uh we think it updates the 5357 because

914
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
of the message format

915
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,920
change adding a new field it is

916
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,078
uh informational right now uh but

917
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,040
because of the messages probably it

918
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,240
could be a

919
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,560
proposed standard we look forward to the

920
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,560
input from the working group on the on

921
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,759
the status of this

922
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,599
um there was a review comment that maybe

923
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,800
it's not specific to sr it could be

924
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,359
generalized

925
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,599
uh or could be renamed um that sounds

926
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,119
like a good idea for this drop

927
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,920
there were a few other editorial

928
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,920
comments uh abbreviations or using a

929
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,800
correct terminology from the

930
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,800
rfc 5357 which you agree

931
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,760
there is also showing us entire packet

932
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,480
or loss we should be very clear about

933
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,839
this is that

934
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,520
word loss measurement uh some editing to

935
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,560
move some text from one section to

936
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,880
another

937
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,040
uh so yeah we would be making those

938
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,400
editorial changes as well

939
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,880
um there was a um proposed

940
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,079
well maybe we can use icmp for direct

941
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,960
loss measurement

942
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,680
we think that's out of scope for this uh

943
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:47,280
this the focus of the draft is the t1

944
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,279
base messages next slide please

945
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,160
yeah so these were the comments very

946
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,160
specific to this draft

947
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,920
there are comments some comments as well

948
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,000
for the spring drafts and there are some

949
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,400
comments as well for the scan

950
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,280
and apps that we will take a look uh the

951
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,400
next

952
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
so uh many thanks for all your great

953
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,839
support on the mailing list and the

954
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,800
review comments that

955
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,520
you have provided this is in yppm

956
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,560
working group

957
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:20,319
adoption poll and or actually

958
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:22,560
uh it's it ends on the 16th so

959
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,160
there is few more hours left for this

960
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,720
one

961
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,680
and i appreciate your review comments uh

962
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,720
uh for the

963
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,879
for those drops uh today or anytime

964
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:38,560
later as well next slide please

965
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:39,920
yeah and do we want to go um

966
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,000
we want to talk about the other draft

967
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,880
before we get to the

968
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,520
queue or do you want to take questions

969
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,400
on this one independently

970
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,400
the both drafts are very similar um

971
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
discussion could be very similar as well

972
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,200
might as well go to the second

973
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
draft and then but let's do that

974
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,720
um can we just kind of get to the

975
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,240
differences

976
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,598
maybe yeah so it's very similar

977
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,759
except it's a rfc 8762 which is a

978
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,480
standard now and

979
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,280
the one difference here is that stamp

980
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,200
allows

981
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,400
tlvs so we are taking advantage of tlbs

982
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,598
as well for the

983
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,240
extensions next slide please

984
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
next slide

985
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,560
we can skip that as well

986
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,000
yeah so this is very similar to the t1

987
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,680
light message

988
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,680
so we can skip this one as well

989
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,640
yeah so this one this is a delta for

990
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,520
stamp that

991
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,240
we're taking advantage of tlb so we're

992
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,440
defining

993
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,520
a few tlbs for the return path and

994
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,359
these are very specific right now for

995
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,880
the sr

996
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:02,078
srm pls label stack or srv6

997
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:07,359
label stacks or the binding sheet

998
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,359
of the sr policy next slide please

999
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,759
there's another tl we defined that

1000
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,839
identifies the destination node address

1001
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,000
so when the query is sent for 127

1002
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,160
address uh

1003
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,280
this this would carry the actual node

1004
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,040
address to

1005
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,960
verify that when the response comes is

1006
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:33,680
coming from the right node

1007
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:35,839
and next slide please

1008
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,000
so yeah so this is also very similar to

1009
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,960
the trump light uh only difference

1010
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,119
here is there is ssid but otherwise uh

1011
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,599
it's uh very similar to

1012
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,079
the both are similar to light and next

1013
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,079
lightness

1014
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,599
again the review comments are very

1015
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,680
similar um

1016
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,040
so draft status i think the previous

1017
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,879
comment doesn't apply this one is

1018
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,680
already proposed standard so we're just

1019
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,599
updating

1020
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:06,160
rfc 8762 uh pretty much everything else

1021
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,160
is the same

1022
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,520
in terms of review so yeah this is also

1023
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,839
in adoption for many many thanks to your

1024
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,200
review comments and

1025
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:17,200
suggestions yeah thanks

1026
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:24,319
all right should

1027
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,319
we start with greg

1028
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:33,839
go for a quick

1029
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,839
to the slide three of the first

1030
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
presentation

1031
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,680
i know the first presentation uh on t1

1032
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:56,319
[Music]

1033
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:59,520
yeah yeah thank you uh so

1034
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,880
no three slide three let's slide one

1035
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,119
back

1036
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,160
no this yeah this is three at least it's

1037
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:08,319
number three

1038
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,319
um yes so

1039
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:16,560
um t1 white already provides

1040
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,240
uh delay uh and synthetic loss

1041
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,680
measurement

1042
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,680
so i don't really see why it's a

1043
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,160
requirement that you're

1044
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,160
mentioning

1045
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,720
the second my question is so you say

1046
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,240
that there is a requirement to support

1047
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,598
direct mode loss measurement i agree

1048
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,359
that uh direct mode loss measurement is

1049
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:48,880
useful but i think it will be helpful

1050
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:49,119
if the working group discusses how to do

1051
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,119
it

1052
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:57,359
because what appears that

1053
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:00,400
you propose two different solutions

1054
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:00,400
for one problem

1055
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,480
so you propose some extension to t1

1056
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,720
white

1057
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,800
which is a non-standard and it's only

1058
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,279
informational

1059
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,920
and you propose something to stamp

1060
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
when all that can be addressed with one

1061
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,559
mechanism

1062
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,079
as i pointed out in my comments

1063
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:26,800
uh using multi-part message extension to

1064
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,800
icmp

1065
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,839
and another thing that i wanted to note

1066
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,839
is that

1067
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,880
you haven't

1068
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:47,200
responded to most of my comments

1069
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,680
that i send in attachments on my ppm

1070
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,919
list so i'm looking forward to hear from

1071
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,919
you

1072
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,880
and just to save time that will be it so

1073
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,439
i would like to move this

1074
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,160
uh discussion of my comments to the

1075
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,160
mailing list

1076
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,079
do i respond now or you want me to

1077
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,640
respond on the mailing list

1078
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,480
i i think that just for the sake of

1079
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,480
saving time for everybody we can

1080
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,480
continue discussion on the mailing list

1081
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,200
the only thing is that just to say that

1082
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,480
i have responded to

1083
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,480
the emails as an attachment i think

1084
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,400
the questions were in the word document

1085
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,359
while the responses are in the

1086
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,400
attached email format but i have replied

1087
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,240
to all your emails

1088
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,079
you're required to emails but not to

1089
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,399
comments

1090
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,160
no there's yeah it's the same whatever

1091
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,400
comments you had in the word documents

1092
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,399
were in the emails i went through it

1093
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,559
and i replied them as an email

1094
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,640
attachments to them

1095
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,720
if i can convert them into word document

1096
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,960
and send it to where it helps but

1097
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:02,240
i have replied there to your comments

1098
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:05,680
okay uh please uh send them uh so that

1099
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,720
um ippm working group because

1100
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:12,078
uh again because this uh two documents

1101
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,520
uh actually like two pairs of documents

1102
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,640
being discussed on both

1103
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,599
uh spring and ippm lists

1104
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,040
uh i'm not sure that everybody in ippm

1105
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,000
list

1106
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,599
group are reading a spring working group

1107
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,480
discussion

1108
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,040
no i have replied to this ippm working

1109
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,800
group

1110
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,640
email as attachment email attachments

1111
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,000
with all the

1112
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,000
comments or answers for your comments

1113
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,280
so please do look at it it should be in

1114
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,920
dark yeah

1115
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,319
yeah i will okay i'll look in archive

1116
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,520
but

1117
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:47,520
i i haven't seen it

1118
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,440
all on the list um and we also have

1119
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,279
martin in the queue

1120
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,280
martin do you want to speak up

1121
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,800
uh thank you rakesh for the presentation

1122
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,640
i um

1123
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,920
uh i read this for the first time a few

1124
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,240
days ago and i

1125
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,599
was really trying to understand uh the

1126
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,598
motivation for this work

1127
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,280
and honestly i had a lot of trouble

1128
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,839
getting that out of the

1129
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,280
the introduction um and some of that is

1130
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,240
what greg was saying about

1131
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,280
you know what what a tijuan party does

1132
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,759
and so on

1133
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,440
but like so if i understand correctly

1134
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,760
direct mode loss measurement

1135
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,599
means that there is something counting

1136
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,480
losses in the network you're trying to

1137
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,440
query it

1138
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,559
rather than measure it directly with the

1139
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,480
with the

1140
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:41,280
tiwa packet is that correct

1141
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,119
yeah so t1 allows the synthetic loss but

1142
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,520
what we're collecting the counters

1143
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,520
is the actual customer data traffic

1144
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,880
okay um that's interesting um

1145
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,960
it's it's very much conceptually

1146
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,559
different from what i perceive a lot of

1147
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,319
iptm stuff to be which is like

1148
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,559
measurement techniques

1149
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,000
to like say that you know to say that

1150
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,520
there's already a device doing this

1151
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,680
measurement we're just trying to like

1152
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,040
extract it from the

1153
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,040
device is um

1154
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,839
like why not just use http or something

1155
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,839
to get that

1156
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,680
yeah so we already have the t-wamp like

1157
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,040
machinery

1158
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:25,200
which collects timestamps today and uh

1159
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,640
and hoping the whole thing just to

1160
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,439
collect the counters from tx and rxi

1161
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:36,640
uh this has been done uh in like

1162
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:40,000
y1732 or rfc6374

1163
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:42,160
so there are precedence of this

1164
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,200
hardware capabilities that exist for the

1165
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,200
counters

1166
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,240
the hardware capabilities that exist for

1167
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,839
t1

1168
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,959
so there is a lot of motivation to uh

1169
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,200
add these small extensions and

1170
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,640
for segment routing use cases where we

1171
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,319
are measuring

1172
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:03,279
uh the actual customer traffic uh

1173
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:05,440
this this is a a very good um

1174
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,559
application for it

1175
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,800
okay uh fair enough um

1176
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,400
i i i i hope that between my comments

1177
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,680
and greg's maybe some ideas and how you

1178
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,720
could flush out at least like the

1179
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,960
introduction of this

1180
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,200
document a little more just to sort of

1181
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,880
say what prob exactly is being solved

1182
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,000
and maybe not get too deep into like

1183
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,440
spring

1184
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,160
terminology for people who aren't

1185
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,440
familiar with it thank you

1186
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,799
yeah for sure

1187
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,559
all right so it looks like we've trained

1188
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,160
the queue

1189
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:38,079
um you know

1190
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,920
on the call for adoption we've had a lot

1191
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,400
of good

1192
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,760
support from a number of people but i

1193
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,920
think that's also

1194
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
due to it being cross-listed in the work

1195
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,240
with spring

1196
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,800
um the comments that greg

1197
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,879
and martin bring up are very good what i

1198
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,319
would like to hear more of

1199
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,240
um is comments and reviews

1200
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,599
and thoughts on these particular issues

1201
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,919
from you know some of the ippm

1202
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,640
um working group members who did a lot

1203
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,000
of work

1204
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:12,480
on t amp and stamp

1205
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,839
and the design and the kind of original

1206
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,000
discussions around those and

1207
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:17,520
to comment on kind of the

1208
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,119
appropriateness of this or

1209
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,319
really what is the right way to solve

1210
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,319
these problems um

1211
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,480
so i can repeat that on the list as well

1212
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:29,119
but

1213
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,599
you know this is a call to get kind of

1214
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,400
more

1215
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:35,839
input in higher level review like that

1216
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,839
and greg did you want to say something

1217
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:43,920
as i noted in my uh review comments

1218
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,280
uh this proposal and a com and a similar

1219
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,799
proposal on

1220
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,079
stem does look like uh it defines

1221
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:54,720
a new protocol um and

1222
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,480
that's actually reflected in the slides

1223
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,598
that this is a standalone

1224
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,559
functionality so it's not an integral

1225
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,839
part

1226
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:06,960
of keywomp test

1227
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:10,319
or stamp because it defines

1228
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,599
a different format for the base message

1229
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:16,960
so it's not an extension of at least

1230
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,160
stamp and t1 but it's a new

1231
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:23,040
protocol and it should be viewed

1232
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,680
as a new protocol that does only one

1233
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,960
thing

1234
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,960
collects counters

1235
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:35,330
that's all thank you all right

1236
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,160
um

1237
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:40,640
[Music]

1238
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,440
so i think it's time to move on for this

1239
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,440
one

1240
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,119
thanks again everyone for your comments

1241
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,839
and we'll try to

1242
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,839
follow up with a good summary on the

1243
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,839
list

1244
00:55:50,079 --> 00:56:03,839
i think next we have rigor

1245
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:16,078
ippm connectivity monitoring uh

1246
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,279
third version i applied for adaption at

1247
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,920
the work

1248
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,079
and this was actually running the scope

1249
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,720
is uh

1250
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,200
monitoring second routed subpath or

1251
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,439
links

1252
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,399
and to detect and locate loss of

1253
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,000
connectivity

1254
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:36,240
and congestion and that's the value add

1255
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,440
detecting the location of congestion

1256
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,558
which is enabled

1257
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:44,160
if this draft is supported

1258
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,480
it's a based and only work with mphs

1259
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,520
segment routing i'm not sure but it

1260
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,559
could work with

1261
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:54,960
ipv6 segment routing too so

1262
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:59,920
properties is monitor network sections

1263
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,920
with known topology not unknown ones

1264
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:06,720
one measurement path uh monitored link

1265
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:07,680
that is important the design is so that

1266
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,160
you

1267
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,480
roughly have the same functionality as

1268
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:17,200
if you work with a

1269
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:19,440
ping and uh yep

1270
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,359
there is one important issue change

1271
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,440
point detection doesn't require well

1272
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:28,319
synchronized timestamps so it's a

1273
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,319
differentiating matrix metric

1274
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,240
and it applies segment routing to allow

1275
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,640
for an

1276
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,839
a prior design network tamography

1277
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,960
evaluation

1278
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,319
and a limited number of monitoring

1279
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,720
systems so it's uh

1280
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,680
important you do not have to work on

1281
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,640
routers

1282
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,440
you can work on routers so it's just

1283
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,720
depending on

1284
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,720
what you want to use it for

1285
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,640
and it does uh estimate uh round-trip

1286
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,440
delays and

1287
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,640
one-way delays of monitored links or

1288
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,160
path

1289
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:07,040
as it is designed uh right here

1290
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,279
and um yeah the aim is to standardize a

1291
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,079
suitable metrics

1292
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,640
and as i mentioned it's a tomography

1293
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:15,520
approach

1294
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,520
next slide please

1295
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:23,839
so this is shown here in the slide

1296
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,160
i do not want to go to details uh

1297
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,880
but you need to be relatively strict in

1298
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,920
setting up

1299
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,359
paths like shown here and

1300
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:36,240
uh i think that should be done uh in an

1301
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,440
automated fashion if you run it out on a

1302
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,439
larger scale

1303
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,400
but this is not part of the draft the

1304
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:46,000
draft is only dealing with the

1305
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:49,040
methodology and the metric

1306
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
right the important thing is every

1307
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,480
measurement path

1308
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,359
is set up as shown above you have one

1309
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,680
u-loop

1310
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,160
you have one downlink measurement one

1311
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,160
uplink

1312
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,160
and below you see that on each measured

1313
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,319
path

1314
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,319
you have pretty much the same mix of

1315
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,160
three different paths

1316
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,480
or the green one is the uplink one the

1317
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:14,078
blue one is the u loop and the red one

1318
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:18,240
is the downlink one and if you do that

1319
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:21,359
you can evaluate the signals

1320
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:24,720
have a non-ambiguous indication

1321
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:26,558
of whether there is connectivity and

1322
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,480
whether there is congestion and if there

1323
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,160
is congestion you also are able to

1324
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,280
identify

1325
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,680
the interface where there is congestion

1326
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,839
so this is a difference to a ping where

1327
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,480
you do not know exactly where the

1328
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,558
congestion is located because you cannot

1329
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,359
differentiate that so that's the value

1330
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,400
add of

1331
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:48,799
this contribution

1332
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,160
all right i don't want to go to details

1333
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,880
uh if you have time

1334
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,359
read the slide it roughly tells you what

1335
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,280
to do

1336
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,040
i received questions during the

1337
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,160
discussion on the list

1338
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,279
and these were related to the temporal

1339
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,480
resolution of

1340
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,400
event detection so uh

1341
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,760
there is a little text and the draft the

1342
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,160
text on this slide is

1343
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,359
likely uh a bit larger and the

1344
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,640
illustration is more

1345
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:18,078
better if you space all the measurement

1346
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:21,200
packets by some tpd

1347
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:24,319
then i think it's a conservative and

1348
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:28,078
fair guess that you will be able to

1349
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:32,720
detect events of a duration of more than

1350
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:35,839
two times tpd or longer

1351
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:39,040
now uh as you see in the figure that

1352
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:43,440
all the packets of all flows are

1353
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:47,200
having the same uh periodical uh

1354
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:50,400
distance uh measurement interval and um

1355
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,839
so that i think is quite straightforward

1356
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,119
i just made up my mind and think if

1357
01:00:53,839 --> 01:01:00,480
you are working on a time scale which is

1358
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,920
much smaller than the path as you detect

1359
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,680
then

1360
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,680
you might be able to work with

1361
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:15,599
temporal properties uh i just see that

1362
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,598
i was hard to hear and

1363
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,480
but i didn't think that through so this

1364
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,040
is a a

1365
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,400
quite simple answer and that tells you

1366
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,440
what can be done

1367
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:30,799
the aim is not to replace any

1368
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,960
uh hello messages which are exchanged

1369
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:35,440
directly on a link with neighbors

1370
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,079
the aim is to monitor networks on a time

1371
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,760
scale

1372
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:43,119
maybe seconds uh maybe minutes and uh

1373
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,960
just uh be aware where you're forwarding

1374
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,680
doesn't work because that is what this

1375
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,160
draft do

1376
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,000
there is no interaction with routers

1377
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:56,078
it's only measuring on

1378
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,079
uh forwarding paths all right and that

1379
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,399
was the presentation if you are

1380
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:04,160
interested read the draft and

1381
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,839
support adaption i don't know whether

1382
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,480
this should be discussed here i don't

1383
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:09,440
know how big

1384
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,640
the segment routing mpls segment routing

1385
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,119
know how of this

1386
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:14,558
work group is here so i didn't try to

1387
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,359
present it in

1388
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,359
segment routing yet if there is a

1389
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,400
sentiment that i should do so please let

1390
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:24,240
me know

1391
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,240
thanks are there any questions

1392
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,720
greg's in the queue uh greg do you want

1393
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,720
to go

1394
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:38,000
it's a very good interesting work and

1395
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,119
a lot of interest i have to it i just

1396
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,960
wanted to note

1397
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:46,640
that if you see the scale

1398
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:50,160
of detection in terms of

1399
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:53,520
seconds or even 100 milliseconds

1400
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,879
uh that might be um

1401
01:02:53,520 --> 01:03:00,559
uh too long period because if we'll take

1402
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,920
um local protection

1403
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:08,880
um like trl tray

1404
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:08,880
that will work on um

1405
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:15,200
10 milliseconds interval so

1406
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,480
um there are local protection there a

1407
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:20,319
defect that is

1408
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:23,440
uh locally detected between two nodes

1409
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:25,440
would not be noticed so i

1410
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:27,680
i think that that's something important

1411
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:31,680
uh to really take into account

1412
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:34,879
that we might have a local switchover

1413
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:37,759
and reroute of the path and the system

1414
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,760
would not notice

1415
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,879
i'm not sure if it changes

1416
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,000
the forwarding pattern and you measure

1417
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,039
different times

1418
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,880
then you will notice that if you

1419
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:56,480
are looking at the situation of a bundle

1420
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:59,039
then it might go unnoticed i agree

1421
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,839
but then that depends on what you want

1422
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,039
to measure

1423
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:06,960
i had a conversation uh

1424
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:10,079
with uh someone else who tried to

1425
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:12,160
suggest it to monitor end-to-end paths

1426
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,760
and then that's something completely

1427
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:16,078
different

1428
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,319
so there are multiple opportunities

1429
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:21,039
where you could use that

1430
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,359
and it just depends on what you want to

1431
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,680
do

1432
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:24,640
with it i but as i mentioned i do not

1433
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,960
want to

1434
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,960
i do not suggest to use it

1435
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,760
as a replacement of hello messages

1436
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,839
because that is

1437
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,000
that is too much of a research issue to

1438
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,000
me

1439
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:43,038
okay let's continue on the list thank

1440
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:46,160
you i appreciate it thank you

1441
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:55,839
okay thanks uh

1442
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:55,839
jay you're next up

1443
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:12,960
you might need to reconnect audio it's

1444
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,959
in the lower right

1445
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,799
all right um yeah so we're not hearing

1446
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:26,000
from you

1447
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,000
jose ignacio um

1448
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,240
if you want to unmute please do

1449
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,160
otherwise i think

1450
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,160
you don't have any other people in queue

1451
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,598
yeah so we haven't gotten a lot of

1452
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,280
feedback on the list on this one

1453
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:42,720
um thank you al for sending your

1454
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,760
comments and

1455
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,279
um greg if you'd like to

1456
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,799
kind of reply on the list that would be

1457
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,280
great as well

1458
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,440
i would ask that we get a few more

1459
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,400
people um

1460
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,520
reviewing this document and commenting

1461
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,880
whether or not they think it should be

1462
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,960
adopted

1463
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,960
um before we move on but um

1464
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,559
otherwise that's good thank you so much

1465
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,879
berger

1466
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,880
thanks

1467
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:13,119
all right

1468
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:20,558
next we have iom conf state

1469
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:33,839
document

1470
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:48,160
okay uh hello it's xiaomi speaking

1471
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:51,280
this presentation is uh

1472
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,598
echo request reply for enabled in-situ

1473
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,680
oem capabilities

1474
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:59,280
i've presented the earlier versions of

1475
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,000
this job to the previous ietf meetings

1476
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,599
and this time i present the 0 7 version

1477
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,480
of this chart

1478
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,480
next slide please

1479
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,400
firstly i want to recap the intention of

1480
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,960
this job

1481
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,000
this job provides a method for the iom

1482
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,359
encapsulation

1483
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,160
of encapsulating load to discover the

1484
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:28,400
enabled

1485
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:31,200
iom capabilities of the downstream nodes

1486
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,319
the method is more useful when there is

1487
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:36,720
no centralized

1488
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:39,038
controller within the iom domain

1489
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,879
in this scenario the ion encapsulating

1490
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,760
node cannot

1491
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,640
construct the iom header by a

1492
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:47,039
configuration

1493
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,118
or by querying the centralized

1494
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,760
controller

1495
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:54,480
in other words the method is a

1496
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,839
complementary iom tool

1497
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,520
it may not cover all iom deployment

1498
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:02,480
scenarios

1499
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,240
but it makes iom deployment more

1500
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:11,839
flexible

1501
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:11,839
next slide please

1502
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:21,120
next slide okay

1503
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,640
since 01 version of this job we've had a

1504
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,439
good discussion

1505
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,239
within the working group and many good

1506
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,519
comments

1507
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:32,158
have been received here i list some

1508
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:34,480
major updates from them

1509
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:35,679
we adjust the title and scope of this

1510
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,399
job

1511
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,640
to make the intention more apparent and

1512
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:43,358
more accurate

1513
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:45,839
firstly among the title iom

1514
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:48,880
configuration data is changed to

1515
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:52,318
enabled iom capabilities

1516
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:56,560
since the former is too associated with

1517
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:59,759
netconf and yang secondly

1518
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:04,719
three use cases identified

1519
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:07,600
they are ipv6 mpos and sfc

1520
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,319
and this method is partitionally

1521
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,159
restricted

1522
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:15,920
to explicit path whether strict

1523
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:18,238
or loose thirdly

1524
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,520
in the current chart we don't provide

1525
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:24,000
specific

1526
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:27,759
anna requests for icmp v6

1527
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:29,759
svp or sfc ping

1528
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,198
we asked for guidance from the working

1529
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,719
group chairs

1530
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:37,839
on whether to include them in this job

1531
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:40,399
or in separate drafts next

1532
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,399
slide please

1533
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:54,960
since still one version of this draft

1534
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:57,760
the defined tv sub tvs are reclassified

1535
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,760
and we adjust the relevant tov sub tv

1536
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,880
definition

1537
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,800
accurate test and echo replied tuvs

1538
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:10,159
are divided into two separate sections

1539
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:10,960
list of sub-tuvs is removed from the

1540
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,839
echo request

1541
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:18,000
tov tracing capabilities

1542
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,320
sub-tuv is divided into

1543
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,840
pre-allocated tracing capabilities

1544
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,559
subtle v

1545
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,400
and incremental tracing capabilities sub

1546
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:31,520
to v

1547
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:34,559
at the same time f bit is removed

1548
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:39,760
and the egress mtu field is

1549
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,760
extended from 14 bits to 16 bits

1550
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:45,840
next slide please

1551
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:56,159
some technical changes have been made

1552
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,480
to follow the updated iom data draft

1553
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:01,199
and this operational guide section has

1554
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:05,440
been enhanced

1555
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:09,040
firstly list of namespace ids field

1556
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:12,400
is added into echo request tov

1557
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:15,519
and the respective namespace id

1558
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,080
is added into respective echo reply

1559
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:21,120
subtly

1560
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:24,159
secondly iom trace type

1561
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:28,159
field is extended from

1562
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:32,320
16 bits to 24 bits

1563
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:35,599
thirdly in operational guide section

1564
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:38,840
we add one alternative for the iom

1565
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,040
encapsulating node to send an echo

1566
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:45,440
request to each iom

1567
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:49,199
transit or decapsulating node directly

1568
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:55,839
without the ttl expiration

1569
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:55,839
next slide please

1570
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:05,679
following the newly adopted iom direct

1571
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:10,400
export draft and iom

1572
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:15,040
dx capabilities sub tube is added

1573
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:19,839
this subuv includes iom trace type field

1574
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,840
and namespace id view

1575
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:28,640
except for the updates i just presented

1576
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:32,719
we've also received a good comments

1577
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:35,040
from uh drove study before this meeting

1578
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:36,080
and the updates on addressing these good

1579
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:39,199
comments will be

1580
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:41,440
included in the next revision of this

1581
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:44,320
chapter

1582
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,320
next slide please

1583
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:55,440
next steps this job is in

1584
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:59,199
uh call for adoption currently we are

1585
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:04,159
looking forward to the conclusion

1586
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:06,239
that's all thank you

1587
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,519
all right thank you very much do you

1588
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,320
have any comments or

1589
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,320
questions

1590
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:19,839
martin dickson thank you good work

1591
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:26,000
we cannot hear you sorry martin you have

1592
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,000
this video

1593
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,679
and i'm not gonna like there we go okay

1594
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:31,360
sorry yeah this is there's a little

1595
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,440
latency in this um

1596
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:35,199
thank you xiao for the presentation um

1597
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,360
so am i understand that then

1598
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,559
every one of these echo requests

1599
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:43,839
generates and

1600
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,840
echo replies uh forever and advertising

1601
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,159
capabilities

1602
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,880
uh sorry it's not very clear to me

1603
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:55,040
so so mayana so if i understand

1604
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,640
correctly every echo request generates

1605
01:13:55,040 --> 01:14:00,320
multiple echo replies

1606
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:03,440
from each each hop in the network

1607
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:06,719
uh yes we can use ttl

1608
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,440
for the echo request so echo request

1609
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,480
that there are

1610
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:11,040
multiple account requests and every echo

1611
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,480
request

1612
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:15,920
generates one accuracy

1613
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:17,759
uh okay so it's there's not an

1614
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:22,000
amplification problem wonderful

1615
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:25,360
um have you considered possibly

1616
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,159
um if

1617
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,679
if the is it is is the desire here to

1618
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:32,159
figure out what is like the actual

1619
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:37,199
common set of capabilities that the

1620
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:39,280
entire path is able to support and if so

1621
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:40,719
could you not like have a essentially

1622
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,800
like a list of

1623
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,800
capabilities that is travels through the

1624
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,159
through the path and filters out the the

1625
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:49,760
capabilities that are not common it's

1626
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:51,839
like for instance

1627
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,280
hop one would say oh i can do ten

1628
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,000
different things

1629
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,320
and the hop two says i do eight of those

1630
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,239
uh

1631
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,759
and so then eliminates two of the fields

1632
01:14:58,239 --> 01:15:01,519
and so on until you end up with

1633
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,040
uh you know the five common things that

1634
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,960
the entire path uses so you could do it

1635
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:07,280
all on one message instead of

1636
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,199
a bunch or is that not what you're

1637
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:14,639
trying to achieve

1638
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:19,919
uh sorry it's hard it's not

1639
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:24,000
a career um because there's a noisy

1640
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:26,719
okay uh

1641
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,440
can answer martin's question okay

1642
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:31,280
correct

1643
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:34,320
can you help yes uh sorry to jump

1644
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:36,000
um well that

1645
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,679
is one of the scenarios that martin

1646
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,120
described so

1647
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:44,000
finding their lowest common denominator

1648
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:44,719
but at the same time the goal is just to

1649
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,679
learn

1650
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,800
the capabilities of each node and that

1651
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,800
can be used

1652
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:57,040
in some other scenarios

1653
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,040
okay thank you

1654
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:09,440
thank you yeah that's i think a question

1655
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,719
that i asked before so what we're

1656
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,320
basically doing here

1657
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:18,320
is we're adding management capability

1658
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:19,360
into icmp and other echo request

1659
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:22,799
protocols

1660
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:26,320
and i think the question is why

1661
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:29,120
because we could go and do the very same

1662
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:31,759
with netconvieng if you're just querying

1663
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:35,519
every single note right

1664
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:38,640
so why would we need that in icmp

1665
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:40,239
and if we do convert or if we believe we

1666
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,440
want to go and convert icmp into

1667
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:45,280
management

1668
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:45,280
and capability discovery protocol

1669
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,600
is ippm the right place to go and do

1670
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,000
that

1671
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,480
because well yes initially is done for

1672
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,640
iom

1673
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,000
but i think there is a broader question

1674
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:03,679
here that we should go and

1675
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:06,239
get results before we adopt it here

1676
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,440
uh thank you for firstly i don't think

1677
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,360
uh it's a

1678
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:15,199
management protocol because uh

1679
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:19,199
i have already explained the intention

1680
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:21,199
in page 2 of this slide

1681
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:22,320
the intention is for the iom

1682
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:26,559
encapsulation node

1683
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:30,080
to discover the capabilities

1684
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:33,360
and use these discovered capabilities to

1685
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:38,480
construct the iom header

1686
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:41,920
so i think um it it's more like a

1687
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,480
tool a complementary iom tour

1688
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,159
so i i don't think it's management

1689
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:49,759
specific

1690
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:53,199
uh secondly for the uh

1691
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,560
ippm working group uh whether or not

1692
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:58,799
ibpm is the appropriate

1693
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,440
working group for this work i think i

1694
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,080
have already um

1695
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,839
sent a sentence this question before and

1696
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,040
i think uh

1697
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:12,719
the the comments to my question is that

1698
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:15,440
this is iom specific so

1699
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:15,440
i need to

1700
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:25,040
present this chapter and get

1701
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:28,239
adopted in ippm before i can

1702
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:32,640
do any uh next actions next

1703
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:36,639
steps to actually i have already um

1704
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:38,640
said in my presentation that i asked for

1705
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,080
guidance from the working group chairs

1706
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,120
on whether to

1707
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:46,000
request ir requests in

1708
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:48,000
this job or in separate jobs in other

1709
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:55,600
working groups

1710
01:18:48,000 --> 01:19:00,239
so that's the intention

1711
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,239
thank you all right

1712
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,199
more people in queue should probably cut

1713
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:08,480
the cues after this

1714
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:12,000
welcome so i have a

1715
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,040
comment about it since the draft is try

1716
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,880
to extension to

1717
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:19,519
the uh icmp and the mtsp

1718
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,199
particle so i'm not sure this this is

1719
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,440
the right working group to program this

1720
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,440
work

1721
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,920
uh yes i have already uh explained to

1722
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,520
frank

1723
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,679
so i think it's

1724
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,560
i asked for uh guidance from working

1725
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,840
group chairs

1726
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,840
on this

1727
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,480
okay okay thank you

1728
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:56,239
extremely

1729
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,239
if you're speaking we cannot hear oh

1730
01:19:58,239 --> 01:20:02,639
hi guys okay

1731
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:10,239
one comment like uh can this

1732
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,199
mechanism to be used in like multi

1733
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:14,159
domains or

1734
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,960
basically something like this because

1735
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:18,239
like

1736
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:21,760
by using the icmp i think it can

1737
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:24,400
like get information of the nodes

1738
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,239
from other domains but i think it will

1739
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:30,000
introduce some security

1740
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:33,839
considerations issues like

1741
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,840
what do you think about this

1742
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:40,639
uh for the specific security

1743
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,480
issues or where we can discuss it

1744
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:45,600
further on the main list

1745
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,638
so if you can find some security issues

1746
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:52,880
i think uh welcome uh to

1747
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:55,280
comment on the mini list okay thanks

1748
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,280
thank you

1749
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,120
all right thank you and just to kind of

1750
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:04,159
reiterate that

1751
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:06,639
point um any of these comments um

1752
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:08,159
particularly the ones that are raising

1753
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:10,960
some concerns

1754
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:11,599
uh please do reply to the awkward option

1755
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,679
for

1756
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,159
that um i don't think i've seen a lot of

1757
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:21,520
those on that particular thread

1758
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:21,519
so please do chime in all right

1759
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,519
thank you so much i think it's time to

1760
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,840
move on

1761
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,840
okay thank you tommy thank you

1762
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,799
all right and lastly of our documents

1763
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,760
that we're considering for adoption we

1764
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:43,199
have

1765
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:46,719
the irm yang document

1766
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:52,559
hello hello okay

1767
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:52,560
yeah your audio is extremely quiet

1768
01:21:53,440 --> 01:22:00,480
can you hear me

1769
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:04,320
please speak up oh so

1770
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,320
okay hear me no

1771
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,839
yeah okay

1772
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,840
yeah let's go ahead let yeah

1773
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,440
and this is about the yandere model for

1774
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:39,840
iom

1775
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:39,839
this next slide

1776
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:49,520
next please oh yeah

1777
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:53,199
and this this draft was

1778
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:57,600
initially posted on march 2018

1779
01:22:53,199 --> 01:23:00,400
and presented on 191 wow 2 and 108

1780
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,960
we got comments from greg richard tom

1781
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:04,480
and

1782
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:07,280
roof thanks all for your comments

1783
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,638
we have evolved several versions to

1784
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,320
align with the latest

1785
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,760
iom data draft and the iom directory

1786
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:17,360
support draft

1787
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:21,280
and the latest version corrected the

1788
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:24,320
admin type scenes as suggested by tom

1789
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:27,599
including the reference copyright tree

1790
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:30,880
diagram and the correct

1791
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,000
reference of the proof of transit and so

1792
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:35,760
on

1793
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:38,239
and after we submit submitted this slide

1794
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:40,480
we received two more detailed comments

1795
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:44,000
from the roof and the russian

1796
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:44,638
um not updated this slide but i will

1797
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,560
discuss

1798
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:50,880
this later next

1799
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,880
slide

1800
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:58,320
the model structure is like this the

1801
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:02,239
model is organized

1802
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,120
as a list of profiles as suggested by

1803
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:07,360
the working group

1804
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:10,080
each profile container is enabled by

1805
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,480
by the corresponding features so the

1806
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:16,559
device do not need to support

1807
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:17,040
all the features each profile associates

1808
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,239
with

1809
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:21,360
one flow and the corresponding iom

1810
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:24,959
information

1811
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:28,839
the flow is typically identified by pcl

1812
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:32,480
and can be identifi uh defined

1813
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,120
flexibly um we support five profiles

1814
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:34,959
here

1815
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,800
the incremental tracing the

1816
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,080
pre-allocated tracing

1817
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:43,840
the director export proof of transit

1818
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:44,960
and the end to end multiple iom data

1819
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:48,880
types can be

1820
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:51,920
encapsulated into the same ion header

1821
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:55,679
the latest comments i read from the roof

1822
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:58,960
is to make this model more flexible and

1823
01:24:55,679 --> 01:25:01,520
reusable in other words

1824
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,040
one profile could apply to different

1825
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,880
protocol layers

1826
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:12,320
and apply to different flows if we wanna

1827
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:17,280
if we want to do this what to do so

1828
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:19,840
one profile could apply to different

1829
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,639
women need to women need to decouple the

1830
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,760
flow

1831
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:23,760
and protocol

1832
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,199
and that the protocol decouple the flow

1833
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:33,360
the protocol and

1834
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:37,280
the i1 profile

1835
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:42,639
and so that we can flexibly

1836
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:47,120
compose them um here i want to know your

1837
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:54,320
opinion in this working group

1838
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:57,199
do we have this requirement

1839
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:00,960
and of course we can continue and

1840
01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:00,960
discuss this in the mail list

1841
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:07,919
and another question is do we

1842
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:11,760
allow all options for one flow at

1843
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:14,800
the same time i think the answer is

1844
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:17,840
partially yes for tracing

1845
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:20,960
an end-to-end option yes

1846
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,239
for incremental tracing and allocated

1847
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:26,239
tracing

1848
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:29,919
i do not think there's there's any case

1849
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:38,480
on this so maybe we may need some

1850
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:38,480
more strict rule here and next

1851
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:52,480
um the the pre-allocated tracing

1852
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,920
option will create pre-allocated space

1853
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:58,159
for each node to

1854
01:26:53,920 --> 01:27:04,560
populate its information the structure

1855
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:07,599
is as follows and the next

1856
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:11,360
and this is the incremental tracing

1857
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:11,360
profile and next

1858
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:19,360
and the director export option is used

1859
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,799
is used as a trigger for iom node to

1860
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,559
export

1861
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:27,199
data to a receiving entity

1862
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,199
and next

1863
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:36,080
the i1 proof of transit data is to

1864
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:38,880
support the pass

1865
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:40,000
or service function chain verification

1866
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,440
use cases

1867
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,639
it's imported from the draft in

1868
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:50,239
sfc working group richard made this

1869
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:54,400
latest comments made the latest

1870
01:27:50,239 --> 01:27:57,759
comments on this so one discussion is

1871
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:01,120
whether we should incorporate the

1872
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:05,040
parts directly in this i1

1873
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:08,400
model or still like this we import

1874
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:15,840
it from the sfc

1875
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:15,839
and in comments here

1876
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,840
the next

1877
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:32,638
and the iron edge to edge option is to

1878
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:36,239
carry data that is added by the

1879
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:40,800
iom encapsulation encapsulating node

1880
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:43,839
and interpreted by the decal range node

1881
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,840
and next

1882
01:28:45,199 --> 01:28:49,599
that's all and any more comments

1883
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:56,080
thanks for all the comments that's

1884
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:58,480
received to the end of the list

1885
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:59,199
thank you it looks at this point that

1886
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,638
there isn't

1887
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:04,080
anyone in the queue someone speaks up

1888
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:06,000
now

1889
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,840
and we did get a lot of good feedback on

1890
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,159
the list so thank you for everyone who

1891
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,159
did respond there

1892
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:17,199
all right so yeah thank you for your

1893
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:20,559
presentation

1894
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:25,839
and um we'll get back on the list about

1895
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,840
the status for adoption

1896
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,480
thank you so much thank you thank you

1897
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,840
all

1898
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:53,520
all right so now

1899
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:56,400
we're going to go on to the um

1900
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,440
documents that are not in current call

1901
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,280
for adoption

1902
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:01,040
and actually i was expecting that we

1903
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:05,120
would have the

1904
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:08,159
hybrid two step

1905
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,840
next um

1906
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:11,920
i may have thrown the slides slightly

1907
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:15,520
out of order

1908
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:18,719
all right yeah apologies

1909
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:19,440
or actually um i don't know if it

1910
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:23,600
matters

1911
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,559
too much um if tomorrow's already ready

1912
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,320
oh

1913
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:30,800
okay let's keep the agenda as it was and

1914
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,159
uh take ten minutes to talk about the

1915
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,600
hyper2 step

1916
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:37,920
that's okay

1917
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,920
ready

1918
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:52,320
okay next slide please

1919
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,440
okay so we had a good discussion on the

1920
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:58,239
mailing list

1921
01:30:53,440 --> 01:31:02,638
and um edit um

1922
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:06,718
how uh hybrid two-step can use um iom

1923
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:10,159
or and alternate marking them domains

1924
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:11,120
and uh clarify their uh scenario of the

1925
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,239
late full

1926
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:15,519
packet so when their uh htc timer

1927
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:19,440
expires

1928
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:22,239
and we welcome how you uh as a call for

1929
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,239
uh netflix

1930
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:34,719
so the telemetry uh

1931
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,719
can be viewed as a

1932
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:41,840
union of three tasks uh generating

1933
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,679
telemetry information um

1934
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,960
collecting transporting telemetry

1935
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:49,360
information and then

1936
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:52,400
correlating telemetry information

1937
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:56,080
we are working on a

1938
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:59,839
number of solutions to their

1939
01:31:56,080 --> 01:32:00,480
telemetry and that includes uh iem trace

1940
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:04,159
options

1941
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:07,759
and uh when their information

1942
01:32:04,159 --> 01:32:09,360
is uh collected and transported in the

1943
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:12,880
data packet itself

1944
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:16,159
and uh the trace option can have

1945
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:19,199
two uh sub uh variances

1946
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:22,000
uh pre-allocated and incremental

1947
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:23,040
then we have a direct export which

1948
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,639
combines

1949
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:30,239
um uh the proposal that um

1950
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,800
postcard based elementary i uh there is

1951
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:33,919
a

1952
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:38,239
postcard based telemetry

1953
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:42,080
m which uses uh as a trigger

1954
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:42,718
method of packet marking for example as

1955
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,800
the

1956
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:51,520
described in rfc 8321

1957
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:54,320
so um in

1958
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,280
direct export or marking so the

1959
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:59,199
difference only

1960
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:59,199
in what triggers the information

1961
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:07,040
generation their

1962
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:07,040
method of each node

1963
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:13,120
collects the information and then uh

1964
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:17,199
transported to their collector

1965
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:20,480
uh using a um out of band

1966
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:23,120
packet so out of band in terms of

1967
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:24,159
relative to the data flow which

1968
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:29,440
generated

1969
01:33:24,159 --> 01:33:29,440
this telemetry information next slide

1970
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:41,360
so each of these methods that we're

1971
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:44,080
pretty much well familiar with uh has

1972
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:45,280
some advantages but at the same time

1973
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,840
challenges

1974
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:51,440
so the hybrid two step um

1975
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,159
is a method that

1976
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:55,519
is complementary to all the method that

1977
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:58,879
i mentioned

1978
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,520
and it uses their specially constructed

1979
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,600
message

1980
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:07,280
a follow-up message to collect telemetry

1981
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:10,800
and transport it along the same path

1982
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:14,320
as was followed by their uh packet

1983
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:16,639
that triggered their telemetry

1984
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:20,159
information

1985
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:22,000
so um since the trigger packet is a

1986
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:24,159
network layer specific

1987
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,360
the follow-up packet uses the same

1988
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:28,638
encapsulation

1989
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:32,559
so to ensure that it follows the same

1990
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:37,760
path but um

1991
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:37,760
the method can be flexible so that

1992
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:43,119
hybrid could follow a packet is out of

1993
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,119
band

1994
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:46,719
even though it follows the same

1995
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:49,599
topological path

1996
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:50,400
but because it would not necessarily

1997
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,440
share

1998
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:56,400
the same qis so

1999
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,040
it would not really take the resources

2000
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,960
especially

2001
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:05,840
which is for services that are sensitive

2002
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:09,280
uh to latency jitter and packet laws

2003
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:15,119
so in a way it uses their

2004
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:18,800
management plan um so

2005
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:22,239
uh another um quality of

2006
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:25,360
uh hybrid two-step proposal is that

2007
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:28,000
uh there is no limitation of how

2008
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,960
of amount of information collected along

2009
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,280
the path

2010
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:36,080
because um any transit node

2011
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:37,519
would be capable or required to be

2012
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:42,159
capable

2013
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:45,119
to generate additional follow-up packet

2014
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:48,239
using the same encapsulation as their

2015
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:48,239
original data pack

2016
01:35:48,800 --> 01:36:00,400
next slide please

2017
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:03,520
um so this is outlines their uh

2018
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:06,239
proposed uh format a follow-up packet

2019
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,199
um the transport network encapsulation

2020
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:10,559
which is

2021
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:13,919
should be identical to the one

2022
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,719
that used for a layer specific

2023
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,920
trigger packet and then uh information

2024
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:22,000
that is required

2025
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,400
for identification of uh the flow

2026
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,280
uh the sequence number it's a sequence

2027
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,960
number in

2028
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:32,559
a queue of

2029
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:35,840
um follow-up objects that are

2030
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:38,159
triggered by the same uh data packet

2031
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,440
and then telemetry information uh

2032
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:44,080
organized as a tovs

2033
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,080
next slide

2034
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:53,360
so here uh it's in the illustration how

2035
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:53,760
their method of collecting transporting

2036
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:56,960
their

2037
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,440
telemetry information uh works uh

2038
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,119
we have a flow of data packets then

2039
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,960
there is a trigger packet

2040
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:08,320
which um produces

2041
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:09,679
uh the follow-up packet and uh follow-up

2042
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,480
packet

2043
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:14,639
the original for packet may be uh filled

2044
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:19,199
with their telemetry information

2045
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:22,000
then uh their transit note in this

2046
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,559
diagram it's a node c can generate

2047
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,639
another

2048
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,600
additional follow-up packet and then

2049
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:29,199
they will arrive

2050
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,880
at the egress node which will uh

2051
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:33,678
remove them from the network because

2052
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,280
it's a destination of

2053
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:38,639
the data packet and then the information

2054
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:42,480
can be

2055
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:46,080
analyzed or sent for the processing

2056
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:48,879
the advantage of it is that

2057
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,559
it's easy to correlate because all the

2058
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,020
information like

2059
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,639
um

2060
01:37:52,020 --> 01:37:58,480
[Music]

2061
01:37:54,639 --> 01:38:03,840
iom trace options collected together

2062
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:03,839
uh next slide

2063
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:13,280
so the previous diagram shows uh

2064
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:16,320
how um hybrid to step method works in a

2065
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:19,599
point-to-point case

2066
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,639
it works uh in a multicast distribution

2067
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,000
tree as well

2068
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,679
and that's um works efficiently because

2069
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,719
there is no replication

2070
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:31,600
of telemetry information um

2071
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:34,080
so i would not go uh through this uh you

2072
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:37,440
can read the draft or

2073
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:40,639
bring the question on the list but

2074
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:44,080
the diagram shows that only their

2075
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:47,440
um information of the

2076
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:50,320
sub multicast sub 3 is collected

2077
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:51,759
in a follow-up packet so the information

2078
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,799
that was collected

2079
01:38:51,760 --> 01:39:00,239
upstream is not replicated

2080
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,239
on all their uh branches

2081
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,159
next slide

2082
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:14,400
so iom can be used

2083
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:14,960
uh with a hybrid uh two-step method of

2084
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,960
collecting

2085
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:22,239
information and um

2086
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:24,239
we added a description of how uh what

2087
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:28,879
information from their

2088
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:31,759
uh i header can be used uh to trigger

2089
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:34,239
and how this information can be

2090
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,960
encapsulated

2091
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,959
into their

2092
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:45,040
payload of follow-up packet

2093
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:48,480
so uh that's an intention of

2094
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:52,080
using their uh information defined

2095
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:54,559
in iem data

2096
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:55,840
but encapsulating in tovs for

2097
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,040
flexibility

2098
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,040
uh next slide please

2099
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,960
so uh we are looking for a for comments

2100
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:09,119
discussion on the list

2101
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:12,320
and uh very encouraged by their

2102
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:17,519
uh thought of adopting this work

2103
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:20,159
at some point thank you

2104
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,159
thank you greg

2105
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,840
do you have any questions

2106
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,879
comments

2107
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:39,380
um

2108
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,960
hi um i'm

2109
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:43,760
[Music]

2110
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,159
wondering if that's actually this work

2111
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,199
uh

2112
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:50,400
is actually in scope for ippm because it

2113
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:51,119
somehow rather defines an entirely new

2114
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:54,638
protocol

2115
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:57,119
than like a metric or model or whatever

2116
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,560
um so that should definitely be

2117
01:40:57,119 --> 01:41:01,360
discussed before starting working group

2118
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:04,639
adoption i think

2119
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:08,000
um okay thank you again

2120
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:11,040
um it's um

2121
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:12,800
what's being proposed here is not that

2122
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,280
different from the direct

2123
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,280
expert

2124
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:22,159
method because direct expert

2125
01:41:20,159 --> 01:41:24,799
generates packet with the telemetry

2126
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:27,519
information from each transit node

2127
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:28,080
and hybrid two-step takes it a little

2128
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,360
bit

2129
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:34,559
differently and combines the methods in

2130
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:38,239
iem trace option and direct

2131
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:41,360
expert so um

2132
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:45,119
but that's something for working group

2133
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:48,239
shares and ad to decide but

2134
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:48,639
well appreciate their uh consideration

2135
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:51,919
and

2136
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:54,400
uh advice where this work can be

2137
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:54,400
anchored

2138
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,920
thanks for bringing that up i i think

2139
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,519
also

2140
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,080
there's a you know general question that

2141
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:09,440
this raises to me of um

2142
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,440
making sure that as we're doing

2143
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,040
the work such as direct export that we

2144
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,919
have a

2145
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,480
kind of good and consistent story and

2146
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,639
we're not

2147
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,080
um doing too much overlapping or

2148
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:21,920
conflicting

2149
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:24,320
work and to see how much can we unify

2150
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:29,840
these approaches

2151
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:29,840
all right

2152
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,719
okay it doesn't look like we have any

2153
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:40,000
loss in the queue so thank you greg

2154
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:40,000
now let's move back to move forward

2155
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,320
you got it okay

2156
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,960
oh do you want to come back on

2157
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:54,080
thank you hey i guess that

2158
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:57,360
you can't hear me yes it's a little

2159
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,320
quiet um so just speak up other than

2160
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,920
that

2161
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:01,920
we're good okay

2162
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:04,800
and i slide

2163
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,679
next slide okay

2164
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,719
this draft is about the split flow

2165
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:17,920
measurements

2166
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:18,880
species four measurements employ a few

2167
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,280
marking bits

2168
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,800
inside either of each packet for loss

2169
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:25,040
and delay measurement

2170
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,320
is a protocol independent technique and

2171
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,360
especially valuable

2172
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,719
for encrypted either protocols example

2173
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:33,040
given quick

2174
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:35,119
the methods described in this draft are

2175
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:37,679
about precise rtt

2176
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:38,719
spin bit plus direct bit round three

2177
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,520
packet loss

2178
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:42,320
spin bit plus round three plus bit and

2179
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,639
the two

2180
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:46,400
option there are two options about one

2181
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:49,360
way packet loss

2182
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,159
square bit plus loss event bit and

2183
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:54,559
square bit

2184
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:54,559
plus reflection square bit next slide

2185
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:03,760
okay there are some

2186
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:04,480
implementations that are already made

2187
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:08,239
and

2188
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:11,519
demonstrated in the acaton for example

2189
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:14,239
during the quick measurement project

2190
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,960
and the implementation are actually our

2191
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:18,159
free

2192
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:21,440
telecom italia implementation

2193
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:23,759
is on android mobile phones the probe

2194
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,799
is inside the mobile phones so the idea

2195
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,440
is to put the pro

2196
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,880
not in the network but also in the

2197
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:31,040
devices

2198
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,679
and end user devices there is some

2199
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,840
implementation on core network probes

2200
01:44:33,679 --> 01:44:38,080
and the orange jakama implementation the

2201
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,119
first one

2202
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:44,080
already in field by two years

2203
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:45,440
the akamai production cdns and core

2204
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:49,840
network props

2205
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,839
that's right

2206
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:58,799
i recap shortly the round try trip

2207
01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:02,320
time spin bit that is used to mark

2208
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:04,960
the packet in a client server protocol

2209
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:08,719
to measure the round trip time

2210
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:12,239
so the idea is to create a square wave

2211
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:15,360
signal that bunches between

2212
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:17,839
client and server and the length of the

2213
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:22,480
signal is equal to rtt

2214
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,480
time round trip time next slide

2215
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:30,000
so an observer can measure the length of

2216
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,880
the

2217
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,360
square wave signal and this length is

2218
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,040
equal

2219
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:39,839
to rtt there are some

2220
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,560
little issues a little bit depends from

2221
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,520
the

2222
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:44,000
view the first one is about the packet

2223
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,440
loss

2224
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:50,560
because the packet loss of packets

2225
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:55,119
cause the wrong estimates of rtt

2226
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:58,960
another issue is the ordering that can

2227
01:45:55,119 --> 01:46:02,080
change the spin the period edges

2228
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,679
and to create new periods new short

2229
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:07,679
periods

2230
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:11,679
and so we can have wrong measurements

2231
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:14,560
the last one is the so-called

2232
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,920
application delay because if there are

2233
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:20,239
holes in the traffic

2234
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:23,360
the period can be reflected

2235
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:26,559
in time so we can add a

2236
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:29,280
delay to the rtt

2237
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,280
next slide

2238
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:37,919
the first new idea of this draft is to

2239
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:39,519
add a bit a marking bit a so-called

2240
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:44,080
delay bit

2241
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:47,199
that marks a specific packet inside

2242
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:50,000
the spin beat period so the spin beat

2243
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:52,638
period is composed by many packets one

2244
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,679
packets usually the first one

2245
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:59,199
is a double market so an observer

2246
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,159
put on the path can measure the distance

2247
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:04,080
between

2248
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:07,119
two uh delay sample

2249
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,199
two double market packets and so

2250
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:11,280
the measurement is more precise because

2251
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:14,080
there isn't ambiguity

2252
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:15,199
caused from packet loss because if the

2253
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:17,679
packet is not

2254
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:19,440
detected in size the spin bit period

2255
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:24,000
that the measurement

2256
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:27,280
is not done and the delay beat

2257
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,480
detects a specific packet so there isn't

2258
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,639
a possibility that

2259
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:32,638
you can measure different packets on the

2260
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:37,840
edges of the periods

2261
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:40,560
next slide

2262
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:42,080
uh we another idea is about the packet

2263
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,280
loss the check on the

2264
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:49,600
important measurement that we can

2265
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,599
do using these marking bits

2266
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,400
we use one bit to mark some packets

2267
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,519
inside the float

2268
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,400
this packet bunches between client and

2269
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:01,679
server

2270
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:04,960
tweet uh twice two times

2271
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:08,880
so there are two periods to

2272
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:10,639
train all packets that bounces two times

2273
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,400
and they observer can measure the

2274
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,080
difference between the number of back

2275
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:15,920
end of the first train

2276
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:17,600
and the number of packets of the second

2277
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:19,760
train

2278
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,360
so in this case possible to have a

2279
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:26,080
statistical measurement

2280
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:29,679
of losses only seeing these two-bit

2281
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:32,080
market packets this works

2282
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:33,679
only in conjunction jointly with the

2283
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:37,440
spin beat because the spin bit

2284
01:48:33,679 --> 01:48:41,920
gives the period time

2285
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:47,678
inside the t-bit are considered

2286
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:50,320
okay next slide

2287
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,880
okay this is about the one it's

2288
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,119
different

2289
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,239
before the previous one because this is

2290
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:57,839
one

2291
01:48:54,239 --> 01:49:00,559
direction one way packet loss the

2292
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,280
traditional packet loss because because

2293
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,440
the

2294
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:05,040
round three packet loss is a new kind of

2295
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:07,839
measurement

2296
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,719
in which we can detect where the packet

2297
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,400
loss

2298
01:49:08,719 --> 01:49:14,800
occurred but in this case

2299
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:15,679
measuring the one-way packet loss we can

2300
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,320
measure

2301
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:20,480
the direction where the packet loss

2302
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:23,040
occurs

2303
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:25,598
the first bit used for this kind of

2304
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:29,040
measurement is the square beat

2305
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:33,199
that is firstly described

2306
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:35,679
in a draft of a couple of years ago the

2307
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:37,919
draft ferrum chewy weakness beats

2308
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:39,520
and is based on the alternate marking

2309
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:43,280
classical techniques

2310
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:47,360
already defined in rfc 8321

2311
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:51,040
the idea is to mark blocks of packets

2312
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:54,159
64 packets for example

2313
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:57,199
so if the blocks are

2314
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:57,759
of different length shorter length there

2315
01:49:57,199 --> 01:50:00,799
is

2316
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:01,599
a packet loss in this case the

2317
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,560
measurements

2318
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:06,320
happens between the end point and the

2319
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,800
measurement point

2320
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:11,599
in is this quite different because the

2321
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:14,560
previous techniques about

2322
01:50:11,599 --> 01:50:16,080
country plus or round trip time in this

2323
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,199
case the measurement is not

2324
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:20,960
a end-to-end measurement but is between

2325
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:23,199
the client and the server in one

2326
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,000
direction or the servant or serving the

2327
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:27,919
other direction

2328
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,159
so we can measure the loss between the

2329
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:32,719
endpoint and the observer

2330
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:32,719
next slide

2331
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:41,040
if we have two uh measurement point we

2332
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:44,639
can

2333
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:46,960
do some inter domain packet loss because

2334
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,840
we can do the difference between the

2335
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:50,960
packet

2336
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:52,639
arrived in a server that

2337
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,480
and the packet arriving the second

2338
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:56,480
observer so we can measure the

2339
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,959
difference the packet loss in between

2340
01:50:56,480 --> 01:51:00,559
the two

2341
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,960
server this is very useful to locate

2342
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:04,560
the losses inside the network inside the

2343
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:09,760
domain a network of a

2344
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:09,760
on telecom operator next slide

2345
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:14,960
okay this kind of measurement there

2346
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:18,239
could be

2347
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,520
measurement that is between the endpoint

2348
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,320
and those servers can be

2349
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,840
complemented by an end to end

2350
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:26,880
measurement

2351
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:30,080
that in this case made by the l bit

2352
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:34,239
the loss event bit the 7

2353
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:38,000
bit idea is to mark a packet

2354
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:41,360
with that is uh albeit

2355
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,800
put to one when a loss is detected by

2356
01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:45,679
the protocol

2357
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:47,840
so the idea is to have a connection

2358
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:49,679
between the protocol measurement inside

2359
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:53,520
application

2360
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:57,040
and the network measurement marking the

2361
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:59,440
a bit in a packet every

2362
01:51:57,040 --> 01:52:00,480
packet loss event detect inside the

2363
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,598
protocol

2364
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:07,119
so is only a one is a

2365
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,679
end-to-end measurement you know server

2366
01:52:07,119 --> 01:52:10,880
measure

2367
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:13,280
in every point is is put it always

2368
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,040
observe the end-to-end measurement on

2369
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:19,599
this

2370
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:22,800
direction on this path

2371
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:24,880
so complement the next slide complement

2372
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,520
is this kind of uh

2373
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:28,159
measurement with the previous one the

2374
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,360
cubit

2375
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:33,119
we can have we can split them the packet

2376
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:35,598
loss between the server

2377
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:37,199
and the server and between the client

2378
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:39,760
and the server so

2379
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,480
we have all the possibility to split the

2380
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:45,840
measurement

2381
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:45,839
to locate the losses next slide

2382
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:53,599
the alternative to l beat is to use the

2383
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,719
cubit

2384
01:52:53,599 --> 01:53:02,080
coupled with the airbeat their beat

2385
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:05,440
is a measurement that simply

2386
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:08,960
reflects the losses from one side

2387
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:11,839
to the other side so they could be the

2388
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,360
mark the packets the 64 packets for

2389
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:17,840
example

2390
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:20,880
if you find less than 64 packet market

2391
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,320
from the other side of the network to

2392
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:25,599
the other end point

2393
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:29,119
this endpoint reflects a period

2394
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:30,320
that starts with this number 63 for

2395
01:53:29,119 --> 01:53:33,360
example 62

2396
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:36,799
if there are this one or two losses

2397
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:39,119
in one side so we can measure

2398
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:41,119
on the other side the losses on the

2399
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:44,799
first uh

2400
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:46,080
way and part of the lawsuit the second

2401
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:50,000
way

2402
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:50,000
so we have in the next slide

2403
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:54,239
next dice please the possibility to

2404
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:58,159
complement

2405
01:53:54,239 --> 01:54:02,159
it is to measurement to have to split

2406
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:04,480
uh the losses between the two direction

2407
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,360
on one direction for example we can

2408
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:06,638
subtract

2409
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,239
the qubit measurement the loss

2410
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,679
velocities direction to the

2411
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:13,280
three-quarter

2412
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:15,760
measurement seeing the reflection bit

2413
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:16,480
so we can measure in one direction the

2414
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:19,199
end-to-end

2415
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:20,879
losses in the opposite direction this

2416
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:24,879
using only one direction

2417
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:28,480
server this next slide if we add

2418
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:32,080
two of two direction server

2419
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:35,598
we can split the measurement in two

2420
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:39,199
parts around three pluses right

2421
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:42,400
around three plus is left or

2422
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:43,519
the the single losses between the server

2423
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,320
and the client

2424
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,960
and between the client the server and

2425
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:51,840
the server

2426
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,840
okay next slide

2427
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:57,520
okay this is a very complicated slide

2428
01:54:54,719 --> 01:55:00,800
highlight only for documentation we can

2429
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:04,159
study directly on the on the draft

2430
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:07,520
that compare all the

2431
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:10,638
possibility to measure the losses

2432
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:13,199
using one and two beat the pros and cons

2433
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,199
next slide

2434
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,920
using three bit we have three

2435
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:22,080
possibilities

2436
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,040
to measure the precise rtt using two

2437
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:26,559
beat and

2438
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:30,239
round three packet loss using one bit or

2439
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:33,520
using only one bit for a spin beat

2440
01:55:30,239 --> 01:55:34,400
for delay at two beats for the packet

2441
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:37,040
loss

2442
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:38,799
one way using the two alternative

2443
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:43,440
possibility could beat and that'll beat

2444
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,440
ocubit and their beat okay

2445
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:51,199
next slide so

2446
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:53,520
these metrics are deeply discussed

2447
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:55,360
on the working group inside the mailing

2448
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:59,760
list we

2449
01:55:55,360 --> 01:56:02,080
demos this technique inside the

2450
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,679
and we joined the two previous drafts

2451
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:06,960
that are about

2452
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:08,159
the packet loss and we joined in one

2453
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:11,119
draft that is

2454
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:12,000
this one comparing lost bit and the

2455
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:14,480
reflection bit

2456
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,360
there are the two alternative using

2457
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:18,559
jointly with

2458
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:20,480
the equipment we request the working

2459
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:23,199
group adoption

2460
01:56:20,480 --> 01:56:25,598
and the welcome for question comments

2461
01:56:23,199 --> 01:56:25,598
okay

2462
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:33,598
if there are some questions

2463
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:35,839
i i in the next slide i put only

2464
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:35,840
some

2465
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:42,559
some reminder to the other draft that we

2466
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,360
presented

2467
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:47,040
the device measurement draft that the

2468
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:50,080
idea is only to put

2469
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:54,800
this measurement on the device user

2470
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:57,840
it is present some advantages

2471
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:57,840
you can ride on the

2472
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,920
on the system all right yeah i think

2473
01:57:02,639 --> 01:57:05,360
thank you and

2474
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:08,239
i don't think we have time to go over

2475
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:13,360
those slides now but those are available

2476
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:13,360
um does anyone have comments on this

2477
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:17,440
thank you for merging these two drafts

2478
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:20,560
by the way and i i think this is

2479
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:22,879
pretty interesting work overall so um

2480
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:25,840
i would definitely appreciate more

2481
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:25,840
feedback on the list

2482
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:36,000
all right looks like we have a empty

2483
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:38,560
queue

2484
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,440
so yeah yeah again thank you for doing

2485
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,119
this thank you for

2486
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:43,199
doing the work to emerge the documents

2487
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:47,040
and proposals

2488
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:47,678
and um i think this is one that we would

2489
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:50,719
like to

2490
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:50,719
consider for adoption

2491
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:57,519
great um and so um

2492
01:57:54,159 --> 01:58:01,839
for people watching the clock we are uh

2493
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:03,599
pretty much at the end of our time and

2494
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,440
um we've gone through all of the

2495
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:08,239
documents that we wanted to

2496
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:09,519
kind of have full slots available to

2497
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:10,638
unfortunately it looks like we don't

2498
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,360
have time for

2499
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:15,599
any of our lightning talks but i would

2500
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:19,040
like to remind people that those

2501
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:19,440
slides are available and to please take

2502
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,760
a look

2503
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:23,360
at those slides and um if you have any

2504
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:26,880
questions

2505
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:27,440
about those documents um shoot them to

2506
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,000
the list

2507
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:32,839
and what we'd like to hear is kind of

2508
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,840
more good feedback on those

2509
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:37,520
um kind of before we

2510
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,000
progress or have larger slots for those

2511
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:40,000
documents

2512
01:58:41,119 --> 01:58:49,839
any other questions from anyone else any

2513
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:49,840
any other things we should cover

2514
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:57,840
okay thank you everyone

2515
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:06,880
and um thank you to andrew for doing

2516
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,520
the notes looks like those are nicely

2517
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,000
filled out

2518
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:12,400
and we very much appreciate that and

2519
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,400
your help

2520
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:19,119
i agree have a good morning evening good

2521
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:30,000
night

2522
01:59:19,119 --> 01:59:32,080
thanks have a good idea everyone

2523
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,080
you
