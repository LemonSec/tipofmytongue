[Music]

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,518
that we are a research group and

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,280
[Music]

44
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,360
so we are not developing standard in the

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
result group so it's more long-term

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,000
research and collaboration

47
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,720
even if of course we can publish some

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
some draft as a informational

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,439
am conference

174
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,199
so it's not decided yet it will be free

175
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,399
virtual this conference or every

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,120
so we don't know yet hopefully maybe we

177
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
can

178
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,240
partially move there when we we will try

179
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
to have it online and to be collocated

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,959
with

181
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
i am too although the idea of being

182
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,479
collected the iem is also to

183
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
other people participating to this

184
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,440
question

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,680
during the concurrence so yeah so so we

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
will continue relying on

187
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,839
online meeting or we try to be monthly

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,399
on buy monthly meeting

189
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,880
depending a bit on the situation of

190
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
course

191
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
we continue to to exchange my email to

192
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
our dedicated meeting as we have for

193
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
example for

194
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,320
the document on the ai last

195
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,519
last week and also yes as you may know

196
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,200
we have a different

197
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,519
collaborative tool that we can use the

198
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
github the google documents

199
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,600
so yeah do not hesitate to share any uh

200
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
questions ids

201
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,560
or you would like that

202
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,560
the group continue to work on the

203
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,518
different items it's really important to

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,518
have your feedback as well

205
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,440
um okay sorry just as i mentioned before

206
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,560
a brief

207
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,040
a brief overview of the the

208
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,760
discussion regarding use cases there was

209
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,959
a presentation the last interim meeting

210
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,519
and so jefferson is leading a

211
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,880
business uh this action item and this we

212
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,320
proposed

213
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,880
a template on the github platform

214
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
we have a list of proposed scales now

215
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,160
that are

216
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,160
just summarized here and

217
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
there are some of course pending

218
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
questions that we have not yet

219
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
answered basically one is what will be

220
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,160
the outcome of the use case

221
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
uh for what it will be used we are

222
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,680
thinking of course it can be used to

223
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,640
help in elaborating working another

224
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,199
the end of the group like the

225
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,360
architecture what are what would be the

226
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,839
learning of the different use case

227
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,440
uh one question is also should we keep

228
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
the documentative use case are separate

229
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
i try to have a single document so

230
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,079
currently it may be that

231
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,640
you have the feeling that people would

232
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,800
prefer to have separate at that time now

233
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
because uh maybe in the uh in the

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,560
beginning

235
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,000
and but anyway yes our discussion just

236
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,920
we should have template and

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,040
we should have gained a common level of

238
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
description

239
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,399
so this says the discussion today is is

240
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,959
cancelled but

241
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,079
jefferson will and ourselves will

242
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,479
continue to

243
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,160
to pursue this action over the mailing

244
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,399
list and the next engineering

245
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,800
meeting so

246
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,720
here it was just a brief introduction so

247
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,680

253
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,279
is uh

254
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,279
is your turn with the uh presentation of

255
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,800
uh studies of concept and definition

256
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,320
draft

257
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,880
okay you want me to share or you

258
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,560
continue sharing as you prefer let me

259
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,680
know

260
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,239
let me try to share it okay to stop

261
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,239
probably

262
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,160
can you see my screen

263
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,079
you cannot see your screen now

265
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
yes it's okay

266
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,519
no i think now it was starting to

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,560
to say that something will be sure but

268
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:21,839
then it stops

269
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:21,839
okay let me try again very quickly

270
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
oh nice

271
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,519
i don't know can you see the slide yes

272
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,519
perfect

273
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,160
yeah we can see okay so i i tried to be

274
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
quick because this is uh

275
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,319
just an update so status on intent-based

276
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
networking

277
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,880
concept and definitions draft this is a

278
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,000
research group document

279
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
um and uh i'm presenting on behalf of

280
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,920
the co-authors

281
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:16,560
alex lissandranja so recent history

282
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
uh just to situate a bit the purpose of

283
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,479
this draft so

284
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
the goal is to contribute towards a

285
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
common and shared understanding of

286
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,920
idea in terms concept and functionality

287
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,199
which is why it's called concept and

288
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
definitions

289
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,439
uh this this work has been around for uh

290
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,000
several years now

291
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,600
um so we had version 2 of the research

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
group document posted

293
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,959
mid-september the main updates in this

294
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
revision was to address a review

295
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,680
provided by ali razaki

296
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
earlier and so we provided changes

297
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,760
according to

298
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,399
the review we also provided a more

299
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,639
detailed

300
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,480
uh description of ibm functionality

301
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,560
which is on section six with new

302
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
subsections dedicated to intent

303
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
fulfillment and internet

304
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,519
assurance uh some redefinition of

305
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,240
uh i mean clarification of the

306
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,120
distinction

307
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,040
from policy-based management uh added a

308
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,160
couple of examples of intents

309
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,199
this was requested several times by

310
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,760
some comments and we also have a

311
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
towards the end of the document um kind

312
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,439
of

313
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,160
hanging items on discussions or future

314
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
work

315
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,959
and so it's renamed for the moment into

316
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,639
additional consideration

317
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,359
and we made a various editorial

318
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,240
improvements uh throughout the document

319
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,240
so this was i mean available for a

320
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
couple of months now and

321
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,320
we already made the status in the last

322
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,360
interim meeting

323
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,720
um since then uh there have been a

324
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,040
research group last call

325
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
which uh jerome handled it was started

326
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
beginning october

327
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,399
and last for the whole month of october

328
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,040
jerome which is also the the shepherd

329
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
from this

330
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
for this document

331
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,160
mentioning his conclusions mid-november

332
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,360
a couple of weeks from now and

333
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,240
so forth for what will be the next step

334
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759
just a very high level uh outcome of

335
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,639
this research class called for this

336
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,240
document

337
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,480
um we we got very large uh support

338
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,720
positive expression of support uh i

339
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,759
contained a bit more than 18

340
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,880
different sources in the research group

341
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,959
what sequence that expressed that the

342
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,519
document is ready to move on

343
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,319
and we also received in parallel to that

344
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,880
um

345
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,040
some i will say more detailed reviews

346
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,959
beyond just the support

347
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,639
and so we thank all the researcher

348
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,680
participants for this

349
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,440
support and especially for the reviews

350
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,839
so this is the status so far and

351
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,800
this is the last slide next step what we

352
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,120
will do

353
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,199
so first um we are working on the new

354
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,440
version which would be zero three

355
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,639
um this should be ready in the next

356
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
couple of weeks

357
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,160
uh we are a bit busy with the atf so far

358
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,959
but after that

359
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,439
we will go full speed on this and the

360
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,120
main

361
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,120
focus of this revision will be of course

362
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,239
to address the comments and the reviews

363
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,280
received during the last call um there

364
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,120
are different levels

365
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,678
of comments and reviews so we have still

366
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,239
to figure out um

367
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,520
the impact of those comments and reviews

368
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,160
and the changes we will need to

369
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,039
to implement but this is uh our work

370
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,000
first step

371
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,919
and then once this version is ready uh

372
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,120
in fact it's a bit in the end of the

373
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,960
effort to evaluate depending of

374
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,039
two situations mainly if it's only a

375
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,480
kind of minor revision with

376
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,480
editorial changes and clarifications um

377
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,679
it may not be necessary to go through a

378
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
second full

379
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,160
research group last call because the

380
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,559
support is already there

381
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,880
on the other hand if to address the

382
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,000
reviews we need to

383
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,240
change a bit more text refactor some of

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,080
the aspect restructure the draft

385
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,559
this may be a more major revision and

386
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
then uh depend we will discuss with the

387
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
shepherd

388
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,399
if it may require to go through a

389
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
secondary social class call

390
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,160
just to make sure that uh this these

391
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,320
important changes

392
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
uh are validated by the research group

393
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
again

394
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
but again this is second step and once

395
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,960
this is decided

396
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,439
and that we have validated that

397
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,520
we hope to be able to submit to iosg

398
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,559
review

399
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,440
and that's it

400
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:43,840
any questions or things you'd like to

401
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:43,840
know on this

402
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,919
yo

403
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:01,600
hello yeah yeah sorry

404
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:05,120
sorry is there any question

405
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,199
or feedback so

406
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,959
as uh you said laura you you've got a

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,320
lot of let's say positive feedback

408
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,559
mailing list i just can confirm that

409
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
so now it's uh it's up to you to see how

410
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,720
you will address a different comment and

411
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,200
then as

412
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,559
you say yes depending on the type of

413
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,240
modification

414
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,720
you will do then we will uh i will check

415
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,120
if

416
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,080
this is necessary to go for let's say

417
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,360
kind of formal

418
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,320
and last call yeah

419
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,280
i mean i'll say there are some reviews

420
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,320
that uh

421
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,080
need more attention to to really see

422
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,399
what changes we need to make to the

423
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,439
document so that's why we

424
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
couldn't reply uh until now but this is

425
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,960
really

426
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
on our table uh yeah i think it's good

427
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,440
that

428
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,479
you receive a review from let's say new

429
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,480
readers

430
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
so basically you have also an external

431
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
point of view and

432
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,120
somebody that was not aware of the work

433
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,639
until now

434
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,399
it's important because these documents

435
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,440
somehow

436
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,720
give some let's say basis or

437
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,400
a fundament for this uh for the ibn

438
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,919
work in the group so it's important that

439
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,960
although the uh

440
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,000
understanding from uh external reader is

441
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,840
uh is uh well

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
well certain well

443
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,960
yeah sure okay so if there is

444
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,360
no other feedback we can move to the

445
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,360
second presentation on ibm

446
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,879
so this is about the internet

447
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,280
classification i think it's

448
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,280
chain links that will present right

449
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,280
so jenny maybe you can

450
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,158
just enter into the cure or unmute

i will introduce our draft of intended

487
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,159
classification

488
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:53,360
okay next slide please

489
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,720
the brief introduction of our

490
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,918
draft about the draft proposals as

491
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,880
intent classification methodology to

492
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,559
be used to identify the scope and

493
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,559
priorities of

494
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:12,639
individual projects pocs

495
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:16,399
research initial initial

496
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,440
types or open source projects the output

497
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,960
of the intent classification

498
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:26,559
is the intent tsunami

499
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,679
and describes intent solutions

500
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,600
intent user types and in some

501
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,480
tabs and intense scopes network scopes

502
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,678
and

503
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,600
abstractions and the life cycle the

504
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,840
three

505
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,279
classifications have been proposed in

506
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,959
our draft following the classification

507
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,400
workflow

508
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,520
include carrier solution and

509
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,279
data center solution and enterprise

510
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,960
solution

511
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:02,240
now ietf 108

512
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,760
there is a poc about a multiple

513
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,880
a multi-layer approach for ibm

514
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,200
solution has been successfully used as

515
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,039
an

516
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,960
example for our proposed classification

517
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,559
methodology

518
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,559
okay next night please

519
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,360
the history of our draft is about

520
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,400
on july the 1st intent classification

521
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,559
draft

522
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:38,320
adopted by the rg and

523
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:41,600
on november the 2nd we uploaded

524
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,799
the version 1 to ietf

525
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:49,039
and there are 33 comments

526
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:53,120
addressed since the rg adoption core

527
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,480
and addressing comments

528
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,239
of our draft we have do something

529
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,679
to we'll submit the version 2

530
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,880
about working process

531
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:10,799
and three comments addressed and merged

532
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:14,159
into git and two comments outstanding

533
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,158
okay next please

534
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,120
distract the structure of our trust

535
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,880
is the in in

536
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:32,479
introduction and keywords across

537
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,840
and abstract intent requirement

538
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,039
and functional correct raters and

539
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,158
behavior and in section 6

540
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,600
is about intent classification

541
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:49,200
and some other sections yes

542
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,199
okay next slide please

543
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,960
from the last meeting we do some updates

544
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,159
about

545
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,840
our draft on version one

546
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,720
we provided detailed description of the

547
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,240
intent classification methodology

548
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,640
workflow and how it can be extended

549
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,240
we expanded it in section 6.1

550
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,080
and as we provided intent classification

551
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,440
examples based on the

552
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,720
ietf 108 poc

553
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,080
a multi-layer approach for ibm

554
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,880
for the carrier use case and the dc use

555
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
case

556
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:36,640
we add new ad sections uh

557
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,720
at the section 6.3.3 and

558
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:44,640
6.4 and 0.3 and then we up

559
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:48,080
updated intent descriptions with

560
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,440
additional information on how intense

561
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,639
manifest from an

562
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:58,480
operational point of view in

563
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,840
sections 6.3

564
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,840
0.1 and 6.4.16

565
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,960
we also sharpen our jobs position in

566
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,480
relation to intent based networking

567
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,559
concepts and overviews draft

568
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:22,320
the section involvement of intent in the

569
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,279
application of ai to network management

570
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,480
has been

571
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,760
removed and we think it would be

572
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,120
used in future draft proposals that

573
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,960
focus on how to do it then

574
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:44,879
various readabilities improvement

575
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:48,399
we have done okay next slide please

576
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,520
we have do something after the we submit

577
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,360
the

578
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,399
version 1 and we will

579
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,918
submit version 2

580
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,199
after the meeting i think about we

581
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,080
continue this discussion on pocs

582
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,360
integration into draft with barbara and

583
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,879
the water

584
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,600
and we clarify clarification

585
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,320
on requirements for different intent

586
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,158
tabs

587
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:22,480
based on context in our draft in

588
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:25,600
section 4.2 and addressing the benefits

589
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,640
of intents to network requirements

590
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:32,080
in section 4.3

591
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,679
and there is outstanding about we will

592
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,439
add a scope section within introduction

593
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,880
for in identify identifying the scope

594
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,399
and the priorities

595
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,760
of projects and then

596
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:55,840
will include a definition

597
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,840

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,200
a multi-level approach to ibm

612
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,480
poc demonstration uh first

613
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,640
attempt to adopt the intent

614
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,120
classification

615
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,120
classification okay next night

616
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,080
next step we believe

617
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,200
the draft is a reasonably stable

618
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,279
and we will address the new

619
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,039
remaining outstanding items in version 2

620
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:33,840
and then solicit draft reveals

621
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:33,840
okay that's all thank you any questions

622
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,840
wants to he's raising him

623
00:31:52,640 --> 00:32:00,159
okay so you think the

624
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,919
the content is reasonably stable

625
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:06,480
you indicate also that you had some good

626
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,159
i will say interaction with walter

627
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,200
barbara and molka on

628
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,120
making kind of example with their with

629
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,120
their demo

630
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,239
so you think your document will be ready

631
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,279
to proceed after

632
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
you you issue the version two uh towards

633
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,799
research group last call or do you

634
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,080
expect um

635
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,679
i mean are there other parts of the

636
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,360
content or

637
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,200
which food bean scope of the draft that

638
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,199
you think should be should be provided

639
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,679
i'm not sure if my question was clear do

640
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,760
you expect to have

641
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:11,840
new topics new aspects to be developed

642
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:11,840
in the draft

643
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,840
want to say something

644
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,879

tmf and etsi he discussed me for the

648
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,760
internet classification too so maybe we

649
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,879
can see

650
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,480
more from

651
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,480

about

654
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,960
the uh the intent classification

655
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,719
yeah maybe maybe we're going to discuss

656
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,879
after meeting

657
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:21,839

okay thank you

659
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:35,839
yeah please go ahead

660
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,839
olga you wanted to make a comment

661
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,560
well guy if you wanted to make a comment

662
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:03,839
i think you should put yourself back in

663
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,839
the queue

664
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,079
you can speak olga

665
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,839
all right with yourself otherwise

666
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,000
yeah okay we cannot hear you and i don't

667
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,320
know jerome if you can uh unmute her but

668
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,280
at least on my side i cannot

669
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,280
no i cannot

670
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,960
i think no i think you

671
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,640
okay so just because i think we are

672
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,799
drifting a bit

673
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,118
uh and we have a full agenda um

674
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,480
i suggest we we continue with the next

675
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,720
draft and uh

676
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,079
eventually if olga managed to raise our

677
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,078
comments we can hear that

678
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:20,000
uh still in the ibn slot occasion

679
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,320
okay yeah sure so next uh

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,320
next time on the android is the uh

681
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,160
transpose licensing presentation

682
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,160
by uh by lewis

683
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,040

so do you want actual slide are you if

685
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,720
you show the slice would be better for

686
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,720
me

687
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
okay

688
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,280
okay thank you so essentially well i i

689
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,240
will present the

690
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
the update of the examples of the drug

691
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,640
to be honest

692
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,920
there is a very very few updates

693
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,400
and mostly related to terminology

694
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,079
essentially the what we have done here

695
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
is to align with the terminology that is

696
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,400
being used

697
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,680
in this working group where we have

698
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,359
transitioned from the concept of

699
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,279
transporter slice to the

700
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,598
concept of itf network slice so

701
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,040
i i will go briefly to the to the point

702
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,040
but essentially this is the

703
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,040
the main message so next slide please

704
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,640
okay so again we have a line with the

705
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,640
terminology being using

706
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,279
in this now the concept is related as

707
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,078
itf network slides in order to have

708
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,040
clear that

709
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,040
we are working on top of the

710
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,079
technologies that are being developed in

711
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,680
atf exclusively even though there is yet

712
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,640
some discussion in the mailing list

713
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,240
about if we need

714
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
to consider or at least to reflect the

715
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,720
fact that negotiation could be

716
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,799
could go beyond that including some

717
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,839
other things like compute and and so but

718
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,079
i think that

719
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,040
at the end of the discussions we will

720
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,000
stay yet in

721
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,800
with the idea of referring only to the

722
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,440
the

723
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,200
the connectivity and then to the idf

724
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,920
technologies essentially

725
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,799
so we have updated as well the basic

726
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,680
reference

727
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,720
accordingly so there has been a an

728
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,759
update

729
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,520
of the documents in this working group

730
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,920
also adopting this terminology so we

731
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,960
have done the same so basically updating

732
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,240
to the latest

733
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,960
version of those documents so um

734
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
here maybe is is important to say or

735
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,800
relevant for us at this

736
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,680
uh the the propo the proponents of this

737
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,400
work

738
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,359
that um so how we we do see this as a

739
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,800
complement to the

740
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,680
working in this in the sense that

741
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,720
with this approach this intent-based

742
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,359
approach would be complementing

743
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,680
what could be related to the concept of

744
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,078
itf network slice controller

745
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,480
so basically yeah adding this other

746
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,040
piece on top of that controller

747
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,160
dealing with the intents for the

748
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,320
creation and

749
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,598
approvation of the slice but also

750
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,040
whatever

751
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:31,040
has to do with the slice in the itf

752
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,040
scope next slide please

753
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,920
just as a refreshment of what is the the

754
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,920
purpose of the draft

755
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,520
so is to leverage on the ibm

756
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,520
technologies for requesting

757
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,079
itf network slices for essentially um

758
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,160
assisting the customer and this customer

759
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,680
could be a high level system maybe the

760
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,040
the system from the 3dbp could be a

761
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:58,078
clear example so to request

762
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,599
and and manage let's say the the the

763
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,720
negative slice

764
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,960
so um so we do

765
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,919
uh foresee the the role of this intent

766
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,440
based system

767
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,960
as a one managing the um descriptive

768
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,760
request from the customer

769
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,040
and essentially interacting later on

770
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,319
with the idea of network slice

771
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,960
controller in order to

772
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,560
have the slides uh ready in the network

773
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,839
the benefits of following this

774
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,359
intern-based approach is is

775
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,119
clear for us but with the portability of

776
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,839
the solutions across implementation and

777
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,720
networks

778
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,279
so having a disintend-based mechanisms

779
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,560
we could

780
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,560
guarantee that portability in an

781
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,000
uneasiest way um

782
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,279
having a simple way of expressing

783
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,400
transporters one itf never slice needs

784
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,920
uh and this buddha is the political

785
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,119
customer for instant vertical industries

786
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,800
and so to re

787
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,640
to be not so specialized in the

788
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,520
particular technology but

789
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,560
essentially working with these

790
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,160
descriptive manners of

791
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,160
requesting the slice um and necessary

792
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,078
they focus on the what that would be the

793
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,598
idea of never slice and not the

794
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,040
how so the essential of the idea intent

795
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,160
basis system

796
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,160
so next slide please

797
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,598
so as next steps we will our intention

798
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,520
is to keep

799
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,160
working on developing the internet-based

800
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,720
capabilities for itf network slices

801
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,680
so further of the content that we

802
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,759
already have in the

803
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,520
in the draft also very important to

804
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
align with the ongoing propositions for

805
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
internet use cases as discussed in in

806
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,440
the interim

807
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,759
the last interim meeting so essentially

808
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
we

809
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,040
finally define a kind of template for

810
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,280
use cases or

811
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,359
also adapt the description of this use

812
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,800
case to that kind of template

813
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,839
or once uh i mean or

814
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,359
even work uh more deeply in the matching

815
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,160
with the internet-based architecture

816
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,960
and so on so far so essentially uh

817
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,960
trying to align and synchronize with

818
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,160
the other activities here in such a way

819
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,920
that could be seen

820
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,598
let's say as as not as an independent

821
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,960
proposition let's say but as something

822
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,280
integrated in the

823
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,599
overall scope of interbase within the

824
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,319
network management research group

825
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,119
and this is for the draft itself so for

826
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,040
the

827
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,960
for the community for the group just to

828
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,440
request comments and inputs for

829
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,560
uh growing new versions of this draft

830
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,280
for updating

831
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,799
for new versions for sure and we are

832
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,240
considering maybe for the next meeting

833
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,760
to ask for adoption

834
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,160
as a an intern use case um so we remind

835
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,520
that

836
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,118
there is a number of word guardians

837
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,440
defined and one of them is the

838
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,240
the definition or the selection of use

839
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,599
cases so

840
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,879
we think that this could be a potential

841
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,280
good use case also be

842
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,480
because we could show the link with this

843
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,920
working group and

844
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
this could be a strength let's say the

845
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:59,839
the proposition and this is all from my

846
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,839
side thank you

847
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,560
thank you thank you uh luis so

848
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,319
yes i think you're long you want to say

849
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,759
something right

850
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,400
uh yes uh can you hear me yeah

851
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
yeah okay thanks reese and uh orders for

852
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,599
for for the work and the updates

853
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,720
uh i have a comment

854
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,440
which is more a bit of a surprise and

855
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,839
a question the first comment is i saw

856
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,599
that

857
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,279
there is this terminology update an

858
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,960
alignment with teas about

859
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,359
calling that itf network slice

860
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,480
when i read that i thought um are you

861
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,720
trying to put

862
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,640
intent for the you see the itf network

863
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
we used to have in the physical iitf

864
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,839
meetings because for me ietf network

865
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,720
is the iatf network so i was a bit

866
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,799
confused when i

867
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,480
saw that first so i don't know if the

868
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,960
terminology will evolve i know it's

869
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,240
it's done in tears design team etc but i

870
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,160
found it a bit confusing

871
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,919
and i'm not even sure that externally to

872
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,078
iitr it will be uh

873
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,000
well understood what what an ietf type

874
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,560
of network is

875
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah i mean everyone else around iitf

876
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,799
calls that transport network

877
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,240
i know it could be too limiting but yeah

878
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,119
it's terminology uh

879
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,319
discussion but this is just a a bit of a

880
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,240
surprise for me

881
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:22,560
and but my question is more um on the um

882
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,160
i think i i i concur to what you are

883
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,799
proposing to continue developing the

884
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,520
draft and

885
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,960
eventually becoming a surgical document

886
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,440
on the use case i think it's a good

887
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,560
good way forward i'm just wondering in

888
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,839
terms of scope

889
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,400
because i remember that for instance

890
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,599
amina was

891
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,240
also having some proposal around slice

892
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,400
lifecycle automation and other things

893
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,598
if because i think your scope is quite

894
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,200
well

895
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,720
aligned with again iatf technologies and

896
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,598
especially what what's being developed

897
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,520
in teas

898
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,720
so i see the value in that i'm just

899
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,079
wondering if

900
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:02,640
um you will be open to consider

901
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,520
a broader scope than just ietf network

902
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,680
slice

903
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,079
so that it can encompasses also other

904
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,359
types of i mean that the internet based

905
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,599
interface or the internet based

906
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,799
characteristics could also be

907
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,520
reused by other sdos or for other types

908
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,160
of slides

909
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,920
just to consider if this will be part of

910
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,920
what you you would agree or

911
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,000
you will prefer to stick to to this uh

912
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,040
specific scope

913
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,240
okay thanks lauren uh sorry the first

914
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,480
comment the other day i

915
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,720
i also i didn't like either the

916
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,319
the terminology it was more comfortable

917
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,200
with the transport slides but well this

918
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:39,680
was the

919
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,200
the consensus reach until now at least

920
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,078
so we need to live with that and

921
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,359
probably we

922
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:47,040
maybe we can find a better name

923
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:48,799
for the for this draft in order to put

924
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,520
that confusion so i agree with you that

925
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,359
probably is confusing outside the itf

926
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,079
even inside idea but

927
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,078
um by the way i didn't change the the

928
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,800
name of the draft itself i mean the

929
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:02,160
the code the draft sla if and

930
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,960
transporter slides and so

931
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,839
but just simply the title so they are in

932
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,520
the second point

933
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:12,880
uh i i see pros and cons um

934
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,160
or maybe more than cons what i would

935
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,599
like to

936
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,319
to to to to get be

937
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,240
let's say close to the working piece so

938
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,160
opening the scope i think is

939
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,240
interesting and probably necessary in

940
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
order to to be sure that it's consistent

941
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,479
with whatever effort that could be done

942
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,520
outside and maybe we can think of 3gpp

943
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,720
or in in

944
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,119
some other bodies so from that point of

945
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,160
view

946
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,079
i think would be beneficial but

947
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,160
i think that also could be somehow

948
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,800
interesting or beneficial to to keep the

949
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,319
link with the

950
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,200
working test that in that sense

951
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,920
somehow i don't know if reducing the

952
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,279
scope of

953
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,119
narrowed on the scope or at least

954
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,599
zooming on what could be the

955
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,480
interaction with the itf network slice

956
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,680
controller

957
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,200
uh below because so how this helped us

958
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,078
to to build a

959
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,799
a complete story so linking with uh what

960
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,960
we are doing

961
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,400
in this as well what we do is we expect

962
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,200
to do in this

963
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,079
so yeah i mean we can discuss i'm open

964
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,879
to

965
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,880
to go in that direction but um maybe

966
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,000
keeping the link with uh

967
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,400
the with the ground being done in in

968
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,240
this

969
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,760
because i think would be beneficial for

970
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,078
for us to having the complete

971
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,079
story

972
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,599
thank you make sense

973
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,480
okay uh i think that danian you have a

974
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,920
little uh

975
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,920
a comment or a question

976
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:53,839
for me yeah yeah

977
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,839
did you raise your hand during the queue

978
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,400
hello you can speak yes we can hear you

979
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,839
okay okay can you can you help me to

980
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,839
share the

981
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:07,839
screen

982
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,480
okay it's for the next presentation i i

983
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:15,279
told you

984
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,000
you were you wanted to to raise a

985
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,000
comment

986
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,839
so just just maybe before we go to the

987
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,359
next next presentation

988
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,279
is there any other comment question

989
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,920
regarding the uh

990
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,920
the presentation of the ietf network's

991
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,839
[Music]

992
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
license

993
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,040
so maybe maybe for my uh from my side uh

994
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:46,160
surgery for speaking

995
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,319
uh luis can you make sure to well

996
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
understand on your next point your last

997
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,640
point on the next step slide so the idea

998
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,118
is that

999
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:55,279
for to when you say ask for admission of

1000
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,800
the graph as an energy intense case

1001
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,920
uh it's you say that in a next meeting

1002
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,280
so it mean

1003
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,440
it means that

1004
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,200
you want you want maybe next virtual

1005
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,520
meeting you you expect to have something

1006
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,598
more

1007
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,440
let's say concrete regarding oh we will

1008
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,319
push you in use cases i suppose in order

1009
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,400
to see your

1010
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,839
feet okay so that's what for instance

1011
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,760
what we have discussed in some other

1012
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:21,359
meetings this idea of the platform use

1013
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,200
cases or even uh

1014
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,279
uh better matching with the intern based

1015
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,279
architecture this is something that

1016
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,960
is not yet in the draft so probably if

1017
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,200
we evolve the work in this

1018
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,640
for coming months maybe we can somehow

1019
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,359
align better the

1020
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:36,799
this proposition with the the overall

1021
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,240
intent working

1022
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:41,359
here and and with that maybe have a more

1023
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,439
solid draft to

1024
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:47,759
be adopted

1025
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,760
okay

1026
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,240
okay thanks for clarification

1027
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,920
so there is no other question so let's

1028
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,839
move to the next presentation

1029
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:13,839
that is about network measurement intent

1030
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:13,839
so we share the slides

1031
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,839
so

1032
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,920
okay

1033
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,359
i think you can see your slide and so

1034
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:42,799
you can start

1035
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,319
okay thank you and then what we are

1036
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,599
talking about

1037
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:50,000
is the network environment intent and

1038
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,520
the original chart can be found in the

1039
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,839
official website

1040
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,839
and next plant piece

1041
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,079
and in keeping with our common

1042
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,558
understanding

1043
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,280
we will use the intent-based networking

1044
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,839
framework

1045
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,800
in the chat of ibm concepts and

1046
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:10,319
definitions

1047
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,640
to illustrate our network management

1048
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:14,880
since the functional models described in

1049
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,960
our current manuscript are not

1050
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,079
one-to-one corresponding with the

1051
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,200
functions

1052
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,400
in the existing framework

1053
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,279
we have divided the architecture into

1054
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,920
three parts

1055
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,359
in order to expand the overall thinking

1056
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,040
more clearly

1057
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,480
and as you can see we set recognize or

1058
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,079
generate intent

1059
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:41,119
and the chance that refined as a part

1060
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,839
learn or plan or linger configure or

1061
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:45,440
provision

1062
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:49,119
monitor or observe qualitative and

1063
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:52,800
endless or adjacent as a part and

1064
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,839
abstract and the report as a part and

1065
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:58,079
in terms of shaft intent classification

1066
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:58,880
network very much intent can be

1067
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,559
classified

1068
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,040
as network intent or operational

1069
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,359
task intent or some other kinds of

1070
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,759
interns

1071
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,759
okay next please next slide please

1072
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,040
and next the network environment intent

1073
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,000
refers refers to based on user

1074
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,880
or network operators demand for network

1075
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
states

1076
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,440
and automatically collect network state

1077
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,520
information on the mind and the in order

1078
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,000
to illustrate it more clearly

1079
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,839
we will present the detailed process of

1080
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,040
each within each divided

1081
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:39,759
part and we will take the environment in

1082
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,800
terms of

1083
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,559
busy network performances as an

1084
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:49,040
example in the recognize or generate

1085
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,319
intent function and the translator or

1086
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,119
refine function

1087
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:55,040
network environment intense needs to be

1088
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,200
translated into actions

1089
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,200
and requires taken against the network

1090
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,078
it means that in the environment in

1091
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,359
terms of busy network performances

1092
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:10,400
due to network dynamic changes such as

1093
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:13,598
daily network buying wise occupancy

1094
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,720
reach the period of network busy time is

1095
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,119
not fixed

1096
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,598
so these functions need to determine the

1097
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,480
network busy time of the day based on

1098
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,520
historic

1099
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,480
data learned by ai and then determining

1100
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:28,000
the content

1101
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,200
need to be measured and then we will

1102
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,599
take the lapping part as a whole namely

1103
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,040
the

1104
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,880
part consists of learn or plan or ringer

1105
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,920
function configure our

1106
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,720
provision function monitor or observe

1107
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,280
function

1108
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:44,319
validate function and endless aggregate

1109
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,520
function

1110
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,640
and in this part based on the required

1111
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,280
measurement content and the equipment

1112
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,160
support

1113
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,040
degree it determines the corresponding

1114
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,440
environment

1115
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,079
scheme and verifies whether the

1116
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,200
environment

1117
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,520
scheme is visible and the next slide

1118
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,520
please

1119
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,400
and at the same time the

1120
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,880
light pink part also needs to determine

1121
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,880
whether the network is busy according to

1122
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,520
the current network

1123
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,559
stage while the busy time threshold is

1124
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,440
exceeded

1125
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,319
this part performs automatic network

1126
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,599
deployment

1127
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:31,759
such as in cli mode and

1128
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,599
to meet the requirements of the network

1129
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,680
environment of intent

1130
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,599
these parts also need to collect

1131
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,240
measurement data on the mind

1132
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,680
and of course this data is collected

1133
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,879
automatically

1134
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,598
as and the abstract function and report

1135
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,799
function

1136
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,000
from the last part the outcome

1137
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:52,640
needs to be reported back to the user to

1138
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,559
verify

1139
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,640
whether the threshold meets the

1140
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,359
requirement and verify

1141
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,799
whether the network management intent is

1142
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,520
satisfied

1143
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:04,640
if either of the two conditions is not

1144
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,960
satisfied

1145
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,680
the network measurement intent will be

1146
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,440
modified

1147
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,000
and readjust the scheme at the same time

1148
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,440
it also needs to determine whether the

1149
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,480
start time for scheme

1150
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,880
execution is the start time when the

1151
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,160
time

1152
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,960
that with the network is busy and next

1153
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,960
slide case

1154
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,960
uh in this page i will explain the

1155
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,040
advantages of convening network

1156
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,160
environment with intent

1157
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,279
first of all is automation

1158
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,000
is it can realize automatic network

1159
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,799
measurement

1160
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,240
and automatic analysis of measurement

1161
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:49,280
results

1162
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:52,399
second is in intelligence it can realize

1163
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:56,240
the intelligent anomaly detection

1164
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,319
normally prediction and automatic repair

1165
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,439
when the environment results is not

1166
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,240
in conformity with the expectation and

1167
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,119
the finally

1168
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,919
is the closed loop control due to the

1169
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,680
closed loop

1170
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,520
operation is available in the

1171
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,319
intent-based network

1172
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,040
so we want to realize the continuous of

1173
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,359
the

1174
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,240
optimization of network measurement

1175
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,440
results

1176
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:23,200
based on network environment intent

1177
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,200
and the next slide please

1178
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,559
so for the next steps we will refer to

1179
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,760
the ibn frame of

1180
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:38,240
reference and then update the manuscript

1181
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,319
and refine the steps for the

1182
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,359
implementation of the corresponding

1183
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:44,480
functions

1184
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:47,759
and work with ibm use case team and

1185
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,559
then incorporate this use case into the

1186
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,240
upcoming ibm use case draft

1187
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:56,839
and we are looking forward

1188
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,160
to the comments suggestions and

1189
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,160
questions thanks

1190
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,520
okay that's all yeah thank you gentle

1191
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,640
representation

1192
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,200
laura please go ahead yeah yeah

1193
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,400
thank you for for the work and and the

1194
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,240
the proposal

1195
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,079
um i think there are interesting aspects

1196
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,479
uh if you understand correctly what you

1197
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,760
want to do but i was also a bit confused

1198
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,119
with some of uh the way you you you

1199
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:34,400
present things

1200
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,960
um what i understood is that um

1201
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:40,640
as an operator or as a customer it may

1202
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,119
be interesting in getting some um

1203
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,960
reporting information or what you call

1204
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,359
measurement information

1205
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,720
um corresponding to some to some

1206
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,000
expectations

1207
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:56,160
uh and then what that this

1208
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:00,240
this needs of of of getting some

1209
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:02,720
specific information will trigger

1210
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,879
different measurements or monitoring

1211
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,319
activities inside the network

1212
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,280
and the other things you are i think

1213
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,720
trying also to to put together is

1214
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:17,040
um that you may want to to detect

1215
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:19,839
if the the measurement or the monitoring

1216
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,680
uh can fulfill the the expectation of

1217
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:23,759
the measurement

1218
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,118
provided by the operator and the other

1219
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,319
thing is that

1220
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,880
if some um some issues

1221
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,400
are in fact happening and and to be able

1222
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,200
to detect in fact

1223
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,480
from this measurement expectations if

1224
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,960
there are deviations

1225
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,839
from from what you expect to see so for

1226
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,040
me

1227
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:46,640
what i was a bit confused is that

1228
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:48,880
you have at least two or three

1229
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,558
phases or aspects that you're looking

1230
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,880
after in the draft

1231
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,079
but uh the way they are articulated

1232
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,079
right now

1233
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,280
it was a bit confusing for me so i see

1234
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,000
potential

1235
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,839
but i think we may work maybe together

1236
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,640
to to try to clarify

1237
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,200
uh the different steps or where is the

1238
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,200
intent

1239
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,040
and where are the other functionalities

1240
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,279
uh coming into play

1241
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,279
so this was just kind of observation

1242
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,119
that i think there are potential but

1243
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:18,640
uh maybe need some clarification in

1244
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,599
what you really want to achieve and how

1245
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,598
you see this to work

1246
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,359
okay we will clarify father and thank

1247
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,079
you for your

1248
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,078
suggestions

1249
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,520
you go okay

1250
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,720
yes i i agree with you around in his

1251
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,440
comments that this

1252
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:55,200
is somehow mixes uh the idea of

1253
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,200
measurement with the idea of action

1254
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:59,040
building a closed loop or whatever the

1255
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,200
nature and this is a little bit

1256
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,400
misleading that's true

1257
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,240
this is something that i think is really

1258
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,480
vulnerable here and it's connected with

1259
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,479
some

1260
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:14,160
um some ideas that we are

1261
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,960
starting to work with it's precisely the

1262
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:20,078
idea when you have uh

1263
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,359
when you have a catalog or a

1264
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,880
or a database or whatever you call it of

1265
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,880
for example measurement tools and

1266
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,280
measurement capabilities

1267
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,720
and what you express is precisely this

1268
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,319
is that you request

1269
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,959
the measurement capability and not

1270
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:37,200
necessarily the tool because the tool

1271
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,960
may have to be adapted to the particular

1272
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,399
environment in which you are going to

1273
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,599
deploy it

1274
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,280
and uh well what uh

1275
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,799
personally i'm trying to connect this

1276
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,880
with an idea that i'm

1277
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,559
insisting very much recently which is

1278
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,079
about the repeatability how you

1279
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,880
guarantee that

1280
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,079
whatever you do and whatever you report

1281
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,480
to others

1282
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,559
whether it is in on a paper or a test

1283
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,720
recall or an experiment

1284
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:05,280
report or whatever is something that can

1285
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,759
be repeatable by others

1286
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,040
these an approach like this probably

1287
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,400
would

1288
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:14,480
translate in uh in a higher level

1289
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,520
of expressing the repeatability

1290
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,960
requirements

1291
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,720
and i think this is uh if uh if we

1292
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,839
narrow down a little bit the scope this

1293
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:25,839
will be quite interesting

1294
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,839
okay okay thank you for your suggestions

1295
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:36,240
and

1296
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:39,839
we will um discuss it on relay

1297
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,839
thank you

1298
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,119
okay thank you again chen uh we have to

1299
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,559
move to the to the next

1300
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,440
time on the agenda um so we will start

1301
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,000
with the

1302
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,160
part related to artificial intelligence

1303
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,720
lauren you are the the first one

1304
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,720
in this part

1305
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:07,650
okay i'll try to share my screen give me

1306
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,770
a second

1307
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,960
[Applause]

1308
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,960
[Music]

1309
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:35,839
i think someone needs to release

1310
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:35,839
oh yes i'm sorry

1311
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,680
okay yeah we can see it

1312
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,839
and now you can see the presentation

1313
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:50,720
fullscreen

1314
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,720
yes okay good

1315
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,160
let me just take my notes

1316
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,960
okay so um so this is in the area of

1317
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,720
uh artificial intelligence from the

1318
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,720
network management so we're a bit

1319
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,000
switching topics and

1320
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,160
today i'd like to give a

1321
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,240
presentation on artificial intelligence

1322
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,839
for network and service automation

1323
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,078
and especially to look into the standard

1324
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:18,960
enablers and

1325
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,359
in some research directions the slide

1326
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,160
set

1327
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:24,319
that you will see today is a bit more

1328
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,359
focused on the standard enablers

1329
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:30,480
i will give only a short overview of the

1330
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:32,400
research topics because it's uh quite

1331
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,280
big and i think it will deserve a

1332
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,359
an order full presentation and uh just

1333
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:40,319
to to stress also that this is part of a

1334
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:42,558
larger activity inside nokia

1335
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,640
and this is only a an extract of this

1336
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:45,920
work that we propose in the scope of

1337
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,000
energy

1338
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,760
and if you are interested to learn more

1339
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,359
on this activity or if you want to

1340
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,000
collaborate with us

1341
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:55,839
because we have also related actions and

1342
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,160
activity in order sdos

1343
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,480
don't hesitate to contact me after the

1344
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,399
meeting or offline

1345
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,640
uh we also hope that the content

1346
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,720
presented here will help to

1347
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,759
provide input to the ai research

1348
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,240
challenges document

1349
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,359
that we that journal will present just

1350
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,078
after this

1351
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:15,520
and also i have a lot of slides sorry

1352
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,000
for that but

1353
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,799
we wanted to present um the overall

1354
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,480
content

1355
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:23,119
so i will go a bit quick on the first

1356
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,480
slide which talks about the background

1357
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,079
but you can look at them after and

1358
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,359
in order to keep some time for for the

1359
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:31,359
core part of the presentation

1360
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,799
so some main drivers in this area offer

1361
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,440
artificial intelligence for network and

1362
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:43,759
service automation

1363
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,640
in fact we see continuous innovation and

1364
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,200
progress

1365
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,359
especially in the technology of ai

1366
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:52,558
theories and breakthroughs in a

1367
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:54,240
new algorithm etc and also a continuous

1368
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,880
improvement in the performances of all

1369
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,759
these

1370
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,440
these different techniques in the area

1371
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,000
of data

1372
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,200
more and more data being collected also

1373
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,240
from different

1374
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,919
types of sources data also becomes

1375
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:13,038
available and we say

1376
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:15,520
everywhere in different uh area of

1377
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,559
the operator infrastructure these data

1378
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,599
are also becoming more and more

1379
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,720
aggregated

1380
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,000
it's not only a single types of counters

1381
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:25,279
that you can collect but it comes

1382
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,920
from uh technological devices but also

1383
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,799
from

1384
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,319
customer records etc so really different

1385
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,400
types of data being

1386
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:34,160
put together to to um to be used as

1387
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,200
sources for the machine learning

1388
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:38,160
algorithm

1389
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:41,118
and also more data awareness in the

1390
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,440
different organizations about

1391
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,240
the value of the data and how to

1392
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,760
organize

1393
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,759
operations and activities in the

1394
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,559
different organization uh to be

1395
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,920
data-driven

1396
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,079
and have this data around us everywhere

1397
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:56,160
on the compute side uh this is pretty

1398
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,880
obvious i mean we are still

1399
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:01,038
quite pushed by uh continuous uh

1400
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,039
improvements in performances of

1401
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,799
the compute architecture but also the

1402
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,920
fact that there are

1403
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,920
many different uh computing architecture

1404
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,319
in fact in support to uh

1405
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,119
especially machine learnings and a

1406
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,038
continuous

1407
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,280
improvement of the performance of all

1408
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,480
the different architectures

1409
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,359
for the tooling this is very important

1410
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,520
in the area of

1411
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:25,279
ai and machine learning a maturing

1412
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,680
ecosystem of different platforms

1413
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:31,440
languages and libraries that are

1414
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:34,000
most of the time publicly available in

1415
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,720
their open source uh very helpful to

1416
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,039
support

1417
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,640
uh the research and the progress and

1418
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:42,319
innovation in that area

1419
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:43,920
and also very important this aspect of

1420
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,079
pipeline automation so not only

1421
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,000
providing the tools and libraries but

1422
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,200
also to ease a bit the work of the

1423
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,480
developers and the

1424
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,598
integrators in uh creating data

1425
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,079
and the different automation that occur

1426
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:01,599
in the in the ml development process

1427
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:03,680
um finally on the business side um

1428
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,520
this is a bit more disruptive uh

1429
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,720
especially different uh i will say

1430
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,079
models how to deploy and operate uh

1431
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,839
machine learning machine learning as a

1432
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,039
service air as a service

1433
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:17,359
uh through apis and we see also

1434
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,480
more and more in the telco space

1435
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,520
collaboration

1436
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,119
especially direct collaboration between

1437
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:27,200
web scale actors and operators

1438
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,039
and sometimes without deco vendors in

1439
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,919
the loop so this is a

1440
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,960
quite a change in how networks are being

1441
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,359
operated and

1442
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,359
who is involved in this new era

1443
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,119
so there are drivers but we also

1444
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:44,960
identify

1445
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,520
different gaps especially that

1446
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,160
when we say artificial intelligence in

1447
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,920
fact

1448
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,160
most of the time we refer only to

1449
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,839
machine learning and in machine learning

1450
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:58,078
especially to deep learning

1451
01:07:53,839 --> 01:08:02,400
which was really the mainstream and what

1452
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,720
is driving the activity in that area

1453
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,000
but there are many other techniques that

1454
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,598
also should be considered

1455
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,680
in the scope of ai and especially if you

1456
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,000
want to to be able to cope with the

1457
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,240
different

1458
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,680
problems that we face in network and

1459
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,198
service automation

1460
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,439
the second main gap is that um so far

1461
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,719
the ie-based solutions have been

1462
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,759
demonstrated

1463
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,600
in isolation or especially towards

1464
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,158
specific use cases so this is good

1465
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,960
because it shows that it works

1466
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,000
but we also a bit lacking um all aspects

1467
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,679
about uh

1468
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,799
i mean collaboration or coordination

1469
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,799
between different ai-based solutions

1470
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:40,080
it's a very limited aspect of

1471
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,238
generalization

1472
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,559
and automation um across different

1473
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,599
technology across different use cases

1474
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:50,480
and also um we're a bit lacking this uh

1475
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,239
reusability factors due to the lack of

1476
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,919
architectural principles

1477
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:59,040
especially in the operator environments

1478
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,120
i mean sometimes what work for a use

1479
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:04,158
case is difficultly replicable in

1480
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:07,040
in other areas and also

1481
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,439
the third gap uh related to this um to

1482
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,359
this

1483
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:11,120
discussion today is the limited use or

1484
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,359
reliance on standards

1485
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,120
uh i think you're very well aware that a

1486
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,400
lot of the activities

1487
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,399
um in ai i mean across different

1488
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,879
industries

1489
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:24,080
happens in so-called open research open

1490
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:27,679
source open data

1491
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,759
schemas uh but we see also values in um

1492
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,960
in having standards being developed

1493
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,600
especially for the

1494
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,279
telecommunication environments so still

1495
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,799
in the infancy age of this

1496
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:40,560
ai standards for networks but also that

1497
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,399
the standard needs to position itself to

1498
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,159
be able to provide value

1499
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,920
with multi-vendor and open solution in

1500
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:49,920
that area

1501
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:53,120
and also the fact that without standards

1502
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:55,360
uh we will miss some key uh properties

1503
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,640
like interoperability and reusability of

1504
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,400
the uh

1505
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,760
what what is currently delivered via

1506
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,839
this kind of de facto

1507
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,840
uh software environment

1508
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,080
then to highlight a bit what we consider

1509
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:11,120
to be

1510
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:13,120
the scope for considering

1511
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:15,360
artificial intelligence and network and

1512
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:18,080
service management and automation

1513
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,599
in fact if you bring the two together

1514
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,760
for us we

1515
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,840
have broadly two two main domains or

1516
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,840
cases of applications which are

1517
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,040
what we call ai assisted management and

1518
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:30,239
automation

1519
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,159
which is where you um you take

1520
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:33,519
current operations current

1521
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:36,639
functionalities

1522
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,679
and you try to um inject ai into that or

1523
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,000
make them ai

1524
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,280
based and so you increase the efficiency

1525
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,159
and the support to human driven

1526
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,080
operation

1527
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,599
but you see this is what you do today

1528
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,480
and you do it with ai

1529
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,640
the other main scope with the ai what

1530
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:54,320
you call air enable or air and power

1531
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:57,679
which is really to try to discover

1532
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:58,639
unveil new areas new way of doing things

1533
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:00,960
that

1534
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,640
were not possible without without ai

1535
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,080
either due to the complexity

1536
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,199
or due to uh uh it was too challenging

1537
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,519
to process uh

1538
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,440
the amount of data etc so it's really to

1539
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,880
not do what you can do today is to do

1540
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,799
more things new things and in fact

1541
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:19,440
as a conclusion the we need really to

1542
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,320
have an advanced integration

1543
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,000
and embedding of the capabilities uh

1544
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,080
which is needed to maximize the use and

1545
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,400
efficiency of ai assisted and air enable

1546
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:30,400
management automation so we really

1547
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,759
think it's important not only to work on

1548
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,000
the ai techniques

1549
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,280
but also on how they get integrated and

1550
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,480
how we embed them

1551
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,480
with the network environment

1552
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,320
in terms of a bit coverage this high

1553
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:45,678
potential areas

1554
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,599
um i will not explain each of these and

1555
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,880
in fact it's not exhaustive it's just to

1556
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,520
highlight that

1557
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,880
in fact you can apply uh ai techniques

1558
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,880
virtually everywhere in in the

1559
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,120
networking environment and

1560
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:57,920
you can have different um types of

1561
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,440
problems

1562
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,040
different benefits different types of

1563
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:04,000
techniques you can apply

1564
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,679
um and and so the goal and kind of an

1565
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,280
underlying challenge that we

1566
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:10,480
start to see here also is it's to find

1567
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,280
solutions

1568
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:15,040
uh or capabilities that are really

1569
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,519
reusable and replicable

1570
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:19,040
so that you can apply it end-to-end so

1571
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,280
for all the management tasks and all the

1572
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:24,159
operations that operators

1573
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,000
are doing and not only always specialize

1574
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:29,199
in use case based techniques

1575
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,679
so um

1576
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,759
a kind of counterpart with that it's

1577
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,880
kind of a problem technique mapping and

1578
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,159
it's absolutely not prescriptive it's in

1579
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,239
fact to consider

1580
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:44,080
a typical panel of techniques

1581
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:47,040
that you could use to address some of

1582
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,719
the problems and ai tasks

1583
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,280
but we don't see any limit here i mean

1584
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:54,239
it's just a kind of indicative mapping

1585
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,679
because maybe tomorrow someone will use

1586
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,440
a technique use

1587
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,199
never used before for for this kind of

1588
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:59,839
problems and may trick it in a certain

1589
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,919
way

1590
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,520
and it will work and have very great

1591
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,199
results so this we don't know

1592
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:06,719
but it's just that for some of the ai

1593
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,280
type what you see a bit on the left is

1594
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:10,719
that

1595
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,120
depending on the type of um

1596
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:15,199
i will say task that you're after if you

1597
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:18,239
want to

1598
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:19,678
get some explanation a diagnosis

1599
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:21,360
this is essentially when you are you

1600
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,480
need to have partner or even detection

1601
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,199
and recognition

1602
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,799
you can address anomaly detections data

1603
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,080
protection breach etc

1604
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,840
and then you have certain set of

1605
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,440
algorithms that fits well to this kind

1606
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,719
of problems

1607
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,639
and then if you are for instance for

1608
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:35,920
prediction and search uh

1609
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,840
then you can use different types of

1610
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,600
techniques and if you go in fact to the

1611
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,920
last kind of level which is

1612
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,199
prescriptive and decision making then

1613
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,880
you can see also that the type of

1614
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,559
algorithm are a bit different and you go

1615
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,000
more towards structured learning

1616
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,239
reinforcement learning multi-agent

1617
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,199
system where you really connect with a

1618
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:53,280
bit more

1619
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,678
activating on on the network and not

1620
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,239
just learning patterns or identifying

1621
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:58,239
clusters

1622
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,719
then uh we have also tried to categorize

1623
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,080
some set of

1624
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:08,719
key challenges uh for ai

1625
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,519
and network management or ai networks

1626
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,000
together

1627
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,640
so first i mean just you to be able to

1628
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,239
specialize

1629
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,360
in our own field so first it's that

1630
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,400
networks

1631
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,599
are hard ai problems um networks are

1632
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,599
distributed

1633
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,600
dynamic environments usually

1634
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,480
heterogeneous in terms of technology

1635
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,760
and and types of operations and choices

1636
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,400
from operators

1637
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,040
and also we also face more and more the

1638
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,440
kind of challenge related to encryption

1639
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,280
we have also complexity in the data sets

1640
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,599
that we face in network environment

1641
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,960
uh it can be laws it can be performance

1642
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,920
counters it can be

1643
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,199
uh customer records etc so very types of

1644
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,760
data sets

1645
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:51,120
uh and also very technology specific or

1646
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,320
domain specific

1647
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,679
and complex and the really and the

1648
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,280
relative complexity also in the

1649
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,840
algorithm to deal with this

1650
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,120
complexity in the data sets and also we

1651
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,360
have

1652
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,800
high dimensional spaces in the network

1653
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,639
data

1654
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,719
and they are also interogenes and

1655
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,840
diverse i mean if you go to the access

1656
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,000
network if it's fixed access or mobile

1657
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,040
access

1658
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,159
3g 4g 5g it's different types of

1659
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,239
of data types and also diverse because

1660
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:21,360
you have different formats for different

1661
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:24,480
applications different vendors etc and

1662
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:25,120
the last point which is starts to have a

1663
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,360
bit less

1664
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,400
of a challenge recently but access to

1665
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,920
network data

1666
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,599
can also be sometimes difficult and

1667
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:32,159
challenging and you have a lack of

1668
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,920
reference

1669
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:36,080
label data sets in many different

1670
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,920
applications

1671
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,519
a second challenge is on the confidence

1672
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,440
in ai so

1673
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,360
ai technology introduced new challenges

1674
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,799
and specificities such as

1675
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,960
you can have performance the gravitation

1676
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,400
over time if your the profile of your

1677
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,320
data changes

1678
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,920
you need to retrain at least minimum

1679
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:54,000
retrain on your model sometimes you may

1680
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:57,199
even need to change it

1681
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,159
data sensitivity database adversarial

1682
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,839
inputs

1683
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,679
some issues related to governance to

1684
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,640
address properly security and privacy on

1685
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,960
the data

1686
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,280
used by the machine learning algorithm

1687
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,199
shift also from a kind of deterministic

1688
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:11,440
and probable algorithm that we have in

1689
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:13,759
many applications in network environment

1690
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,440
to uh the typical machine learning

1691
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,760
paradigm which is based on stochastic

1692
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,000
and statistical paradigm

1693
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:22,400
and also challenges related to

1694
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,800
explainability accountability of

1695
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,839
how the decision process was made by

1696
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,080
those algorithms that

1697
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,840
we don't necessarily understand the

1698
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,679
inner workings so

1699
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,120
on top of that we also see the need for

1700
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,320
a comprehensive framework to increase

1701
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,559
confidence in the use of

1702
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,559
ai

1703
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,719
human eye interactions are the third

1704
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,719
challenge

1705
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,560
need to support i mean we can have

1706
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:46,159
different levels of intelligence

1707
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,480
provided by the ai and then different

1708
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:50,480
level of support to the human operator

1709
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,919
from acc to empower it as you remember

1710
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,678
we explained in the scope

1711
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,360
so how to assist or extend the human

1712
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,440
operator in the service design the

1713
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:00,480
parametrization and operation

1714
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:02,400
different you don't assist the same way

1715
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,480
on the different phases and depending on

1716
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,199
what the human operator is capable of

1717
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,718
doing

1718
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,559
and also have adaptive intelligence

1719
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:10,080
automation based on dynamic levels of

1720
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:13,520
automation and supervision

1721
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:15,840
you'll be able to trade and to delegate

1722
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,440
different levels of autonomy to your ai

1723
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,960
operations

1724
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,799
also different roles and interactions

1725
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,400
between the ib system and human

1726
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,679
operators with what you see in the in

1727
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,759
the video diagram

1728
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,840
that depending of what the role of the

1729
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,520
ai versus the operator the human

1730
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,840
operator is

1731
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,640
it's more or less like a combination of

1732
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,880
our

1733
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,600
augmenting the human assisting the human

1734
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,360
or replacing it

1735
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,920
finally our fourth challenge we call ai

1736
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:45,440
diversity is that

1737
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,199
i mean the eye techniques are not

1738
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,799
i mean it's a broad set of different

1739
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,159
techniques with quite different

1740
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,520
characteristics and then

1741
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:53,199
they will have different requirements

1742
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,679
and standardization needs

1743
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:57,040
um also the overall design integrating

1744
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,080
and averaging individual

1745
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,600
ai properties needs to be put forward

1746
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,760
coordination between distributed air

1747
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,679
applications to enter current into an

1748
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,120
operation how we can cope with this

1749
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,199
diversity and make sure that we can

1750
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,679
coordinate in a useful way

1751
01:18:09,199 --> 01:18:12,559
and also the fact that the software

1752
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,280
environment

1753
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:16,320
supporting this ai specific systems are

1754
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,080
also diverse

1755
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,080
and sometimes even proprietary

1756
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:24,559
then what we see as very important to to

1757
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,679
understand this journey is what we call

1758
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,800
a joint evolution

1759
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,880
of ai and ops so we don't consider only

1760
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,159
ai in isolation and network management

1761
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,400
management or network operation

1762
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:36,559
isolation we really think that

1763
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,759
it's a joint evolution so we want to go

1764
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,280
from

1765
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,880
what we see on the left side which is

1766
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,920
with the situation today what we call

1767
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:47,760
raw ai and automated ops to

1768
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:50,640
the kind of ultimate stage in uh 25

1769
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,520
and beyond intuitive ai and autonomous

1770
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,080
ops and

1771
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,040
to go through that in fact we can

1772
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,719
consider

1773
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,800
various criterias what you see on the

1774
01:18:56,719 --> 01:19:00,320
left ai and data

1775
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,320
scale and adoption practice and

1776
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,799
integration competence and security

1777
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,000
standards regulation etc so what we want

1778
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,600
to insist in this

1779
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,760
slide and again i will not go into the

1780
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:12,960
details due to lack of time but

1781
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:14,960
it's that it's not only driven by ai

1782
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,440
techniques or ai technology development

1783
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:19,199
this is just the first row what the ai

1784
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,320
can do and what the type of data you

1785
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,839
need to have

1786
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,759
and also we see there are still

1787
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,239
evolution valuable evolution variable

1788
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,480
unlock

1789
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,839
to do there but it's not only that you

1790
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,480
there are other things which are more on

1791
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,679
the

1792
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:34,159
um the penetration of of ai uh

1793
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,719
in the um in the infrastructure also the

1794
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:38,960
no ho

1795
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:41,520
the practice of using and developing ai

1796
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,880
specifically for networks but also what

1797
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,000
i said about this confidence and

1798
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,920
security

1799
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,360
uh making sure that we can safeguard the

1800
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,239
ai operation and

1801
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,400
adopt it at wide scale etc and the very

1802
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:55,360
importance of standards and regulation

1803
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,719
standards for interoperability and

1804
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,920
regulation in order to make sure we

1805
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,080
comply with

1806
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:03,600
the right frameworks and and policies in

1807
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:07,360
terms of addressing privacy security

1808
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,360
and other related ethical issues

1809
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,719
then to frame a bit the

1810
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:19,440
the the approach here is

1811
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,199
it's uh to show a bit where we see uh i

1812
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:22,239
mean it's not that you will have ai only

1813
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,960
in one of um

1814
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:26,879
a small area in the network uh it will

1815
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,320
really be pervasive everywhere as you

1816
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,400
can see at the bottom we can have it in

1817
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,400
the different segments different domains

1818
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,440
uh also capturing the specificities of

1819
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,040
ai being deployed

1820
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,678
in such environment if you deploy on a

1821
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,639
smartphone or a sensor it's not the same

1822
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,880
type of ai

1823
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:43,280
and and we say computing environment

1824
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:46,320
that you can get if you deploy it

1825
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:49,679
in a big data center and also if you go

1826
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:51,360
up i mean vertically you have ai in the

1827
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:54,080
data plane but also you will have

1828
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,679
uh application of ai for the control

1829
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,400
plane and also the management plan which

1830
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,159
is

1831
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:00,080
the main area of concern for for network

1832
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:01,199
management and network operations

1833
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,559
and then in the different effort

1834
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,159
management domain you will have ai

1835
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:07,440
dedicated for instance if it's

1836
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:09,280
operating in the um in the run access

1837
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,799
or if it's operating in the core or it's

1838
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,400
up everything in the transport so

1839
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,400
you can also capture different

1840
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:15,839
specificities of the operations there

1841
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,839
and also the end-to-end service

1842
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,880
management and

1843
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,199
what you see also sorry

1844
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,960
this kind of arrows it's not limited to

1845
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:26,400
only management and operation but also

1846
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,560
the interactions

1847
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,759
with the control and the data plane and

1848
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,520
with the

1849
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:33,440
i would say the human operator and the

1850
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,840
network operating and service operating

1851
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,839
centers

1852
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,400
in terms of standardization scope i'll

1853
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,400
go very quickly on that so just to

1854
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,920
consider three main areas

1855
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,440
key enablers and functionality really um

1856
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,199
i will show some slides on that but this

1857
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,799
is really the core of what we think

1858
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:53,040
should be

1859
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,280
the enablers to to put forward in order

1860
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,280
to really make sure we can integrate and

1861
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:00,400
support fully

1862
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:02,320
functionality and operations based on ai

1863
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,559
the second aspect is support for

1864
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:07,040
deployment and diversity

1865
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,719
this aspect is very important because

1866
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,600
the first one is really to say what we

1867
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,840
need to develop

1868
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,120
to make it work to make it integrated

1869
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,040
the second one is

1870
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,480
if you develop enablers you want to make

1871
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,719
sure that you can reuse them

1872
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:20,320
and apply them to as many scenarios as

1873
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:22,239
possible as many technologies as

1874
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,639
possible as many use cases as possible

1875
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,320
so

1876
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,840
you don't want to develop an enabler

1877
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,799
that will be too specific

1878
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:31,040
ins for instance to a a given technology

1879
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,040
or given protocol or a given deployment

1880
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:35,280
you want to make sure that you can use

1881
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,440
it as broadly as possible and so

1882
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,759
we see also a role that when we design

1883
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,759
these enablers when we specify them

1884
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,800
and we say the research topics we need

1885
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,880
to investigate

1886
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,400
we need also to make sure that our

1887
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:50,880
design is extensible

1888
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,879
and um and portable

1889
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,239
the the final aspect trust and adoption

1890
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,159
this is really because

1891
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,919
um it's not just because you have good

1892
01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:59,839
technology and you can apply it in many

1893
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,880
areas that it will get adopted

1894
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,560
uh with this change going to more and

1895
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:06,960
more ai-based operations

1896
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,840
we need also to support the user the

1897
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,080
operator

1898
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,600
uh different uh verticals that will

1899
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,600
reuse this technology

1900
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,120
uh in having the right frameworks in

1901
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,360
place uh

1902
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,559
a trust building framework a security

1903
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,120
framework and all these different

1904
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,400
techniques

1905
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,000
you know they're really to support and

1906
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,960
make sure that when you use the ai

1907
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,080
technologies and

1908
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,000
they've been embedded in your

1909
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,600
infrastructure you can know how they

1910
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,600
operate you can audit them

1911
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,600
you can have explanation etc

1912
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,800
so the way we have structured uh we

1913
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,919
propose to structure

1914
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:41,760
the um some of the standardization

1915
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,239
aspects and research aspects for network

1916
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:46,639
and service automation using ai

1917
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:49,440
is with this so-called enabling areas we

1918
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:52,560
have identified six of them

1919
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:56,400
execution data interai actions

1920
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:59,600
governance and inner ai and

1921
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,239
for each of them in fact we try to

1922
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,120
describe

1923
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,599
what we consider to be important um and

1924
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,000
how

1925
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,880
this contributes to being an enabling

1926
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,280
area

1927
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:10,800
for ai-based operation so for instance

1928
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,639
of this execution or existing

1929
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:14,960
environment is really to consider

1930
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:15,840
a versatility of and this continuum of

1931
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,480
where the

1932
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,159
applications can be deployed uh we can

1933
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,718
think for instance of some of the the

1934
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,799
work

1935
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,840
uh being developed in the coin energy

1936
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,960
about this um

1937
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:29,920
data discovery data ability and

1938
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,639
um the contra part on the execution and

1939
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,159
compute

1940
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,600
where is the compute what is the form of

1941
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,559
compute and how you can deploy your

1942
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,719
applications

1943
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,840
uh on top of this distributed computing

1944
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,320
environment

1945
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,120
so really finding the good combination

1946
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,639
between

1947
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:47,440
deploying the air in terms of operations

1948
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:49,040
and also the access to data and we

1949
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,919
relate that to a set of different

1950
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,080
standard needs

1951
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,560
so having the ability for instance to

1952
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,000
express requirements and constraints

1953
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,000
for the different deployment options of

1954
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,080
the applications can i run

1955
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,159
more or less distributed what are my

1956
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:05,519
requirements in terms of

1957
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:07,040
computing processing powers storage etc

1958
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,560
and the counterpart is what my

1959
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:10,000
infrastructure is providing as

1960
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:10,480
capabilities and in fact we need to

1961
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,280
match

1962
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,080
those two sets of capabilities and

1963
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,679
constraints

1964
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,679
in order to make it to be able to

1965
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:19,520
support a wide variety of

1966
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:21,520
deployment scenarios and to automate in

1967
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:24,159
fact those scenarios

1968
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,159
for the data enablers it's a bit the

1969
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,400
same situation is

1970
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:29,519
in fact to ensure that we have access to

1971
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,599
the right data

1972
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,800
at the right place at the right time and

1973
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,600
there are many uh

1974
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,800
challenges related to that sometimes

1975
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:38,800
data is not available

1976
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,400
our data is meaningful only for a

1977
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,480
certain amount of time so we need also

1978
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,040
to be able to localize

1979
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:46,159
the ai execution with where the data is

1980
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,280
collected or where the data is

1981
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:48,400
meaningful

1982
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,400
there is also an issue in the

1983
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:51,199
representation of the data we have

1984
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,599
already

1985
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,759
good data collection platforms but we

1986
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,080
need also to work more on the

1987
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,440
description of what the data is the

1988
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,639
so-called metadata

1989
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:03,199
especially if we want to be able to

1990
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:03,679
automate if i don't want the human to

1991
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:05,839
say

1992
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:07,120
i understand that this is this

1993
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,520
performance counter

1994
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,559
and you need to plug it as input to this

1995
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,239
machine learning

1996
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,400
if you want a machine to do that we need

1997
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:16,799
to have descriptors of what the data is

1998
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,000
even going towards maybe some ontologies

1999
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,480
describing this so

2000
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,679
we see a role for the standards and some

2001
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,879
research aspects

2002
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,639
uh related to that also the fact that um

2003
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,920
the data patterns are dynamic and will

2004
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,199
change over time especially in our

2005
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,120
networking environment

2006
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:32,799
so limited validity of the learn model

2007
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,519
limited generalization of the inferent

2008
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:37,040
knowledge

2009
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,920
so this was considered uh an important

2010
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,280
area of

2011
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:44,880
research um

2012
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:45,920
enter ai excuse me excuse me i think uh

2013
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,840
maybe to

2014
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,840
to move forward maybe to some conclusion

2015
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,840
because

2016
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:59,679
a bit longer i will accelerate uh so we

2017
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,600
have uh still three other neighbors so

2018
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,000
italia is really to consider

2019
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,520
everything related to interactions

2020
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,120
interpolation where you have multiple

2021
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,679
ais being developed if you remember the

2022
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:11,360
diagram i've shown

2023
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:13,040
you we have a lot of different ai

2024
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,799
instances everywhere for different

2025
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,679
applications but you will have also to

2026
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,080
orchestrate

2027
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,600
how they operate together and there is a

2028
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,080
lot of standard needs and research

2029
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,320
aspects to investigate there

2030
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,360
actions very important one this is

2031
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,679
really

2032
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,199
for closing the loop of automation if

2033
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:31,120
you have an output of an ai

2034
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:33,120
or machine learning algorithm it can be

2035
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,000
a score it can be a vector it can be

2036
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,360
different forms

2037
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,360
but you cannot use it right away out of

2038
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,360
the ai so if you want to automate

2039
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,880
the usage of this output you need to

2040
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,799
plug it to the right actions to the

2041
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,320
right orchestration etc

2042
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,000
so this is very important also and

2043
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:49,679
related to data this aspect of

2044
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,280
describing what is the output

2045
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:55,679
and what is the action i can activate

2046
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:57,519
governance this is a very very important

2047
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,120
area as you can see a lot of different

2048
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,600
considerations and standard needs

2049
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,280
this is ready to consider usability

2050
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,120
trust and integration of

2051
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:08,159
the i component in a network and service

2052
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:10,559
automation operation

2053
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:13,199
in rai this is a bit different because

2054
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,040
this is really considering what's inside

2055
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,480
this is the different techniques

2056
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:20,000
self-supervised learning

2057
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:21,759
new forms of deep learnings or algorithm

2058
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,080
etc what would be the evolution of inner

2059
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,440
eye and the potential

2060
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,440
new stone that needs that may emerge

2061
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,759
from that

2062
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,519
we also have other additional important

2063
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:32,320
considerations at the architectural

2064
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,960
level

2065
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,799
going towards machine reasoning security

2066
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,360
which is a very important aspect

2067
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,120
that we consider transverse to to these

2068
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,960
different enablers we have considered

2069
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,880
an ethics and regulation which more and

2070
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,880
more becomes integral part of the

2071
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,480
technology development

2072
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:50,159
so this is a slide about the research

2073
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,599
topic overviews and you i think you can

2074
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:53,360
understand why i cannot go

2075
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,800
into much more detail but each of these

2076
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:56,719
books in fact represents

2077
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,480
a kind of research topic or research

2078
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:01,679
area related to ai

2079
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:03,440
in network and service automation and

2080
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:04,960
you can see also that there are a lot of

2081
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:06,719
connectivity between each of these

2082
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,480
research topics and the other topics so

2083
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,320
the color code is a map to

2084
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:11,678
the different enabling areas but you can

2085
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,799
see also that across the different

2086
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,320
enabling areas

2087
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:15,760
you have a lot of relationship and

2088
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:18,080
interdependence between the different

2089
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:19,840
topics

2090
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:21,840
and finally just to summarize because i

2091
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:24,320
think we're already quite overtime

2092
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:26,000
this is a bit to frame what we believe

2093
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,880
could be good directions to um

2094
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,320
to push forward go deep this is in fact

2095
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:32,560
to maximize automation by

2096
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,040
really enabling the integration of the

2097
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:38,719
full range of ai capabilities

2098
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,400
second to go wide again if you have

2099
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,239
excellent enablers excellent ai

2100
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:43,120
technologies but they are too

2101
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:44,638
specialized

2102
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,239
then you are missing something so go

2103
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:47,600
wide is in fact to be able to make sure

2104
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:49,440
that you can support the broadest

2105
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,960
application deployment diversity

2106
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:53,440
for the telco and also vertical

2107
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,560
scenarios so to ensure portability

2108
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,440
reusability

2109
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,800
go safe is in fact this aspect of if you

2110
01:29:57,440 --> 01:30:00,638
want to foster an adoption

2111
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,159
you need to make sure that you can

2112
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,239
provide support

2113
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:06,320
the human in understanding how the ai

2114
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,040
works how it is integrated what is what

2115
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,120
is doing

2116
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:11,120
and also very important governance and

2117
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:12,960
security frameworks to safeguard the air

2118
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,440
operation

2119
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:17,040
so that's it sorry for being long it's a

2120
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,799
very dense content and

2121
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:22,320
i will really welcome if you have for

2122
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,320
the comments or introductions of that

2123
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:38,400
any comment um

2124
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,000
laura you can hear me yeah yeah yeah can

2125
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,040
you hear me okay okay now because i got

2126
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,880
an error message

2127
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,239
and i was thinking okay i think it's uh

2128
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,920
it's really interesting uh

2129
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,440
yeah unfortunately we don't have much

2130
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:51,199
time to discuss

2131
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:52,960
uh i think uh yeah there is a

2132
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:54,480
is there also some overlaps as you say

2133
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,040
with what you are doing in the other

2134
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:58,080
document

2135
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,560
you know in the group and also some that

2136
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:01,280
we can

2137
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,840
i think really also benefit from each

2138
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,280
other from the different ideas and uh

2139
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:08,400
um i think it's it's really now we don't

2140
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,440
have any time to without

2141
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:13,120
it but i would really like if we can uh

2142
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,799
in the next meeting if we can already

2143
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:17,280
arrange more time to to

2144
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,040
discuss a bit more what you present here

2145
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:22,000
and also a very

2146
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:23,600
dedicated meeting to ai injury meeting

2147
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:28,239
because i think it's

2148
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:28,239
it's too short now too much content

2149
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,840
yeah i'm sorry

2150
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:39,360
um so maybe you move to the next uh

2151
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,679
to the next ethan and of course anyway

2152
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:46,320
we can also discuss then on gather

2153
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:47,280
i think we have time so the next is my

2154
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:59,840
presentation

2155
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:59,840
so let me share my screen

2156
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:07,199
and okay

2157
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:15,280
so i will tell you to keep it sharp um

2158
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:21,679
so yes i represent the uh status of the

2159
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,840
document and research challenge in a ai

2160
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:26,560
for network management

2161
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,639
um so just really a quick update so as

2162
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:32,159
you so we have here the link for the

2163
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:35,440
google doc um so basically we

2164
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:36,960
started to work on this document by uh

2165
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,638
drafting some challenges that people

2166
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,920
have in mind and we have several

2167
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,679
several ones and some regarding

2168
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:45,679
similar to what one presented before

2169
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:46,400
regarding data regarding ai technique

2170
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:48,159
including

2171
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,599
your mind keeping human in the blue

2172
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:52,000
panther

2173
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,280
recently we have a new challenge that

2174
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,800
has been purple there's some slight

2175
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:56,080
modification to a new one as a new

2176
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,600
proper channel

2177
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,519
regarding scalable or real-time

2178
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,000
monitoring so really

2179
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:03,679
it's just an extract of this channel

2180
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,360
that has been proposed

2181
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:08,400
uh there are some comments that have

2182
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:11,440
been raised uh

2183
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:12,799
because i mean this is one was regarding

2184
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:15,120
what is the specificity of the

2185
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:18,159
challenger into network management

2186
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:21,519
why existing techniques let's say for uh

2187
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:23,040
real-time analysis of let's say big data

2188
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,639
ethereum attack cannot work

2189
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:26,880
and try to figure out why it's so

2190
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,760
different in our domain that

2191
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,760
some of the comments

2192
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:38,320
we had uh virtual meetings in november

2193
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:40,800
to discuss mostly the scope and rgt us

2194
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,799
document

2195
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,239
one major discussion point was regarding

2196
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:45,840
let's say the scope so and the

2197
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:47,440
boundaries of the documents

2198
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,040
both from the network management

2199
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,719
perspective and from

2200
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:54,480
the artificial intelligence perspective

2201
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:56,000
mostly we say that we should not we

2202
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,440
should not focus on particle application

2203
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,360
domains or problems

2204
01:33:57,440 --> 01:34:01,040
and as we already said we don't want to

2205
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,400
have this document to be a collection of

2206
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,560
use case

2207
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:06,719
um although one problem we're getting

2208
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:08,639
that's one issue was getting ai what we

2209
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,800
think what we mean by ai in document

2210
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:14,000
it's very important to clarify

2211
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:16,560
uh we mostly

2212
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,239
mostly have in mind machine learning but

2213
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,679
still there is uh

2214
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:21,280
some some challenges that you could

2215
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:24,239
describe in uh regarding

2216
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:25,040
other techniques from ai so we should be

2217
01:34:24,239 --> 01:34:27,120
clear on

2218
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:28,560
what are the boundaries of ai if you

2219
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:29,679
want to integrate everything in the

2220
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:31,360
camera or not we don't have

2221
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:33,280
the answer yet but you have to be clear

2222
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,880
also use really a precise time because

2223
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,120
the document

2224
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,800
should be also let's say not only for us

2225
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:39,440
but also for ai expert and should be

2226
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:44,840
developed

2227
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:47,199
in conjunction with ai expert

2228
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:50,000
um we also want to

2229
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:52,080
highlight the uh in the comments before

2230
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,280
addressing we have challenges i like why

2231
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,040
we have these challenges

2232
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:56,559
what makes the basically network

2233
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:59,040
management

2234
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:59,040
problems

2235
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,760
why is this these problems will require

2236
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,440
artificial intelligence

2237
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,280
because of course there are maybe

2238
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:09,599
different uh

2239
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:12,000
answers to that because we have uh too

2240
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:14,560
many to complex data too much towards

2241
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,159
the data we need fast decision and so on

2242
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,040
and we cannot just rely on human

2243
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:19,119
response so there are

2244
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:20,239
some introduction content that has been

2245
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:22,159
proposed

2246
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:24,239
and although maybe these are also new

2247
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,360
problems that we can solve with ai that

2248
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:26,879
we don't think before

2249
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,719
and also i think it's something that you

2250
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,040
are highlight lauren your presentation

2251
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,040
before

2252
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:35,920
we really discuss what which should be

2253
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,199
the value of the document in order to

2254
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,679
refine the scope and ability of the

2255
01:35:37,199 --> 01:35:39,678
document

2256
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:45,920
we what has been raised that uh

2257
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:47,360
which the idea that what we see today is

2258
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,360
that there is a lot of a test and trial

2259
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,080
method in the fantasy research paper for

2260
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,000
example

2261
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:53,440
we just take different methods of ai to

2262
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,040
apply to our problem and say okay this

2263
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:57,040
method works better or we add

2264
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,560
we want something uh we want basically

2265
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,000
to have that that

2266
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,080
rather than having a trust and try

2267
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,360
method help people to really identify

2268
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:08,880
what are the issue when they

2269
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,040
want to apply ai to their problem in

2270
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,920
order to

2271
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:15,199
have a better guidance on how they can

2272
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:16,800
apply aha

2273
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:18,559
so basically we want to make the breed

2274
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,119
between a network engine problem and

2275
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,560
isolation so that is a proposition now

2276
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:24,799
everything is

2277
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,960
still discussed there are different

2278
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,880
obstacles so we discuss a lot about what

2279
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,239
ai techniques for world problems but of

2280
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,880
course it's just only one

2281
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:33,440
one issue when you that trying to find

2282
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:37,520
the right

2283
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:37,519
let's say ai algorithm for your problem

2284
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,880
it's only one issue and there is other

2285
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:42,800
other obstacles

2286
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,159
for example organic explainability uh

2287
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:47,280
education

2288
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:49,440
uh auto usea ai and so on so

2289
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,559
it's not about technical let's say issue

2290
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,320
as well

2291
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,639
we don't want as i said before we don't

2292
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,599
want to document the set of use cases we

2293
01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:57,920
don't want to be

2294
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,280
as documented as a survey between what

2295
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,560
has been used for the different network

2296
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:03,040
management programs

2297
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,880
uh otherwise it will be always unless we

2298
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,280
i think we will never reach a consensus

2299
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,639
so

2300
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:10,080
what should be the right technique for

2301
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,080
others in each problem

2302
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:15,678
and we finally

2303
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,719
i tried to put in the document let's say

2304
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,840
a scope

2305
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:21,280
or tentative scope following this this

2306
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,600
meeting that here's here it just the

2307
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:27,119
next price we can see the full

2308
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:29,440
proposal in the google doc um

2309
01:37:27,119 --> 01:37:31,839
but basically we want also to have a a

2310
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,678
method on top of the challenges

2311
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,199
in order to identify those challenges

2312
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:36,000
rather than saying that we have

2313
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:37,759
challenges

2314
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,360
of course we we know that we have that

2315
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:41,119
maybe we would also have a method and

2316
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:44,080
check if we cover

2317
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:45,199
uh all important or all relevant

2318
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,960
challenges

2319
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,960
and that is also the idea of the

2320
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,239
document or a method

2321
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:53,679
i want that and yes the objective of the

2322
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:56,159
documents for the reader is

2323
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,040
justify set of challenges so i mean it's

2324
01:37:56,159 --> 01:37:59,599
important that the

2325
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:00,719
challenges are justified and just

2326
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:04,560
actually in that

2327
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,560
because we things are important

2328
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:08,239
and maybe sometimes better also or it's

2329
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,239
easier to define what

2330
01:38:08,239 --> 01:38:11,678
the document should not be uh it's so

2331
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:13,119
it's a bit of summary of what i said

2332
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:14,560
before it's not a survey of

2333
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:16,559
the use of a technique in network

2334
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:20,320
management not the mapping

2335
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:22,560
between techniques we it's not a yeah

2336
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:24,480
again a use case document and we don't

2337
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:27,280
expect in the ground to provide answer

2338
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:29,759
solution to all challenges that we will

2339
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,759
introduce

2340
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,480
next step uh i would like to have in the

2341
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:38,400
next couple of weeks

2342
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,400
to have the scope fixed so

2343
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:42,639
of course you can give now as a feedback

2344
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,159
on the scope of the document

2345
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:46,239
that was on the mailing list we'll have

2346
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:49,679
more maybe uh interaction more time

2347
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:51,440
on the mailing list as well and then yes

2348
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:53,679
on the scope of the document this fix we

2349
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:54,159
can reframe the method to identify the

2350
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,199
challenge

2351
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:58,719
and although we also supported that

2352
01:38:57,199 --> 01:39:00,638
challenge are described in a really

2353
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,719
different level of detail so we need

2354
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:03,600
some kind of a korean description to run

2355
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,800
content

2356
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,159
into the different document

2357
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,159
although there is discussion should we

2358
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:12,799
continue the google document or

2359
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:14,559
draft so i will also let's say do a poll

2360
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,480
on that in the year

2361
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,520
in in the mailing list to see what will

2362
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:22,239
be the people preference

2363
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,719
and with that i'm done so uh i think if

2364
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:26,400
you have

2365
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:41,840
any uh quick question or comment we

2366
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:41,839
can take now

2367
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:49,440
okay so if there is a any comment now

2368
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:51,759
i think we can we can move to the next

2369
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,759
point

2370
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:59,520
the agenda that that is

2371
01:39:55,440 --> 01:40:03,360
uh so multi multi-level configuration

2372
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:03,360
the presentation will be given by luis

2373
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:09,679
yes hello you want to share the slide

2374
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:12,239
right for you yes yes please

2375
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,880
so luis may i ask you to speed up a bit

2376
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:18,239
your presentation to keep in

2377
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:23,360
five minutes thank you

2378
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:23,360
i will try let me uh

2379
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:32,400
i'm really sorry that uh

2380
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:34,400
okay no no problem okay so the

2381
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:36,638
first uh to mention well i will present

2382
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:39,759
that one on behalf of my co-authors

2383
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:40,560
ian bogdanovich and sufan liu from from

2384
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:43,440
bolton

2385
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:44,239
and maybe you can recall the this topic

2386
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,119
was uh

2387
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:48,320
authorized in in the mailing list some

2388
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:50,320
propositions from

2389
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:52,080
the end and then we start discussing on

2390
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,400
top of that and the result was

2391
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:57,679
this document that i will present right

2392
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:57,679
now so next slide please

2393
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:04,719
so essentially the motivation will be

2394
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:07,839
how to to handle the

2395
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:09,280
the situations that we see in in in

2396
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,719
operational networks where

2397
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:15,440
essentially a a number of

2398
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:16,880
device configurations uh grow and grow

2399
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:20,799
along the time

2400
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:22,480
and it's quite difficult to to have a

2401
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,080
clean uh configuration a base

2402
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,718
configuration and

2403
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:28,719
essentially we we have let's say

2404
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:31,760
residual configurations alone

2405
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:33,840
so which are motivated by different

2406
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,080
reasons for instance debugging these

2407
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:37,280
sessions uh in order to solve problems

2408
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,719
that where the

2409
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:41,599
the people operating the network start

2410
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:44,080
configuring things dynamic evolution of

2411
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,520
protocols or peers or whatever where you

2412
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:49,040
maybe could

2413
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:51,760
been person b sessions that later on are

2414
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:52,880
left there without traffic or something

2415
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,679
things of

2416
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:56,880
this kind of things okay so uh

2417
01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:00,960
essentially all the

2418
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:03,600
configuration information is uh finally

2419
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,600
present in a single file a plain file so

2420
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,679
all this multiplex there somehow

2421
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,760
which is hard to manage and even though

2422
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,679
there are solutions proposing

2423
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,119
central databases with all the network

2424
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:15,360
configuration files that could be

2425
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:17,119
persistent on timeline so

2426
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,880
this does not resolve the problem at all

2427
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:20,239
so we would like to look at this from a

2428
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,040
different angle that is the one that we

2429
01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:29,839
will present

2430
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:29,840
in the next slides so next one please

2431
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:40,320
so you know can you go to next one

2432
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:43,840
please

2433
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:48,159
hello can you hear me

2434
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,040
yes i can hear you uh okay there is an

2435
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:57,119
issue on

2436
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:57,119
jerome's side i don't know okay

2437
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:06,879
okay okay so where this multi-level

2438
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:08,960
configuration could help so we have

2439
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,719
identified a number of use cases we will

2440
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:12,080
go through more detail for the service

2441
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:12,639
assurance and never slicing in the

2442
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,360
following

2443
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:16,400
slides but i will briefly comment here

2444
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,920
so another two

2445
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,599
the like the network migrations are

2446
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,440
merging so essentially

2447
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:23,119
in all these procedures which are quite

2448
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:26,320
complex

2449
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:29,519
if we need to go directly through the

2450
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:32,320
plane file having all the configuration

2451
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:33,840
this is actually hard so probably having

2452
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,400
this multi-level configuration could

2453
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,159
help

2454
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,519
at the time of migrating and or merging

2455
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:38,000
networks in such a way that we could

2456
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,679
divide

2457
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,560
the problem in small pieces and

2458
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:45,440
targeting those pieces in a more easiest

2459
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:46,320
way and also the zero touch provisioning

2460
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:49,119
in the sense that

2461
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:49,920
once we deploy some device and so we

2462
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:52,239
could

2463
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:53,600
perform this incremental configuration

2464
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:57,440
in pieces as well

2465
01:43:53,600 --> 01:44:00,560
so making it much more easy to handle

2466
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:02,480
we will go now now to the next two so

2467
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,719
the service assurance and our slicing

2468
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,678
to have more detail on that service

2469
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:08,159
assurance uh

2470
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:09,119
you all of you are aware of the the

2471
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,719
draft from

2472
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:12,880
benue that has been presented several

2473
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,840
times here about the service and syrian

2474
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,719
architecture

2475
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,199
so basically this uh this graph proposed

2476
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:19,920
a

2477
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:20,879
cross control loop that could modify the

2478
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:22,639
the configuration

2479
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,719
in real time the running configuration

2480
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:27,920
according to different intents and

2481
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:29,920
operational states so this could imply a

2482
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,840
lot of dynamic configuration changes

2483
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,960
and here we do foresee the role of this

2484
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,480
multi-level

2485
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,719
configuration in the sense that could

2486
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,879
help on identifying

2487
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:40,320
by design from the starting of the

2488
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:42,800
configuration the correlation among

2489
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,159
those services and atomic functions

2490
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,840
in the network in such a way that we

2491
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:46,400
could have somehow the hooks or the

2492
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,920
links

2493
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:50,000
between the different pieces for

2494
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,719
supporting this service assurance

2495
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,320
approach

2496
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:57,280
in in this let's say lighter way

2497
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,280
next slide please

2498
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,920
regarding slicing here the the concept

2499
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,159
also

2500
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,080
applies straightforward in the sense

2501
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:08,400
that in the slice concept we will have

2502
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:11,280
either slices being hierarchical

2503
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,400
so covering more than one layer or even

2504
01:45:11,280 --> 01:45:13,679
on the same layer

2505
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,599
basically taking profit of the

2506
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:18,719
recursivity so one slice could be

2507
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:22,000
sliced at the same time okay and now

2508
01:45:18,719 --> 01:45:24,239
also the the the

2509
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,520
sequential slicing so the stitching of

2510
01:45:24,239 --> 01:45:27,360
the slices and so

2511
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,280
the multi-level configuration here could

2512
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:32,000
be easily

2513
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,599
us as a point in order to understand

2514
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,239
that each of the slices that we will

2515
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,239
deploy

2516
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:38,320
will be essentially one of these levels

2517
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:40,400
if we have on top of that some hierarchy

2518
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:43,040
or some recursiveness

2519
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:43,599
we could also apply this level on top of

2520
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,440
the

2521
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,880
existing levels and making it

2522
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:49,839
incremental

2523
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,840
next slide please

2524
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:54,159
so here you can see a an easy example so

2525
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,400
you we could have

2526
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:58,000
a baseline an underlying infrastructure

2527
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,679
that could be the figure at the bottom

2528
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,679
and on top of that trigger to deploy

2529
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,920
different slices so do each of these

2530
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:06,239
slices will be represented by these

2531
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,040
different levels of configuration so we

2532
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:09,280
have there

2533
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,080
the blue on the left and the red on on

2534
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,000
the right

2535
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,000
so this would be essentially two level

2536
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,480
of configurations on top of the

2537
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,760
base uh configuration that would be the

2538
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,040
one marking black

2539
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,800
at the bottom so essentially the black

2540
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,040
one would be the persistent in case of

2541
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,080
whatever outage or issue in the network

2542
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:27,760
we will recover that

2543
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,080
black one while the red and the blue

2544
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:33,280
could be later on deployed on top of the

2545
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,600
of the black in an easier way next slide

2546
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,599
please

2547
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,719
so the proposal essentially is a

2548
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:43,280
visually you can see

2549
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:44,320
what would be the idea on the figure so

2550
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:46,960
essentially having

2551
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:49,040
these different levels of configuration

2552
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:50,639
and you can associate that to multiple

2553
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:52,639
panes of glass

2554
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,880
in such a way that you could start doing

2555
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:55,280
incremental things linking these things

2556
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,920
uh

2557
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:58,559
associating these things to the multiple

2558
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:02,080
levels

2559
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:05,119
in such a way that you can grow or scale

2560
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,400
i mean a skill up or scale down into the

2561
01:47:05,119 --> 01:47:08,880
configuration depending on

2562
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:10,719
um yeah as long as the time and being

2563
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:11,920
sure that the persistent information is

2564
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:15,040
is kept

2565
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:18,239
uh and so how even though we would

2566
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:19,600
keep you having this plain figure to

2567
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:21,519
start linking let's say these multi

2568
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:23,920
levels and such however we can operate

2569
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:25,040
in a in a more easiest way having so

2570
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,760
divided the problem

2571
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:28,639
essentially and having this incremental

2572
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:30,000
approach

2573
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:32,159
each level can be handled in an

2574
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,960
independent manner so we will

2575
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:35,759
minimize the impact in other levels and

2576
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,159
this applies

2577
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,040
fully for the case of a slicing for

2578
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,920
instance

2579
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:43,440
um and each level will be autonomous and

2580
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,920
comparative and this following

2581
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:47,440
applies a very very straightforward to

2582
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,040
the service assurance case

2583
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:50,638
as well as the other two the mergings

2584
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,080
and and the cello touch

2585
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:53,840
for the mergers for instance you can see

2586
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:55,280
over there or the migration

2587
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:56,960
we could take one of these pieces

2588
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:59,599
individually and start migrating

2589
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,719
part by part instead of touching all the

2590
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:05,840
configuration

2591
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:05,840
at once so next slide please

2592
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:10,880
so uh we have presented this to the

2593
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:14,159
routine market group as well as

2594
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:15,600
also here so we expect to

2595
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:18,159
work in completing the description of

2596
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,679
the proposals and identify viable viable

2597
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:22,480
solutions and approaches so this

2598
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:24,320
is yet an idea we need to land this idea

2599
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:25,599
to something much more concrete

2600
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,360
and for sure we would like to collect

2601
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:30,239
feedback and comments from

2602
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:33,360
from the research group and for sure we

2603
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:35,599
will prepare a new version for next itf

2604
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:38,719
so apologies for the being a hurry but i

2605
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:38,719
would like to save time

2606
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:49,360
thanks luis yeah thanks a lot luis

2607
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,360
yes

2608
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,119
hi just a quick question is um it might

2609
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,960
be worth presenting this

2610
01:48:55,119 --> 01:49:00,320
also in net mod um and i wanted to ask

2611
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:02,800
whether

2612
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:03,920
you're aware of the nmda architecture

2613
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:07,119
the network

2614
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,800
um data store architecture used

2615
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:10,960
for netconf because that already had the

2616
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:13,360
idea of separate data stores

2617
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:14,000
uh representing different types of data

2618
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,400
within network

2619
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,040
configuration and it may be worth

2620
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,598
looking at

2621
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,560
whether you could use separate data

2622
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:22,480
stores

2623
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:24,719
to manage these different layers and

2624
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,480
then the interesting questions become

2625
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,320
about how do you merge that that

2626
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,000
configuration data together

2627
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,599
and a separate interesting question is

2628
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,679
about um

2629
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,199
how do you map the operational state

2630
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:37,280
data back again

2631
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:39,040
uh given that when the underlying device

2632
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,639
is going to see a merged view of that

2633
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:43,840
configuration but that might be an

2634
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:43,840
approach that's worth considering

2635
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:51,919
thanks so much for the comment and let

2636
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:56,000
me eat internally with my offers

2637
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:59,360
and oh i think dean is there so maybe

2638
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,360
can comment on this

2639
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:09,759
yes hey hey robert on the

2640
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:12,239
nmda data stores it is fine

2641
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:13,840
as long you don't try to create

2642
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:15,440
management separations

2643
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,290
because the idea there is that you can

2644
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:18,400
have a completely separate

2645
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:21,280
[Music]

2646
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,598
owners from the management perspective

2647
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:24,880
of

2648
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:28,639
parts of the configuration so

2649
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:31,840
uh we looked into that but uh we haven't

2650
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:33,840
finalized it but based from

2651
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,760
from the initial looks what we saw that

2652
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:39,280
there are some

2653
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:42,960
there are some missings

2654
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:44,559
in the nmda that uh allowed complete the

2655
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,599
figuration

2656
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:47,599
management operation

2657
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:54,320
so so dan just to reply to that is that

2658
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,880
um

2659
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:58,000
things like the nakam side the access

2660
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:01,760
control that you

2661
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,760
have a particular concern about

2662
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:10,800
um it is not

2663
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:14,800
just the access control it is

2664
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:17,599
i want to be a viewed as a completely

2665
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,599
separate owner

2666
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:21,840
okay

2667
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:32,400
okay thank you uh thank you for the

2668
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:34,159
the comments and questions uh

2669
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:35,519
and thank you luis again for the

2670
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:38,159
presentation so

2671
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:39,199
let's now move to the uh the last

2672
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:42,000
meeting

2673
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:44,080
um that is an update on the concept of

2674
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,760
digital network so i think the promotion

2675
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:48,800
is

2676
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:51,440
done by a zoo and

2677
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:51,440
jiggle right

2678
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:58,719
yeah i think so i

2679
01:51:56,480 --> 01:52:00,839
i don't know which one has to start i'm

2680
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:04,400
happy

2681
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:04,400
so okay

2682
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,719
should i start are you going to start

2683
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:10,639
it's it's fine to me

2684
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,760
well if you make the introduction i will

2685
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,760
make the comments on the

2686
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:19,920
extra

2687
01:52:16,239 --> 01:52:22,879
hi cheers uh diego i think i can

2688
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,760
uh prepare most of them and uh how uh

2689
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,960
ask

2690
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:30,639
dave to uh to free to present uh

2691
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:34,159
slides three or n4 okay

2692
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:36,239
so uh i think we can start and this is

2693
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:39,199
chen zhou from china mobile and today

2694
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:41,360
uh uh diego lopez and i will join

2695
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:44,559
jointly presents the draft update

2696
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:45,679
um of the concept of digital tree

2697
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,400
network

2698
01:52:45,679 --> 01:52:48,400
last slide please

2699
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:55,119
okay in uh meeting 108 we introduced the

2700
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:58,239
initial version of the draft

2701
01:52:55,119 --> 01:52:59,119
in including the definition of benefits

2702
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:02,080
and the challenges of

2703
01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:02,400
digio2 network since last update there

2704
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:06,239
are

2705
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:08,879
three major updates from initial version

2706
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:10,320
the first two updates were provided by

2707
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,920
diva locus

2708
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:17,199
and antenna of pasteur from telefonica

2709
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:20,320
and uh uh they are about uh adding

2710
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:23,759
uh refine any annual fixed

2711
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:26,880
element to the klm names

2712
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:29,920
orchestration and added

2713
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:33,119
two more benefits in section

2714
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:37,119
three and the third

2715
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:39,839
and the third updates is we added a

2716
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:42,080
new section for reference architecture

2717
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:45,199
of digital network

2718
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:45,199
let's slide pete peace

2719
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:53,040
so uh diego i do your flow thank you

2720
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:54,718
yeah yeah if you look at the well this

2721
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:57,199
is the original diagram

2722
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:57,920
with these orchestration elements added

2723
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:01,678
on the uh

2724
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:04,480
at the bottom right um basically

2725
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:05,440
the idea is that well since the we

2726
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:09,440
believe that

2727
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:12,638
we should add some uh

2728
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:13,678
some mechanism for controlling the data

2729
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:23,840
and action flows

2730
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:23,840
i mean

2731
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:51,440
um brief of the of the twin

2732
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:53,520
so uh well on one hand you you're able

2733
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:57,119
to uh

2734
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:58,800
to warranty uh uh repeatability so you

2735
01:54:57,119 --> 01:55:00,239
can replicate network conditions on

2736
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:02,159
demand don't necessarily

2737
01:55:00,239 --> 01:55:03,759
exactly the same that are happening in a

2738
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:06,080
certain moment so you can have

2739
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:07,679
several as i said several let's say uh

2740
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:10,080
individual twins

2741
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:11,119
and you have uh the possibility of

2742
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:13,599
reproduce

2743
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:14,960
by replaying the section of events under

2744
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,000
control variations

2745
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:19,760
it is that you have a much better uh

2746
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,119
with it with the train you have a much

2747
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,280
better way of

2748
01:55:21,119 --> 01:55:25,360
managing or dealing with different

2749
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:28,960
choices alternatives or

2750
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:29,519
or or situations that may happen and uh

2751
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,719
for sure

2752
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:33,760
to for these to be useful is something

2753
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:35,920
that you need a

2754
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,520
good network model that allows you to

2755
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:46,480
make this orchestration

2756
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:48,400
in a reasonable time next one so

2757
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:50,159
apart from that uh when talking about

2758
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,799
the digits of doing we we

2759
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:53,519
found and some internal discussions that

2760
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,960
there were

2761
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:59,119
other at least two potential benefits

2762
01:55:56,960 --> 01:56:00,400
for the moment we probably i don't know

2763
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:02,639
if we uh

2764
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,519
with the as the work go on we will

2765
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:06,880
identify

2766
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:08,320
another ones basically one is about uh

2767
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,239
privacy preservation

2768
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:12,480
everything that happens in the dream

2769
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:13,360
every every processing that you may have

2770
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:16,559
in the train

2771
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:18,799
with the external uh ally with external

2772
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:18,800
um

2773
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,239
modules or external elements and

2774
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:30,159
the it is based on data that is filtered

2775
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:31,360
by the twin and in many cases

2776
01:56:30,159 --> 01:56:34,080
synthesizes

2777
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:34,639
synthesized by the by the thing so it's

2778
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:37,920
much

2779
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:40,400
better it allows us to

2780
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:43,199
deal with the data process the data

2781
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:46,799
apply the knowledge without

2782
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:50,320
violating privacy requirements

2783
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:51,040
and and and this is something that as

2784
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,960
well

2785
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:55,519
is connected as well with the idea that

2786
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:57,360
for example when dealing and this

2787
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:58,880
a concern in natural management right

2788
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,960
now is about what happens when when

2789
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:03,040
end-to-end encryptions become completely

2790
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,840
progressive and via

2791
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:07,440
and the network uh management mechanisms

2792
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,880
are become a little bit

2793
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,919
a little bit quite blinder than they are

2794
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:15,760
right now

2795
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:17,520
and so with this idea of adding or

2796
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:20,159
enhancing the training with the

2797
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,159
possibility

2798
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,159
we could be we should be able to deal

2799
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:39,840
with them and

2800
01:57:24,159 --> 01:57:39,839
before that and this is a

2801
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:55,280
we are we are using it in uh well we are

2802
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,599
developing a project for

2803
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,119
doing with cyber ranges in which people

2804
01:57:57,599 --> 01:58:00,960
may play

2805
01:57:59,119 --> 01:58:02,719
at the different conditions and security

2806
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,199
evaluations and all the like and

2807
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:06,960
we have as well a devaluation of

2808
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:09,759
different chests

2809
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:11,679
and i hand it over to you sorry yeah you

2810
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,000
may need ready to speed up because uh

2811
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:15,440
the session will close in two minutes we

2812
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:21,760
we really need to see the

2813
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:24,400
conclusion on this sorry

2814
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:25,119
so can you move on here to the next one

2815
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,239
so

2816
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:30,320
it's uh okay okay

2817
01:58:28,239 --> 01:58:31,598
uh let's might take the turn uh let me

2818
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:34,320
type uh i'll take this

2819
01:58:31,599 --> 01:58:36,320
uh slides uh shows the reference tech

2820
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:38,880
architecture of gtn system

2821
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:39,679
and it can be designed as a three layer

2822
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,080
system

2823
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:47,440
the bottom layer is a physical network

2824
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:49,840
sorry the previous

2825
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:49,839
page

2826
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:56,719
oh yes and our bottom layer is physical

2827
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:58,880
network physical network can be of wears

2828
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:01,199
type including telecommunication

2829
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:02,080
operator network the sensor network

2830
01:59:01,199 --> 01:59:05,280
campus network

2831
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:07,199
etc and all network elements and

2832
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:08,800
and equipments in physical network

2833
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:11,919
exchange massive network data

2834
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:15,280
and the control messages

2835
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:18,159
with digital twin uh entity via

2836
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:20,239
southbound interface a middle layer is

2837
01:59:18,159 --> 01:59:23,440
network digital twin

2838
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:26,480
it is the code of detail system

2839
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:29,598
this layer includes three key subsystems

2840
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:31,598
data showing the repository source

2841
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,760
matching models and the digital team

2842
01:59:31,599 --> 01:59:36,560
entity management

2843
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:37,360
network digital entity layer gets

2844
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,599
servicing

2845
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:40,639
requirements from network applications

2846
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:43,119
then

2847
01:59:40,639 --> 01:59:45,040
take simulations by service model

2848
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:47,360
instances

2849
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:48,960
then after four or four full

2850
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:51,519
verification

2851
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:52,480
the change controls can be deployed

2852
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,599
safely

2853
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:56,159
to the physical network under the top

2854
01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:58,639
layer

2855
01:59:56,159 --> 01:59:59,679
is a network application layer of both

2856
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:02,960
conventional and

2857
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:03,679
innovative applications can run against

2858
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:06,719
the dtm

2859
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:09,760
platform with low cost and less

2860
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:12,239
service impact on real network

2861
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:13,040
network management network applications

2862
02:00:12,239 --> 02:00:16,638
provides

2863
02:00:13,040 --> 02:00:18,000
requirements to network digital training

2864
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:23,360
entities while

2865
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:23,360
northbound interfaces next page please

2866
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:27,360
i may ask you to go to maybe the

2867
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:31,598
conclusion now because we have to

2868
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:34,719
close the meeting in normally now sorry

2869
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:38,159
