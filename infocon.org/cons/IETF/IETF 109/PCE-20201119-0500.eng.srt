good evening

15
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,479
this is the past competition i'm on

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,680
walking group session

17
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,679
welcome to bangkok

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,000
so i guess

19
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,479
everyone should be aware of the usual

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,680
not well

21
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,399
basically very brief summary

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,840
everything that you may say share or

23
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
comment during

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
the ahf meetings are subject to the

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,720
noteworth

26
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,360
on the associated ipr policy so please

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
if you weren't familiar with those look

28
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
at the

29
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,079
pointers that are included there and

30
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
make sure that you understand

31
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,279
and follow them

32
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,840
next please try

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,160
okay so i guess that harry is already

34
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,640
taking

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,640
minutes

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,280
using the kodi md tool

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,800
if you want to give a hand i think

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,640
you should be able to access if you have

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:38,080
a data account so feel free to

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,079
to help harry if you feel like it

41
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
we're still there already and this is

42
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
the

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
this isn't the first online itf meeting

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,280
so you should be familiar with the

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
mythical tool but a short reminder

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,040
that you have a tool to

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
manage the queue so in case you have a

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,480
question you join the queue

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,599
on the rev and i will give you the floor

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,720
at the time you feel ready to

51
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,959
hear your comments and remember

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,640
that we're on record so as usual

53
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,200
start your speech by including your your

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,799
name

55
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,040
before you give your comment

56
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,239
uh as a reminder as well

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,079
so this is the kind of substitute to the

58
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,920
face-to-face meeting

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,519
to discuss topics and

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,440
create some communication between

61
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
working group members but keep in mind

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,720
that we also have the mailing list that

63
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,238
is open

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,680
24 7 so feel free to use it even after

65
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,720
the meeting if there are some

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,640
unresolved questions or painting issues

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:03,280
the meeting is still there anytime

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,279
next please

69
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,560
usual also a

70
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,160
reminder about the working good

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,720
processes

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,040
especially during calls for

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,360
draft adoption or working group last

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,320
call

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,479
to judge about the consensus on the

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,120
document and decision we need to see

77
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,120
as much as

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,800
visible views and opinions

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,759
on the mailing list so make sure that

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
when you have something to say you write

81
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
it down

82
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,000
using an email and

83
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,639
try to get involved in

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
as much as adoptions or working group

85
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
last calls as much as possible

86
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,198
this is very useful for chairs even phil

87
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,360
you you think that

88
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
your point of view is already similar to

89
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
someone else

90
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,080
adding yours is always useful to coach

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,680
about the interest

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,719
or the lack of support for

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,680
new topics or

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,680
stable ids

95
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,240
next please so we have a wiki

96
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,000
it's been set up for a while it includes

97
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
very useful information about the

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
various skills

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
of document that we manage

100
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,840
[Music]

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:41,599
feel free to read it and

102
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,320
update it in case your document has been

103
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,320
mistakenly

104
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
added in the wrong place or forgotten or

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
as

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,440
progress that isn't reflected in the

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,960
wiki

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,680
it's available on a sharing tool

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,000
as well so it's supposed to reflect some

110
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
of the

111
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
the documents that we have in our

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
various queues so

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
make sure it reflects the current state

114
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,960
in case your document

115
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,440
isn't in that position you may

116
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
help in updating that wiki

117
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,520
reminder about the holy cut pointer

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
location

119
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,599
we see from time to time some requests

120
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
for

121
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,199
cut points on documents

122
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,800
we manage our record point allocation

123
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:41,440
only starting from working group ids

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,919
not on individual drafts

125
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
there are some prerequisites to request

126
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,680
a location

127
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:54,239
on the we have a process to to follow

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,240
to trigger an only point allocation

129
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
make sure that you have gathered all the

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,638
preconditions before you request another

131
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,239
point allocation

132
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:10,000
on as soon as it

133
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,800
everything is okay we'll

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,919
start the associated process if the

135
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,360
working group

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,799
agrees with that so keep in mind that

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
this is something that

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,039
may be worst effort on some

139
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
cases but not always because it also has

140
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,318
some

141
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,080
a couple of drawbacks so make sure that

142
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,880
in your

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,359
case it makes the this sense that you

144
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
expect and

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,960
will reflect those in the

146
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,840
wiki as well so you may also have a look

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,638
at

148
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,638
our current list which is empty so far

149
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:02,639
agenda so it's been shared for a while

150
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,240
but usual question does anyone has

151
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
anything to bash on the agenda

152
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,120
i don't see anyone in the queue so

153
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
we'll assume that it's okay and we'll

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,199
proceed with this agenda

155
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,198
so rough you want to take the floor from

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,318
there

157
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,880
so we have uh two rfcs since

158
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
uh iit of 108 we have the diversity

159
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,599
association

160
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,240
and the lsp scheduling rfc is published

161
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,519
we have one rfc which is waiting in the

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,560
rfc editor queue

163
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,360
currently it's misrep to the idr

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,680
flowspec documents so once we have that

165
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
this will get published as well

166
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,079
we have the association policy that we

167
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,680
did the working group last call and we

168
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,600
have sent this to our ad

169
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,920
and we are waiting for routing direct

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,320
rate and ad review

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
to further progress these documents

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,120
which are beyond the

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,440
working group during

174
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,160
the two meetings we processed three

175
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,760
irata's

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,120
uh uh both on stateful pce and pc

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,160
initiated documents uh these were pretty

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
straightforward

179
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,000
uh we we posted the resolution on the

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
mailing list

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
there wasn't any complaints so after

182
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,880
discussing between chairs and ad we have

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
gone ahead

184
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,839
and verified all of these there is a

185
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
early ima location that we made some

186
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,640
time back which is for association

187
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
policy

188
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
uh good thing is that's already uh out

189
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
of the working group

190
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,160
so everything is good so if you have any

191
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,640
other document

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,719
and you need a code pointer location as

193
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,839
julian was saying we have a process

194
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
please follow that

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
sorry so regarding liaison and

ongoing liaison with itu-t to

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,000
multiple working groups if you remember

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
from the last time we

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,200
we had an update of some of our

201
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,360
documents

202
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
as they are changing in all these

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,959
working groups so we updated the status

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
of those documents so that is

205
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
an ongoing layers on that will continue

206
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,880

over quickly the status of various

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,920
working group ids and next step

217
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
uh if you have any comments on these you

218

223
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
updated information please uh come to

224
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,480

and tell us so the documents which

226
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,959
are post working group last call we have

227
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,360
the pcc document

228
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,160
the shepard review was done by julian

229
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,480
authors have

230
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,399
made the update they were further two

231
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,120
comments from julian that authors are

232
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,959
saying

233
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,720
today morning that they will be handling

234
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,959
it so all's good

235
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,480
i think we would be able to send this

236
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,239
out of the working group

237
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
pretty soon regarding the bi-directional

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,160
association

239
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,480

240
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
get back

251
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,000
perfect

252
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
so the document which is nearing working

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
group last call

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,240
this is the pce yang document there are

255
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
two open issues that are listed in the

256
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,320
draft

257
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
one open issue is related to how do we

258
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,320
identify

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,959
in the t young model which of these lsps

260
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
are pc

261
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,079
initiated so that's one thing that we

262
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,199
haven't resolved that's been listed in

263
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,359
our as an issue

264
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
for a long time so it will be good to

265
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
get that resolved as well

266
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,200
another issue is the use of lspid as a

267
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
key

268
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,240
which is a reference to the pe young

269
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,399
model so as you know in psap we have

270
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
other path setup types as well so when

271
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,200
it is non-rsvp

272
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,600
how do we handle this lspid as a key is

273
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,920
a

274
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
issue which was recently identified so

275
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,199
this is something that

276
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,399
needs to be figured out so what we will

277
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,279
do is we will start

278
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
a email thread on the mailing list and

279
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,320
if

280
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
folks have any ideas on how to handle

281
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,600
this

282
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,199
uh that would be pretty useful

283
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,320
information so please provide that

284
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,959
information on the

285
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,200
mailing list we also noticed one thing

286
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,680
that we have an sr policy yang model

287
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,680
in spring uh we currently don't

288
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,839
reference it that's a pretty new model

289
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,199
and it will take some time to progress

290
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
as well so up

291
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,040
i personally feel that it might not be a

292
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,160
good idea to add a reference

293
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,000
to sr policy yang in this document we

294
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,160
can do it as an augmentation

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
in another document we have for instance

296
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
srv6 yang

297
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,479
document we can make it generic and

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,920
include both sr policy as well as

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,360
handling of srv6 in that id so again

300
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,319
this is something that would be good to

301
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,399
discuss on the list

302
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,560
uh we will start a thread uh on that

303
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,680
apart from that uh the t yang

304
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
dependencies

305
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,519
are progressing we have a dependency on

306
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,760
tls so

307
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,360
from netcon document those documents are

308
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,160
also in the pipeline so they will be

309
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,399
progressed

310
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,600
at the same time as this document is

311
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,160
getting ready

312
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
uh we have done a very early yank doctor

313
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,680
review

314
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,000
maybe we should evaluate if we should do

315
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,719
that

316
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,079
again at the same time while we are

317
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,079
thinking of

318
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,120
as this document needs working group

319
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,920
last call

320
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,040
if anybody has any comment on any of the

321
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,839
yang model stuff

322
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,839
uh floor is open

323
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,959
okay moving ahead please use the mailing

324
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
list i think that would be the better

325
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,439
place to

326
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,319
discuss this as well okay so some of the

327
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
other documents

328
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,079
we had a stateful gmpls document

329
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,440
there has been no update uh since the

330
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,079
last itf

331
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,000
uh if you remember we did a merging

332
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,359
between two documents stateful

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,600
gmpls and pc initiated stateful gmpls we

334
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,320
combine that into one document

335
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
so most of that combined work is done uh

336
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,720
there is

337
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,639
one thing pending which is the

338
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
implementation status

339
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
and since the document is expired anyway

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,519
we need a new revision

341
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,279
and moving this work along uh

342
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
any of the authors if they want to say

343
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,439
something please

344
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
uh you can otherwise i'll go ahead

345
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,880
okay the next one that we have is the

346
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,680
native ip

347
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,959
this one had multiple versions and

348
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,000
rework

349
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,800
between the two meetings request would

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,480
be that we

351
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,719
should keep the working group in loop

352
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,639
and not just mention that the update has

353
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,279
been made but also explain

354
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
uh why the changes have been made so

355
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,920
that's something

356
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,399
we need to take care in this document uh

357
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,199
also to note that in these working group

358
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,160
we have a related tease id

359
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,920
deborah has just asked the keys working

360
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,160
group to look into whether

361
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,199
the document status needs to change from

362
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,199
experimental to

363
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,120
informational so if you have any

364
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,000
thoughts on that please use the tease

365
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
mailing list

366
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,800
to discuss that uh we should also

367
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
evaluate that what we should do

368
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,120
about the pc document status right now

369
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,120
it's a proposed standard

370
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
so we should also have the parallely

371
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,839
evaluate and maybe

372
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,639
even the t's working group discussion

373
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,920
should be in input for us to evaluate

374
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,279
what should be the status

375
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,519
of uh the pc working group extension uh

376
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,880
as well as we need to coordinate with

377
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,839
the idr working group

378
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,839
related to any of the bgc stuff so for

379
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,600
facilitating that coordination it will

380
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,440
be good to have maybe a bgp

381
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,240
consideration section that describes

382
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,240
things

383
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
that the idr working group should look

384
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
at so they don't have to like you know

385
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
go through the whole document we can

386
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,240
condense and say that these are the bgp

387
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
consideration

388
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,440
that we are introducing as part of this

389
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
extension

390
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,759
so please look through and provide your

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,720
comments early on rather than

392
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,720
at a later stage i see itune in the

393
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,920

yeah yeah thank you so uh we will try to

395
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,439
you know make practice in your next

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,800
meeting for the

397
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,519
change of the craft uh because there are

398
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,279
some things

399
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:06,959
we are still in discussion you know

400
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:10,000
and for the uh pgp consideration

401
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,760
after the stable of the software will

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,359
uh seek the you know opinion from an

403
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,760
ideal working group

404
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
and uh

405
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,959
we want to also do the update based on

406
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,079
the

407
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,880
idea is his view for the uh

408
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,000
for the free moon framework document so

409
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,640
after the

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,720
this work this will be finished we can

411
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,760
update the pcep extension

412
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,919
dropped accordingly thank you okay thank

413
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,919
you

414
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,400
the next document is the enhanced error

415
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,000
document

416
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,559
uh this one had an update uh the update

417
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,520
uh uh moved the scenarios to the

418
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
appendix uh

419
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
so which was a good suggestion and

420
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,678
that's been accepted by the authors

421
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,080
uh they have also updated the guidelines

422
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
for other documents how to use

423
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,320
enhanced errors so i think the document

424
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
is progressing

425
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,600
if anybody has any comments i think

426
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,120
please use the mailing list

427
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,760
to provide that the next document that

428
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,639
we have

429
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
is the flex grid document there was an

430
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
update

431
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,399
they added an implementation status

432
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,520
section

433
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,320
the core of the document has not much

434
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,840
of the change so please feel free if

435
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,520
anybody has any comments for any of

436
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
these documents otherwise i'll continue

437
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,600
to

438
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,799
go on the next two are actually on

439
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,480
our agenda the srv6 and bindingset so we

440
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,480
can skip them

441
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,160
we have next two documents which is the

442
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,039
vn association

443
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
which had a keep alive update and we had

444
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,919
the

445
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,399
sr path segment that also had a keeper

446
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,160
like

447
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,200
uh update so if the authors thinks that

448
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,760
their documents

449
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,120
are stable they have nothing pending uh

450
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,960
they can let the working group

451
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,959
know about that as well

452
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,160
next we have sr bi-directional path

453
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,120
this one had an update they added

454
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,559
a scope clarification they also updated

455
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,520
based on the changes

456
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,120
in the rsvpte bi-directional documents

457
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
which is always good they updated the

458
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,760
figures notations

459
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,880
for clarity so thanks for that the

460
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,240
last document here that we have is the

461
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,160
uh is the segment routing uh sr policy

462
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,200
candidate path association

463
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,320
so the update was focused on changing in

464
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,600
the reserve value

465
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,720
of association id uh there was a mailing

466
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
list discussion

467
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
last week regarding the new procedure to

468
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,239
mandate

469
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
pcc's allocation of association

470
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
parameters

471
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
so that's ongoing if you have thoughts

472
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
on that

473
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
i think please use the mailing list and

474
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
provide

475
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,280
your thinking and we are looking forward

476
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,879
from authors and update

477
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,280
on that okay

478
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
finally we have a recent working group

479
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,039
document

480
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,320
this was recently adopted there was a

481
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,240
comment

482
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,760
to can this procedure be made more

483
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,960
generic whether we do this

484
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,960
in this id or via a future mechanism

485
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,799
that needs to be established so if you

486
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
have any thoughts please discuss on the

487
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,679
list

488
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,000
so i would expect authors to provide an

489
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,039
update on that as well and i see andrew

490
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,039
he said andrew go ahead

491
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
in your comment i hope it didn't

492
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,840
actually upload as that but the

493
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,760
document was labeled as local protection

494
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,840
enforcement

495
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,120
the original it originally was listed as

496
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,480
path protection and then we renamed it

497
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
to local protection

498
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,360
um so i'm not sure if it's just the

499
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,879
slide is not correct or if it actually

500
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,360
uploaded incorrectly

501
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
uh i need to check i'm not sure so

502
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,320
thanks for pointing it out

503
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
thanks

504
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,799
okay so final slide from the working

505
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,520
group uh status is what's our adoption

506
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,440
poll queue

507
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,879
so these two documents have been pending

508
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,200
in our adoption call

509
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,600
so we will be taking up uh taking up

510
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,480
these documents pcc sr document

511
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,158
and stateful interdomain document many

512
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,799
of you have made your request

513
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,320
those requests are tracked in the wiki

514
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,158
in the link that you see

515
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,678
so if something is missed if something

516
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,039
is incorrect please reach us

517
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,520
and we will update that this queue is

518
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,000
growing long so we need to start moving

519
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,559
it so to help us i would also request

520
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,919
that like

521
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:30,320
when we do the adoption poll please do

522
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,200
respond that helps us even moving your

523
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,039
documents

524
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,559
early on right so it's like you know

525
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,760
when we do that option call we are

526
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,080
looking for feedback

527
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,280
please provide feedback uh for all the

528
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,439
working group uh

529
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,559
documents in last call as well as

530
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,679
adoption

531
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,678
and that's it and

532
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,960
uh if there is no other comment we will

533
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,960
start with our agenda

534
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,240
okay mike you are next

535
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,480
uh hi everyone i'm michael kolduchev

536
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,039
i'll be

537
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,039
presenting this draft carrying binding

538
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,559
state label

539
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,120
uh segment id and pc based networks

540
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,360
on behalf of the authors next slide

541
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
please

542
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,280
so i think we all kind of know what the

543
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,159
binding

544
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,039
label or binding set is it's basically

545
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,159
attached to

546
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:35,360
a policy or a tunnel and

547
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,840
this draft defines this t-path binding

548
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,840
tlv

549
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,159
in this tlv there's something called

550
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,600
there's a numeric field called a binding

551
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,760
type

552
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,000
and this binding type basically um

553
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,080
it controls the value of the binding

554
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,960
value

555
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
so for binding type 0 and 1 the binding

556
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,600
value

557
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,719
is an mpls label for binding type 2 the

558
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
binding value

559
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,120
is a srv6 sid

560
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,000
for and so in this new iteration of the

561
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,479
draft we define

562
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,280
the binding type 3 which

563
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,840
causes the binding value to be an srv6

564
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,960
sid plus some extra information

565
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,439
for carrying endpoint behavior

566
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,400
and sid structure as we'll show in the

567
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,679
next slide

568
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:34,320
if you can go to the next slide

569
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,320
so as part of srv6 network programming

570
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,760
srv6 binding sids can have

571
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,480
endpoint behavior and

572
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,480
sid structure so

573
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,320
we simply add

574
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,000
these pieces of information

575
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,840
to the end of this binding value

576
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,919
after the actual srv6 binding sid

577
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,918
so there will be like an srv6 binding

578
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,559
sid 16 octets

579
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,559
and then this extra information

580
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
next slide please

581
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,200
and we also added kind of unrelated to

582
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,600
this

583
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:27,760
srv6 stuff we added

584
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:31,600
the s-flag and the i-flag so the s-flag

585
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,240
specifies that if

586
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,000
you cannot allocate the requested

587
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,600
binding sid for a particular

588
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,919
policy or a tunnel then

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:47,360
that policy or a tunnel has to be

590
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,320
invalid so it means like you must use

591
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,320
this binding sid

592
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,840
and the i flag

593
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
is

594
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,960
is like kind of invalidation drop

595
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,080
behavior so

596
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,240
it basically means that this pause

597
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:11,279
this tunnel or policy um

598
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,400
must kind of so sorry

599
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,360
what i mean is like bgp traffic that is

600
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,960
normally steered into this policy

601
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,479
uh it's it's always uh

602
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,400
you know steered into that policy even

603
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,000
if the policy doesn't have a path

604
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,200
so in that case the traffic would just

605
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,480
be dropped

606
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,880
next slide please and that's

607
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,360
that's it for the updates so we can

608
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,360
discuss

609
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,840
some questions or next steps

610
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
thanks

611
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,000
uh any comments from anyone yeah go

612
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,080
ahead tarek

613
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
mike this is tariq from juniper networks

614
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,120
um

615
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,840
thanks for the updates um i have a

616
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,600
question on the binding sid

617
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,039
a new type um currently you can download

618
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,120
one is that correct is my instruction uh

619
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
one binding set for one tunnel or one

620
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,239
yes uh so

621
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,678
yeah thanks for bringing this up so we

622
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
actually changed that as well

623
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,720
um that was another kind of update

624
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
was that uh we allow for multiple

625
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,760
binding sets

626
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,960
now because as well

627
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:29,039
or just srv6

628
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,480
we allow it for mpls as well

629
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,960
okay i like it okay

630
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,200
thanks why both go ahead

631
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,320
yeah this is fine more from future way i

632
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,720
have questions

633
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,678
so for the binding type you have zero

634
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,960
and one

635
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,159
for ampules label tunnel

636
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,640
so why do you use two values zero and

637
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,640
one

638
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,840
for one time uh sure yeah so

639
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,200
basically um zero

640
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,720
and one is to differentiate

641
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:09,120
uh the other fields in uh in the

642
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,559
um like in the mpls 32-bit label

643
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,479
um such as the exp bits

644
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,120
and um yeah i think it's just exp bits

645
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
so basically

646
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,760
i think like bt1 specif means that you

647
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,399
can

648
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,399
uh control the exp bits

649
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,480
in the in the mpls label and bt 0 means

650
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,199
that

651
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,039
you only want to specify the actual 20

652
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,159
bit mpls label

653
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,158
and you don't care about the exp bits

654
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,960
does that answer the is i question

655
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,520
maybe uh if you can get more details

656
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,720
in the is that is this details in your

657
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,559
document

658
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
yeah yeah it is it is there for sure

659
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,520
yeah okay

660
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,200
it's basically the difference between

661
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,399
you know putting a 20-bit

662
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,720
uh label versus putting a 32-bit uh

663
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,719
label

664
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
i would say 32-bit label stack entry

665
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,679
that would

666
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,399
you know the right way you're going to

667
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,399
say right

668
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,320
yeah i'm not seeing anybody else in the

669
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,199
queue

670
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,918
so thank you mike i think the document

671
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,320
is making

672
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
good progress uh we wanted to check with

673
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,960
you uh

674
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,360
uh since all the comments oh i spoke too

675
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,920
soon

676
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,399
boris is there boris go ahead

677
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,320
[Music]

678
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:38,320
thank you uh mike one question in recent

679
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,439
sr policy draft where

680
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,200
we added so-called composite path

681
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,559
do we need to reflect it here somehow or

682
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,720
not

683
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,760
it's not going to be in this draft it's

684
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,200
going to be

685
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,879
in in the decept multipath

686
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,399
draft so this is just for carrying the

687
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,240
binding label

688
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,879
and the binding label is really

689
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,480
unaffected by the whole composite

690
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:11,120
policy edition

691
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,360
so this draft will not

692
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,158
uh will not be affected by the composite

693
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,199
policy but

694
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,960
there is another draft called uh psap

695
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,000
multipath

696
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,840
for sr policy which is

697
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
going to be

698
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,440
hi mike i think even the sr policy

699
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
association

700
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,120
might be something that might change for

701
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,320
that as well right

702
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,520
not just the multi-path document uh

703
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,600
no i don't think so because it's

704
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,760
basically you

705
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,080
just need to carry the you know the

706
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,960
color instead of the ero

707
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,720
to to support this composite policy so

708
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,000
the candidate path will have instead of

709
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,120
having like a segment list

710
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,279
of labels it will just have a color

711
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,559
and that's all there is that's required

712
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,320
to support

713
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,279
you know signaling this can this

714
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,639
composite policy

715
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,399
uh go ahead

716
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,240
there might be some changes in this

717
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,239
policy as well so

718
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
if there are multiple ways of addressing

719
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,679
it you could have

720
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,559
two constituent sr policies having an

721
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,640
association

722
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,240
saying that they both belong to the same

723
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,720
parent policy so

724
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,399
we we will discuss that on the list and

725
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,159
address it but yeah you're right there

726
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,678
could be some changes in

727
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,679
sure yeah yeah

728
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,799
thanks pablo so coming back to the

729
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,918
status of this document

730
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,840
binding said so julian and i discussed

731
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,360
we think that the document is making

732
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,158
good progress we wanted to check with

733
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
the authors

734
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,279
what do they think about the status of

735
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,840
the document is it ready for

736
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
last call

737
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,039
that's the question to you mike

738
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
a little bit more um

739
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,918
we can we can wait until maybe the next

740
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,279
one to decide that

741
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:19,840
okay perfect thank you uh

742
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,840

go ahead oh yeah i agree with mike that

747
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,960
we can wait for one more uh meeting to

748
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,080
see that do you have any further

749
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,519
extensions on

750
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,120
finding seed right okay

751
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,919
thank you yeah so i think you can stay

752
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,840
on

753
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,840
for the next presentation as well

754
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,399
hello guys chung li from huawei my topic

755
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,679
today is about a pcp extension

756
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,840
for srv6 so uh

757
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
next please

758
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:23,440
so uh we make the uh presentation

759
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,480
uh last time in itf 105

760
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,240
so from that on to now we

761
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,679
have updated documents from revision 0

762
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,200
to revision like

763
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,640
7. so this slide talks about uh

764
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,760
the uh update of uh from 0 to

765
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,919
6. so basically we have defined

766
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,120
the foreign extension for some six in

767
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,320
psep

768
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,879
so we make we add a new p uh

769
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,480
part setup type in the passive type

770
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,120
capability tv

771
00:32:52,480 --> 00:33:00,880
which is the srv6 pause so also we have

772
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,918
added a new srv6 pcp a pc

773
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,880
pc capability sub trv to specify more

774
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,720
like

775
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,919
detailed information like um msd

776
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:15,039
information for uh srv6 pass

777
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,120
so uh we also introduced the new pst for

778
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,480
srv6 in rp and srp object to uh

779
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,518
specify the uh pass

780
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,679
computation requirement and reply right

781
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,080
so uh the most important part is that we

782
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,919
introduce a new

783
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,199
srv6er sub-object and we

784
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,120
uh we rename the field of

785
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,159
c type to an ai type

786
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,279
entity for short so uh also we update

787
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,080
the srv6

788
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,360
our subject you can see the format in

789
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,720
this slide

790
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:55,840
so next

791
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,039
so at last update uh which is

792
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,519
from zero six two zero seven we will

793
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,279
make a

794
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,080
a major update of the uh draft we add a

795
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,039
new sub theory called c structure t of

796
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,639
each aligned with

797
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,759
extensions in uh isis and bgpls

798
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,760
and uh phps policy.draft right

799
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,800
so as you can you can see here we we

800
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,480
make uh

801
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,119
we paste the updated uh

802
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,839
format encoding format of the srv6eo

803
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,960
subject

804
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,480
sub object which sits list here and as

805
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,159
you can see we also introduced

806
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,599
uh two more flags into this sub-object

807
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,359
the first one is t t means that uh

808
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,399
when p sets we will have an optional

809
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,078
a by c structure when the

810
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,199
srv6 is included so right uh we have to

811
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,079
uh

812
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,879
make sure that airspeed is uh unset

813
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,839
right now

814
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,879
uh when the t bit is set so also we

815
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,480
introduce the v

816
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,000
flag into this sub object for uh see the

817
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,200
verification

818
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,359
so and the use usage is uh

819
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,560
the same identica identical to the

820
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,319
section five

821
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,279
point one of uh uh srv6

822
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,079
of the uh segment routing policy also

823
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,359
one comment

824
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
uh here do we really need to add a flag

825
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,200
here

826
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,720
i see another document to specify to

827
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,839
uh carrying the uh algorithm

828
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,200
information in two more new like

829
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,960
nai i think that will be presented in

830
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,560
the following

831
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,280
topics so we can discuss this so

832
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,279
next please

833
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,078
so this slides uh describes the details

834
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,720
of the

835
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,000
uh cities structures sub-theory as you

836
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,919
can see here

837
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,960
we used eight bytes uh

838
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,240
tlv to describe the format of the

839
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,720
c structure instead of four the reason

840
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,560
is that uh we think the four bytes

841
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,879
see structure of it is too limited

842
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,400
because we can only describe only

843
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,200
like four parts of the sf60 for now but

844
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,680
what if we have more like parts or more

845
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,720
like

846
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,759
attributes of the srv6 structure

847
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,399
and we have no like further beats or

848
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,680
reserved

849
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,880
fields to to like describe that so we

850
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,560
introduced

851
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,240
like 32 bits reserved

852
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,680
fields for for the future usage

853
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:40,160
right so that is the

854
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:43,279
main thing so next

855
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,319
okay the plan of this draft is that uh

856
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,680
we are going to update the document

857
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,760
a few times and then when the document

858
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,240
is ready we will record

859
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,359
we will request for working group law

860
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,959
school but

861
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,400
i don't think right now is the right

862
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,640
timing so comments

863
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,640
are always welcome yeah that's all

864
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,839
any comments

865
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,960
so i think as cheng was mentioning we

866
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,839
have the next talk which will

867
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,680
uh have like which will describe about

868
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,078
algorithm so we can take up

869
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,359
this question about whether we need an

870
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,880
extra flag

871
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,799
or not one comment would be that between

872
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,160
the two documents the binding set

873
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,800
and the and the p srv6 where the sit

874
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,200
structure

875
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,200
is added if you can align the sit

876
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,680
structure between the two documents

877
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,560
that would be good like uh it should be

878
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,799
same format

879
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,119
uh in at least in the psep so that i

880
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,280
would request the both authors to

881
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,200
uh discuss and put a common set

882
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,480
structure format for both binding sid

883
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,399
and srv6

884
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,440
ero okay cool

885
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,640
uh another question this is not

886
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,599
directly related to uh

887
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,960
to srv6 but this v flag is something

888
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,200
that we don't have

889
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,960
for sr mpls also and this is a question

890
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,560
that we should evaluate that as you know

891
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,520
sr amperes we already have

892
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,000
a published rfc but we don't have this v

893
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,880
flag

894
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,400
and uh if we are adding it to srv6ero we

895
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,599
maybe we find a way

896
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,480
also to update uh

897
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,160
the sr mpls and add the v flag somewhere

898
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,200
one option is even the next document

899
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,839
that we are discussing

900
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,000
the algorithm one maybe in that document

901
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,720
if this v flag can be added as well

902
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,200
so just a question to the working group

903
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,560
regarding this as well

904
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,560
if anybody has any comments

905
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:01,839
okay moving right ahead

906
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,240
mike are you gonna be presenting

907
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,960
actually samuel was

908
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,560
gonna present but i think he's not here

909
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,200
so i can i can be a

910
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,400
backup presenter here perfect thank you

911
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,598
for doing that

912
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,839
sure so my name is mike koldishov from

913
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,720
cisco i'll be presenting this draft

914
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,839
carrying cid

915
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,720
algorithm information and pc based

916
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,720
networks next slide please

917
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,680
so uh the motivation is that

918
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,320
we kind of have two things we want to do

919
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,879
first we want to

920
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,200
signal a constraint to the pce to say

921
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,200
that

922
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:56,079
we want to compute a path using

923
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,400
a particular sid algorithm

924
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,640
the second thing we want to do is once

925
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,680
that path is actually computed

926
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,160
we want the pc to

927
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:11,520
send the ero and in the ero to specify

928
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,640
the sid algorithm of each

929
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,680
uh sid that it

930
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,680
put in the ero so

931
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,040
this draft basically allows you to do

932
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,839
those two things

933
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
next slide please

934
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,040
um yeah so basically there's like this

935
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,160
prefix it algorithm is

936
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,520
kind of a igp thing so it's

937
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,960
there's two default or two

938
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,079
kind of basic algorithms defined spf and

939
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,000
strict spf

940
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,480
they're zero and one and then there is

941
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,040
something called flex algorithm which is

942
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,240
uh

943
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,720
id 128 and greater

944
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,680
and flux algorithm allows you to have

945
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,720
like

946
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:07,839
any kind of constraints uh in

947
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:11,279
in there so next slide please

948
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,119
so the way we signal

949
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:19,040
the the sid algorithm used by

950
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:22,079
a given sid is we

951
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,119
define a new nai type for

952
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,200
that so nai is the node or adjacency

953
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,319
identifier

954
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,319
and basically we define this these two

955
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:37,359
new nai types for

956
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:41,119
ipv4 and ipv6 nodesid with algorithm

957
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:43,040
and so basically this nai carries

958
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,000
a little bit of extra information to

959
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,000
encode the algorithm

960
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,119
um and so yeah next slide thanks

961
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,520
and this is the the other part of the

962
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,920
of the requirement is that we want to

963
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,920
have a

964
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,400
computation constraint to say that

965
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:10,480
we want a particular path to be computed

966
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:14,839
using a particular algorithm

967
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,160
and so this tlv is put in the lspa

968
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,400
object

969
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,920
to basically specify that constraint

970
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,839
so for example if you want to compute

971
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,440
like a path using

972
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,560
you know flex algorithm 129 you can

973
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,560
attach this tlv

974
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,030
and there's like fallback flag and loose

975
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,279
flag to

976
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,880
[Music]

977
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,760
say if you you know if you

978
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,520
if you're allowed to use other other

979
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,760
algorithms

980
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,759
in the path next slide please

981
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,920
uh yeah so just comments and suggestions

982
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,839
and we would like to

983
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,839
request one group adoption for this one

984
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
thanks

985
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,839
sorry about that jay go ahead

986
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:39,040
hello yes go ahead okay this is jaydon

987
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,440
and i have read a document and i think

988
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,160
it provides the segment times which are

989
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,079
defined in the sr policy

990
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,520
that's i think this is a useful

991
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,240
extension

992
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,040
and some comments one is about the

993
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,078
albeit

994
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,680
i think in this this is not clear to me

995
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,880
whether different previous

996
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,598
with different algorithm can be put in

997
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,760
the same

998
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,760
like ero for one pass

999
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,480
is that allowed or not different uh

1000
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,759
algorithms

1001
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,680
in the same path if you

1002
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,160
cannot meet yeah i think i think if you

1003
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,359
specify this loose flag then

1004
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,640
it is allowed to insert another

1005
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,960
brief another algorithm like a prefix it

1006
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,078
with another algorithm

1007
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,640
yeah but can different prefixes with

1008
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,000
different

1009
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:37,520
algorithm be used in one

1010
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,480
like for one i suppose

1011
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,839
i think this may be something can cause

1012
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,119
a loop

1013
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,319
if it is allowed like you mean

1014
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,520
can i specify to use like prefix or

1015
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,720
sorry like uh

1016
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,160
algorithm 128 and 129

1017
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,078
or are you saying like to specify

1018
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,200
okay use algorithm 129 if you can but

1019
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,800
if you can't then fall back to

1020
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,118
some other algorithm yeah my point is uh

1021
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,599
for one for the previous series in one

1022
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,359
pass

1023
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,839
you maybe need to restrict them to use

1024
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,640
the

1025
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,040
a consistent algorithm if they fall back

1026
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,440
to

1027
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:21,520
one then they must they should not use

1028
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,319
different algorithm

1029
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,759
you you think that can cause them i can

1030
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,560
cause a loop

1031
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,880
yeah different oxygen used in one pass

1032
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,680
may call the loop

1033
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,480
yeah now this is my first comment

1034
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,839
another one is

1035
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,800
maybe a general comments about the psap

1036
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:42,400
sr because

1037
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,280
i see that uh the intercept sr segment

1038
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,359
types

1039
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,400
are described in a different way from

1040
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,319
the uh

1041
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,720
sr policy in bgp right i'm not

1042
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,759
so maybe better to check whether there's

1043
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,640
still some

1044
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,480
uh inconsistency between the two

1045
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,640
mechanisms in the

1046
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,079
meeting the segment types defined in the

1047
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,720
uh as a policy

1048
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,000
document in spring working group yeah

1049
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,040
they are quite different

1050
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,079
uh we use in psap we use this like

1051
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,440
nai encoding yes

1052
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:19,280
uh and in bgp um

1053
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,720
te they use different types of sids like

1054
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,920
abcd

1055
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,520
up to yeah or something and yeah they

1056
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,720
are quite different and it's probably

1057
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,079
too late to

1058
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,759
try to unify them i need to align yeah

1059
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,839
it's probably too late uh to be honest

1060
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,480
because a lot of yeah

1061
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,319
yeah the format can be different i mean

1062
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,119
for the different segment types you to

1063
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,160
make sure that

1064
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,440
each one has been defined for both as a

1065
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,560
bgp as a policy and the psap sr

1066
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,400
extensions yeah yeah i think we we

1067
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,839
definitely should go through them and

1068
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,880
make sure that

1069
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:59,040
they they have equivalents

1070
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:02,079
in either encode in either format

1071
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,759
yeah yeah yeah okay

1072
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,520
just to add to what jay was saying i

1073
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,359
think since we have found one issue with

1074
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,280
the algorithm and we are fixing it

1075
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,640
we can use this opportunity to find

1076
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,680
anything else that

1077
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,680
is misaligned and in one document itself

1078
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,839
try to update for example even the v

1079
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,000
flat thing that we were discussing

1080
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,640
in the previous document can we use

1081
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,119
maybe this document to also

1082
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,200
add the v flag for srm pls just an

1083
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,760
example

1084
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,759
sure yeah

1085
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,480
uh there is uh before i go on with the

1086
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,000
queue just since we are on the same page

1087
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,400
i think this lspa part is not very clear

1088
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,160
because we are not sure whether this

1089
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,960
algorithm is to be used

1090
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,839
as end-to-end path algorithm or is it

1091
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,079
just

1092
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,960
while while you are picking a particular

1093
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,000
sits

1094
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,559
you prefer algorithms you prefer prefix

1095
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,319
it which uses this algorithm that part

1096
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,359
is missing even from the presentation

1097
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,558
and the document

1098
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:04,000
not very clear as you know we have an of

1099
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,720
which is an optimization objective

1100
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,319
function

1101
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,078
which is supposed to do like you know

1102
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,000
minimum delay path which is an

1103
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,079
end-to-end objective function

1104
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,040
is this algorithm going to replace that

1105
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,680
or is it just

1106
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,880
adding to that so please do take care of

1107
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,078
that part as well when you are

1108
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,200
describing lsba

1109
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,040
okay point taken thanks uh tariq go

1110
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,160
ahead

1111
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,480
i'll talk with juniper um maybe you were

1112
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,319
uh

1113
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,680
faster than me to ask the question so

1114
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:36,720
but i'll reiterate it in a different way

1115
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:38,879
so if you're crossing multiple domains

1116
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,279
you might want to stay in domain one i

1117
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,079
want algorithm 128 and the domain two i

1118
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,760
want

1119
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,079
algorithm 129 and in the third domain

1120
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,119
you want a different algorithm

1121
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,640
there is an implicit function here that

1122
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,599
the algorithm

1123
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,598
is end to end

1124
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,520
but indeed every domain can define

1125
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,359
you know let's take an example the low

1126
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,480
latency flex algo

1127
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:08,319
to be 128 in the domain one

1128
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,839
and it can be anything else in domain

1129
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,520
two and domain three

1130
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:17,040
uh so you might wanna uh

1131
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:20,480
open up the possibility to have multiple

1132
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,279
uh or an algorithm per domain yeah and i

1133
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,760
don't know how

1134
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,880
i i you know we can we can talk uh how

1135
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,400
the details of it

1136
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,040
uh um you know how to specify in the

1137
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,240
domain

1138
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,599
the algorithm um but i don't see it

1139
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,680
end to end it's hard yeah

1140
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,920
yeah i'm not sure how how you would

1141
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,279
encode how you would specify

1142
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,280
like per domain algorithm yeah um

1143
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,558
yeah i'll think that i'll i'll reach out

1144
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,160
offline no problem

1145
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,520
yeah thanks laura

1146
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:02,000
go ahead yeah can you hear me yes yeah

1147
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:05,520
okay uh i have a question on the

1148
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,119
number of things you can do from

1149
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,000
one algorithm i read the draft i thought

1150
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,839
i understood

1151
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,119
but when you presented you gave an

1152
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:15,920
example where you can do

1153
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,200
two different things uh in the same

1154
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,319
algorithm

1155
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,839
is there a practical

1156
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:26,960
limit to how many things you can do

1157
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,839
um not 100 sure what you mean by two

1158
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,920
different things

1159
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,960
uh what i was saying is that you want to

1160
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,760
specif you need to be able to specify

1161
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,599
a flex algo computation constraint

1162
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,200
that's one thing and you need to be able

1163
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,280
to

1164
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:47,919
specify that a given computed

1165
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,480
ero hop is of a particular flux

1166
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
algorithm

1167
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,559
those say that the only two things we

1168
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,079
can do

1169
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:03,280
well i i guess

1170
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,680
yeah that's so let's

1171
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,599
let's imagine that we figure out

1172
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,799
something else you want to put in there

1173
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,280
is it possible uh with the current

1174
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,280
format

1175
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,720
um i'm not sure exactly what you mean by

1176
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,480
like

1177
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,839
something else maybe if you can give

1178
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,280
just like a very

1179
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:26,160
hypothetical example

1180
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,160
yeah i'm not

1181
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,559
i mean this is kind of for for a very

1182
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,598
specific purpose right to

1183
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:38,160
carry you know flux algorithm

1184
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:41,200
either constraint or result

1185
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:44,160
so let's say you you have more than one

1186
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,160
type of constraint

1187
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:53,520
you have a minimum bandwidth

1188
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:57,200
and the jitter

1189
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,200
can you put both of them in there

1190
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,480
you may be able to mix like a flex algo

1191
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,680
constraint

1192
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,800
with another constraint like for example

1193
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,799
you may be able to say

1194
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:17,598
use flux algo128 which is like a latency

1195
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:21,759
flex algo and

1196
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,720
also try to exclude some affinity maybe

1197
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,000
i don't know

1198
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:31,520
and so it may be possible to combine

1199
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,520
you know different constraints like that

1200
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,880
yeah the constraint basically says that

1201
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,000
the way the the way the draft is worded

1202
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,640
the constraint says that um the

1203
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,240
head end says you know i want my path to

1204
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:56,000
be computed using

1205
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:56,000
a particular flex algo say for example

1206
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:07,839
for example um

1207
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,839
could you do things like excluding nodes

1208
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,920
yeah you should be able to yeah you

1209
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,480
should be able to encode that

1210
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,079
but then then we have more than two and

1211
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,520
don't we

1212
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,440
yeah you can have more than two

1213
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:22,160
constraints for sure this is just

1214
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,960
one constraint yeah that's what i want

1215
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,160
to hear

1216
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,640
so there is no practical limit uh

1217
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,240
to how many constraints you have yeah

1218
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,960
yeah for sure not this this is just

1219
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,558
adding one extra constraint right to the

1220
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,640
pset protocol

1221
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,400
it doesn't mean that all the other

1222
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,440
constraints are not allowed to be

1223
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,480
used with this with this one

1224
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,359
they can still be used yeah okay thank

1225
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,839
you

1226
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,839
yeah and slower whoa you are next

1227
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:56,800
yes so regarding to

1228
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:59,680
you allow each specific state have a

1229
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,960
different algorithm that means in one

1230
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,480
domain

1231
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,520
for for that path we can have multiple

1232
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:10,000
different algorithms right one maybe for

1233
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:13,119
delay one maybe for

1234
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,680
uh bandwidth so this looks like you have

1235
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,760
a

1236
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,960
consistency at least in one domain right

1237
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:23,920
well not necessarily like for example

1238
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,160
if you're if you're optimized like say

1239
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,160
you

1240
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,160
you request a path just optimizing

1241
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,680
latency right

1242
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,680
and you have a flex algo

1243
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,440
a certain flex algo that optimizes

1244
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,200
latency

1245
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,799
even though you didn't request that flex

1246
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:40,799
algo

1247
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:43,359
because it fits with your constraint the

1248
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:46,640
pc may return you a path

1249
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,640
using that flex algo

1250
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,920
so so is that a node for example in one

1251
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,200
domain and then we have a multiple uh

1252
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,599
prefix sheet and then

1253
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,598
for multiple for each of them maybe we

1254
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,119
can use different algorithm

1255
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,440
yeah that's that's we should have a

1256
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,799
consistency right some kind of

1257
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,040
maybe this algorithm is in one group

1258
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,040
in one domain so different algorithm but

1259
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,839
this is not this different algorithm

1260
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,880
is from one group so that makes sense

1261
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,359
with the most

1262
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,760
at least at to some extent those

1263
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,040
algorithm is a

1264
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,599
consistency to some extent i don't think

1265
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:27,359
there's any problem with using

1266
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:29,920
you know different algorithms

1267
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:33,119
either within a domain or outside of a

1268
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,640
domain like you may have a

1269
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,200
zero algorithm sid followed by uh

1270
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,040
128 algorithms sid you know followed by

1271
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,118
129 algorithms

1272
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,119
if it helps you reduce the the label

1273
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,319
stack size

1274
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,799
and you know make use of equal cost

1275
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:54,640
multipath

1276
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,640
i don't think it causes any problems

1277
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:00,839
there may be some i'm not sure you

1278
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,040
brought up the point of

1279
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:04,319
loops

1280
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,640
you know if you can come up with a

1281
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:09,279
particular example where a loop can

1282
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,200
happen if you you know change different

1283
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,680
algorithms like that

1284
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:16,960
but it would be up to the the the pce

1285
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,279
controller to compute a path properly

1286
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:21,599
uh you know to to take care of that it

1287
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,920
doesn't cause loops

1288
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,599
yes maybe it's too loose or too flexible

1289
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
and at least that we should have some

1290
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,040
check

1291
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,520
whether there's a so with different

1292
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,599
prefix with different algorithm and this

1293
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,960
will have some kind of a

1294
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:38,480
check whether these are

1295
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,040
these different algorithms at different

1296
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,359
points there may be some kind of a

1297
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,119
consistency to some extent we can always

1298
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:48,319
just use different algorithm for

1299
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:50,640
at least for this privacy and then next

1300
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:51,839
is another other maybe totally different

1301
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,000
one

1302
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:58,160
well why not i mean we can discuss that

1303
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,200
i don't believe there's any reason why

1304
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:02,160
you can't

1305
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,000
why you can't use that yeah i think this

1306
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,160
is best for the mailing list now

1307
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,920
so yeah we have let's take up with the

1308
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,240
next present uh next

1309
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,960
person in the queue so parven go ahead

1310
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,399
juniper networks um i there is

1311
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,440
definitely value in

1312
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,359
having the ability to specify

1313
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,480
say different set of constraints or

1314
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,759
different

1315
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,480
optimization objectives uh for a given

1316
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,920
domain

1317
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:32,799
for an inter domain path right so um

1318
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,760
so the in in rsvp at least we have this

1319
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:38,240
notion of

1320
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:40,240
uh hop attributes where you can

1321
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,680
provide a set of attributes associated

1322
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,078
with the given hop

1323
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,440
so in the intentions we today in piece

1324
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,400
of the problems we don't have that

1325
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,559
notion of

1326
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,640
a hop specific or a domain specific

1327
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,440
attributes in our inclusions

1328
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,040
so if we can bring in that construct

1329
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,880
into psap i think you'll be able to

1330
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,000
address your requirement where you

1331
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,839
say uh while traversing for this term

1332
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,680
computation in this domain use this set

1333
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,558
of constraints for the next

1334
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,598
domain you specify the next domain id as

1335
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,359
your inclusion and then

1336
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,960
give the hop attributes associated with

1337
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:13,119
that we

1338
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,480
can we can talk about it on the list but

1339
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,680
yeah there are ways to

1340
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,839
address this yeah maybe we can somehow

1341
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:23,040
have like a uh a way in peace up to say

1342
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,119
that uh

1343
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,960
you know to give like an identifier for

1344
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,079
a domain

1345
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:33,680
uh and say like within this domain like

1346
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,079
some construction yeah that exists today

1347
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,078
like

1348
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,520
drew is trying to say but we don't have

1349
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,520
a way to specify

1350
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,359
attributes associated with that domain

1351
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,359
or our constraints or

1352
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:45,359
optimization objectives associated with

1353
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:46,480
that and that's probably the missing

1354
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,040
piece and there

1355
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,520
there is a there's an object available

1356
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,520
in

1357
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,040
rscp that can be borrowed to address

1358
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,559
this

1359
00:58:53,040 --> 00:59:00,240
okay that's cool yeah jeff go ahead

1360
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:03,200
uh quickly please so i would say

1361
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,160
concatenation of algus would be okay

1362
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,558
it's a logical

1363
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,000
end for example you want to optimize

1364
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,200
towards slow latency

1365
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,640
and your jointness logical or however

1366
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,879
is not especially with a single domain

1367
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,000
intermixing not from different algos

1368
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:21,520
it's not a good idea

1369
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,400
but there's idea of continuous

1370
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,040
connectivity within an algo right so i i

1371
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,119
would be really against using this way

1372
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:33,440
it's more on guts feeling than

1373
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,880
scientific right now but

1374
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,040
like i'm sure there there could be

1375
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,839
counter examples to

1376
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:45,920
you know to cases where it's bad um

1377
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:47,119
but yeah i mean there could also be you

1378
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,599
know

1379
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,400
examples where it's useful uh so i don't

1380
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,520
know

1381
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,440
i'm not either for or against it

1382
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:57,520
but the encoding is there so like if

1383
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,839
you're you know if your pc server wants

1384
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:01,839
to encode it

1385
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,920
perspective i think we need to provide

1386
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:10,720
tips specifying scenarios where

1387
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,720
it's safe to do so and

1388
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,520
yeah so you know if something can go

1389
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,079
wrong it will go wrong

1390
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:19,200
so we need to protect uh consumers

1391
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,559
information

1392
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,480
from from breaking things

1393
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,319
yeah that's more kind of a vendor

1394
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,799
implementation of the algorithm right

1395
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,200
like

1396
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:30,720
you know your each vendor has to you

1397
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,879
know make sure that their

1398
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:38,480
computation algorithm results in a safe

1399
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:42,240
uh segment list right

1400
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,319
and you know if if your pc computes a

1401
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,799
segment list that

1402
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,520
can result in like loops or something

1403
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,520
like this or

1404
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:56,558
then it's kind of

1405
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:59,760
you know the the implementations problem

1406
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,280
in my opinion no it's not our job as

1407
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,319
people who develop standards is to

1408
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,599
remove ambiguity

1409
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,440
and please do provide clear text as

1410
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,359
how to do it and if you cannot probably

1411
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,359
should remove it

1412
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,640
yeah let's uh let's take this now to the

1413
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:17,520
list i think thank you

1414
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,720
jeff for excellent suggestion uh we are

1415
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,079
taking up time from the next

1416
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,160
presentation so shangji

1417
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,000
if uh you can take your question to the

1418
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,598
list and there's a lot of good

1419
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,359
discussion already on this document so

1420
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,799
thank you for that let's move on to the

1421
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:31,119
next presentation

1422
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,119
thank you

1423
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,559
are you here yeah go ahead yes i uh just

1424
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,079
doing a voice check can you guys hear me

1425
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:45,680
yes perfect thank you so uh my name is

1426
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,680
human bitgoli from nokia

1427
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,879
i'm presenting the pce as our point to

1428
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,319
multiplane policy

1429
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,400
next slide please so

1430
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,920
with regard to this presentation i'm

1431
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,160
just going over the

1432
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,920
high level view of what the point to

1433
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,440
multiplying policy is

1434
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,599
i'm not going to go into the nuts and

1435
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,280
bolts uh you can read the draft i just

1436
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,160
want to make sure everybody understands

1437
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,400
what the idea

1438
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,160
is and when we are where we are trying

1439
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,799
to go with this idea

1440
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,720
now there were multiple drafts uh

1441
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,960
including one in a spring

1442
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,759
which was the replication segment and

1443
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,839
one in pin

1444
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:21,039
which was the sr point to multi-point

1445
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:24,720
policy

1446
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:26,400
uh around five six itf ago i did present

1447
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,680
this graph in the pce

1448
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:31,520
but back then these replication segment

1449
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,520
and the point-to-multiplying policy

1450
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,079
drafts were not adopted

1451
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:38,240
as such we put this draft on hold for

1452
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,160
adaptation on the pce

1453
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,919
working group until these two other

1454
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,240
drafts are were adopted

1455
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,880
so as of now they are adopted there is a

1456
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:51,200
third draft that is the draft

1457
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,280
perk mvpn evpn sr point to multipoint

1458
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,720
we were asking for adaptation for that

1459
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,839
too in bess

1460
01:02:54,720 --> 01:03:00,480
and i believe as of yesterday

1461
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:02,799
that draft got a good support and it was

1462
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,799
adopted as well as you can see there are

1463
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:07,839
other drafts to make this solution

1464
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:09,839
uh complete which you can have a look at

1465
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:13,599
if if you you would like to learn more

1466
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:17,119
about it next slide please

1467
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:20,160
so why this idea was put on the table

1468
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,760
the basic idea is on the unicast side

1469
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,720
obviously we are moving away

1470
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,319
from the uh from the complex protocols

1471
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,879
like ldp rsvpte and we are trying to

1472
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,920
simplify the network with the underlay

1473
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,079
igp

1474
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,799
and then overlay pgp that creates an

1475
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,319
issue for multicast obviously when a

1476
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:43,280
vendor takes away these

1477
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:44,000
mpls protocols for unicast they don't

1478
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,880
want to let

1479
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,839
them langer in their networks for

1480
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,880
multicast multicast being the

1481
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:54,119
more complicated beast of the two

1482
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,640
obviously they want to do the

1483
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:57,440
simplifications on the multicast domain

1484
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,879
as well

1485
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:04,400
so this is how this idea was

1486
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,839
evolved by coming up with the very

1487
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,599
simple method

1488
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:12,078
to program a point to multipoint tree

1489
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,160
through a network whether that network

1490
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,880
is segment routing network

1491
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,720
or even if segment routing is not there

1492
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,760
we could program this point to multiple

1493
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,759
point three

1494
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,319
throughout the network to connect a

1495
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:27,839
route with the set of leaves

1496
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,839
next slide please

1497
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:33,839
so the very first concept of this

1498
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,799
uh idea is what we call the point to

1499
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:36,558
multi-point

1500
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,559
policy actually it's on the segment it's

1501
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:39,280
a policy my apologies i need to correct

1502
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,839
that

1503
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,119
so what is a policy you can think of a

1504
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,078
policy

1505
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:47,280
as a root and a set of leaves and it's

1506
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,319
really identified

1507
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:53,280
by the root id and the tree id

1508
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:54,000
now the root id and tree id is the

1509
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,880
basics

1510
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
identification of any multicast tree

1511
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,799
within the network

1512
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,440
even if you think about mldp or point to

1513
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:06,880
multiple rsvpt that's how we identify

1514
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,920
a tree within the network

1515
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,480
so under the point-to-multipoint policy

1516
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,000
you could have multiple candidate paths

1517
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,039
think of candidate paths

1518
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,319
as a redundancy for your point to

1519
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,039
multipoint three

1520
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:22,319
so you can have a primary candidate pad

1521
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,839
that is active

1522
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,720
and you can have multiple other

1523
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:29,279
candidate paths that are inactive

1524
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,319
and there is the preference and the one

1525
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,119
with the highest

1526
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:35,038
preference is the active one under the

1527
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,760
candidate path there are two path

1528
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,240
instances you can think of the patterns

1529
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,359
as the

1530
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:44,160
actual point-to-multipoint lsp

1531
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:45,759
or the forwarding entity the reason that

1532
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,038
there are path instances

1533
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,720
is basically for optimization

1534
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,799
of the candidate pad so if there is a

1535
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:54,799
break in the network

1536
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,480
and the candidate pad needs to do a

1537
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:59,680
global optimization

1538
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,760
it creates a second path instance the

1539
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:04,879
the pce programs the second path

1540
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,440
instance through the optimize the

1541
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,200
route from the root to the leaf and it

1542
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,760
doesn't make before break on the head

1543
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,879
end

1544
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,200
to switch from the previous unoptimized

1545
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,240
tree to the new optimized tree

1546
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:18,078
throughout the

1547
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,759
throughout the network there are

1548
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,520
multiple ways that you can configure

1549
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,640
this point to multiplying policy

1550
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,520
you can do pcc initiated what that means

1551
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,480
is that the

1552
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:32,319
mpbgp procedures that are in rfc 6514

1553
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:34,720
6513 you can look at the route types you

1554
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,720
can figure out where are the leafs

1555
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,839
what leafs want to join the point to

1556
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,359
multiply three

1557
01:06:37,839 --> 01:06:42,558
and based on that you can update the pce

1558
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:45,520
from the pcc

1559
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,880
with all this information tree id root

1560
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,839
id and on delete

1561
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,319
and the leafs or you can do pc initiated

1562
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,359
what the

1563
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:56,319
pc initiated is you go on the pce

1564
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:57,520
itself and you create your blue route

1565
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:59,599
and the set of leaves

1566
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,599
and you assign your tree id and then the

1567
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:05,760
pce downloads the information

1568
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,760
to the pcc next slide please

1569
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:10,640
so that was the policy that was that

1570
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:14,000
what identified

1571
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,319
the tree on the head and on the root now

1572
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
obviously we need to forward the packet

1573
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:19,680
the multicast pdu

1574
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,599
from the root to the leaf and that's

1575
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:24,480
where the replication segment comes in

1576
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,440
so the replication segment really has

1577
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,400
the label

1578
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,400
information the forwarding information

1579
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,680
the protection information

1580
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,400
etc etc now one thing we need to keep in

1581
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,680
mind

1582
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:42,720
is a replication segment is really

1583
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:46,960
a idea of

1584
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,959
multicasting a packet at a specific node

1585
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,200
two replication segment really can be

1586
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,240
connected via a unicast

1587
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,279
segment routing domain as well so

1588
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,598
the entire idea is not let's

1589
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,319
put replication segment one after

1590
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,880
another

1591
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:04,160
to forward these pdus through the

1592
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,720
replication segments

1593
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:08,319
but it's very flexible that you can have

1594
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:12,480
replication segments

1595
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:14,640
in a specific places in your network

1596
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:17,120
where you want to do the replication and

1597
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,479
you can connect these two replication

1598
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,479
via a unicast sr so it really plays very

1599
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:26,158
nicely with the unicast sr

1600
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:28,318
where there needs a need for the unicast

1601
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,358
unicasting between the two replication

1602
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,799
segments

1603
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,960
there are two type of replication

1604
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:34,158
segments and i want to be very clear

1605
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:37,120
about this one

1606
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,000
when it comes to point to multipoint

1607
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,679
lsps

1608
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,198
or mvpns a tunnel

1609
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:49,040
a point to multiple lsp represents

1610
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:52,479
the verb itself when you look at unicast

1611
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,439
you have the upstream assigned bgp label

1612
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,919
that actually identifies that verb when

1613
01:08:55,439 --> 01:08:59,678
you go

1614
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:03,440
into multicast domain the tunnel itself

1615
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:06,000
can actually bind the root vrf to the

1616
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,278
leaves verbs so that's one of the

1617
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,679
biggest difference

1618
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,759
between unicast and multicast so this is

1619
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:15,759
why we have a replication segment

1620
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:18,479
that can be identified with root tree id

1621
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,600
and the lsp id which will identify the

1622
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,799
vrf

1623
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:24,560
but there can be also an aggregation

1624
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:27,120
replication segment

1625
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,880
that will actually connect the root to

1626
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:32,640
the bunch of leaves

1627
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,759
but the verb can be actually identified

1628
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,719
by upstream assign label now

1629
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,238
this mode of behavior is is implemented

1630
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:43,279
by some vendors

1631
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,639
but as i said as of now the most common

1632
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,400
way of doing this

1633
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,040
is connecting the point to multi-point

1634
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,479
lsp into the verve so that's one thing

1635
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,719
that we need to keep in mind

1636
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,759
implementing this draft next slide

1637
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,239
please

1638
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,040
uh human uh you have a bunch of slides

1639
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,360
uh

1640
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,640
still and like you know we have around

1641
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,839
two three minutes

1642
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,080
of your slot left a little bit yeah i'm

1643
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,640
not just not going to go

1644
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,000
on thank you very much so can we go to

1645
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,000
the next slide in that case please

1646
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:16,080
so just to give you a little bit of a

1647
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,120
heads up what what how this works

1648
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:22,880
in the pcc initiate example

1649
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:24,719
as i said mpbgp will discover the leaves

1650
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,800
the root will discover the leaves the

1651
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,920
root will send the update message to the

1652
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,560
pce

1653
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,280
pce based on the bgpls states that it

1654
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,040
has

1655
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:36,559
builds the tree from the root to the

1656
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:39,040
leaves and it actually uses the

1657
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,640
the psep protocol to download this

1658
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,320
replication segment and the point of

1659
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,960
multi-point policies

1660
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,360
all the way down to the pce and builds

1661
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:52,719
the tree and actually binds that tree

1662
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,719
to a specific verb next slide please

1663
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,559
so this is just a very high diagram of

1664
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,040
all the informations that are there oh

1665
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,199
no want to slide back

1666
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,640
sorry my apologies yeah so this is again

1667
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,120
i explained the point to multiplying

1668
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,600
plot

1669
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,440
policy i explained the candidate path

1670
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,199
why the path instances are there

1671
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,199
and i explain what the replication

1672
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,559
segments are there and the fact that two

1673
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:18,320
replication segments

1674
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:20,320
can be connected via a unicast sr policy

1675
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,480
now for the rest of the slides those are

1676
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,040
just some examples that you guys can go

1677
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,639
through

1678
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,239
and actually you can have a look at them

1679
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,920
and try to understand better

1680
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,360
some of the concepts that we are trying

1681
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,159
to bring into this

1682
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,679
draft but basically the main point that

1683
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,679
we are trying to put on the table here

1684
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,920
is that there are multiple vendors

1685
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,000
working on this draft there are some

1686
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,760
implementations already out there

1687
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,440
some of the vendors are in the midst of

1688
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,600
implementing this draft

1689
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,559
and we wanted to make sure that you know

1690
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,120
the group is

1691
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:55,840
aware of that and if you go to the last

1692
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,840
slide please

1693
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,760
right so we are open to any comments and

1694
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:04,000
what we are hoping to do is actually

1695
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,920
adopt this draft for more comments

1696
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,800
obviously coming up on the next its

1697
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,800
whoever go ahead

1698
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,199
my answer is that this looks like a pc

1699
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:21,199
controller

1700
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:24,239
so for what

1701
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:27,519
srp srp20p policy or whatever pass

1702
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:30,400
so pc needed to send instructions to

1703
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,480
each of the mode along the pwmp path

1704
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:37,120
right

1705
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:39,599
so as i said the pce needs to send the

1706
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,199
information to the paths that are trying

1707
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,040
to do the replication because two

1708
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,360
replication segments

1709
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,400
can be connected via a unique ssr but

1710
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,360
you are correct

1711
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:50,400
the the nodes that are trying to do the

1712
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,719
replication

1713
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,159
needs to have this information correct

1714
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,120
so in that case

1715
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,839
so for each pitomp pass we have states

1716
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:00,559
in the network

1717
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,000
right so this seems a lot of consistency

1718
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:05,840
with

1719
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,840
the philosophy of sr

1720
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,280
routing or whatever segment routing

1721
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,520
right for sigma routine

1722
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,120
the idea is that we don't have any

1723
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,640
states in the network

1724
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:18,400
so for this case we can see that we

1725
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,320
we send the instructions to each other

1726
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,879
node along the p2p path and then those

1727
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,480
states

1728
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,360
stay in the network right right so

1729
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,400
good point that that battle was already

1730
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,440
fought in the

1731
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:34,320
spring working group and uh you know

1732
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,120
the the draft was adopted on the spring

1733
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,000
side but

1734
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,199
to answer your question basically a

1735
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,239
segment

1736
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,759
on a point-to-multiplying segment on

1737
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:47,280
each one of nodes

1738
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,199
creates a replication segment so

1739
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,480
without the replication segment you

1740
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,599
don't know what are your outgoing

1741
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,120
interfaces

1742
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,360
so you're going to go in this case

1743
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:58,480
you're going to go from a

1744
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:01,839
to c which is the next segment in in the

1745
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:01,839
replication point

1746
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,919
uh just to add on to what uh huaymou was

1747
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,239
saying i think

1748
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,080
uh like you know of course that battle

1749
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:10,718
uh i think we can move on for that

1750
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:14,000
question

1751
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:17,520
but i think with respect to pc extension

1752
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,360
we have a concept called pcc which is pc

1753
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,719
as a central controller and that was

1754
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,519
developed uh

1755
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,880
specially for cases where pc needs to

1756
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,520
send instruction

1757
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,960
on nodes which are not the head node so

1758
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,159
especially in your case

1759
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,480
when you have to send instruction to the

1760
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,639
the branch node or to the leaf node i

1761
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,280
think the pcc technique

1762
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,719
and use of cci object would have become

1763
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,120
a better extension

1764
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,239
to pc protocol than what is currently

1765
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,320
being described

1766
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,400
in the document and if you remember we

1767
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,519
we discussed this in the past as well

1768
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:54,839
when you last presented this in the pc

1769
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:57,840
working group and that concern still

1770
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,840
exists

1771
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:06,879
so we went down the path of the

1772
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:09,920
cc object and at the end of the day we

1773
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:12,640
felt that the the ero object the way

1774
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,760
that we are using it

1775
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:19,040
was a fit for this

1776
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,280
idea so you're absolutely right as of

1777
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,480
now we are using the ero object to

1778
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:26,000
download the

1779
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:29,120
forwarding information um but yeah

1780
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,520
like as as a group as as a team that's

1781
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,360
the path that we went down

1782
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,960
yeah i think like we let's have that

1783
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,120
discussion on the list

1784
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,000
it's not just the matter of uh ero

1785
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,159
object it's actually

1786
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,760
the whole framework that we came up with

1787
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,719
the whole framework of

1788
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,280
when pce is interacting with non-head

1789
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:47,120
nodes

1790
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,639
these are the like the framework and the

1791
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,760
architecture and various things in the

1792
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,760
pc protocol

1793
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,199
that you should take care of so i think

1794
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,040
those are still valid

1795
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,599
it's not just the matter of whether we

1796
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:59,199
use ero object or cci object

1797
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,280
it's the framework that i'm more worried

1798
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:04,000
about

1799
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:05,440
sure we can discuss that for sure in the

1800
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,080
okay i think we have taken

1801
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,960
our buffer time for the meeting has been

1802
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,199
taken so

1803
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,480
let's move to the next document thank

1804
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,879
you for presenting

1805
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,879
thank you

1806
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,840
shipping go ahead

1807
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:33,040
uh can you hear me okay

1808
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,519
hi this is shooking from huawei and i'm

1809
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,040
going to

1810
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:39,760
introduce the set of pcc drops

1811
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,760
next please

1812
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:50,239
so first a quick recap so we we have the

1813
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:53,440
rfc8283

1814
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,718
that defines the pce as a central

1815
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:58,320
controller

1816
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:01,840
and it also it also

1817
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,559
examines um the psap as the ice sdn

1818
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,239
source pump

1819
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,480
interface and for this draft the psap

1820
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:11,678
extension for the pcecc

1821
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:14,718
it specifies the basic psap extensions

1822
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,360
for the static rsv so

1823
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,640
as the chair has already introduced

1824
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,920
currently exposed

1825
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:25,360
working group last call and it

1826
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:28,800
has been reworked after the shepherd's

1827
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:32,400
review here we would like to thank

1828
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:36,500
to julian for the excellent comments

1829
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:37,679
to us and also today in today's

1830
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:41,120
[Music]

1831
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:45,760
to this morning we also replied

1832
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:49,519
to this further review and we will give

1833
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:52,800
another update on this draft

1834
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:55,679
to further resolve the the comments and

1835
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,880
very briefly about the recent changes so

1836
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,640
we reordered

1837
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:03,199
the sections with the pce initiated

1838
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,719
the script first which is also aligned

1839
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:07,599
with the common case

1840
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,560
in the case of pcc and we also have

1841
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,320
defined a

1842
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,880
an explicit flag that's a io flag in the

1843
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:16,239
pc

1844
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,560
cc capability sub prv the next

1845
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:18,559
please

1846
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,280
so basically for the further pcc

1847
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,239
extensions

1848
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,880
there are two parts one is the segment

1849
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:30,239
routine

1850
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:33,520
including both sr and prs and srv6

1851
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:36,879
and also p2mp so those are last

1852
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,960
discussed during the ietf 106.

1853
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,080
and they have been added in the working

1854
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,199
group adoption

1855
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:45,360
queue next please

1856
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:46,879
so in the following slides i will

1857
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,599
introduce each of them

1858
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,199
separately now first it's about the

1859
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:56,960
pcecc for the isr ampers

1860
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:59,599
so this dropped and uses the psap to

1861
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,440
allocate the srmprs label on all the

1862
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:05,120
nodes in the sr domain

1863
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:08,480
and we defined a new cci object tag

1864
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:11,760
for isr appearance and as well as a new

1865
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:13,040
effect object and here are some recent

1866
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,000
changes

1867
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:17,199
and we also align and sync with the

1868
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,400
other drafts

1869
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:23,440
and we reuse the pst equals to one for

1870
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:27,920
sr and we have also added

1871
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:31,678
new flags for the adjacency seed

1872
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:35,040
and we also did some editorial cleanup

1873
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:37,280
and it has been on the

1874
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,239
working group adoption queue for quite

1875
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:41,920
well and

1876
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,239
it has been overtaken and continuously

1877
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,360
by

1878
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:49,040
other drafts so now we would like to

1879
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:51,839
request to issue the adoption call

1880
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,840
next please

1881
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:58,840
about the pcc for srv6

1882
01:19:55,120 --> 01:20:00,000
and this draft uses psap to allocate

1883
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,199
srv6c

1884
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
on all the nodes in the sr domain and we

1885
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:09,519
defined a new cci object type

1886
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:11,760
for srv6 and for the recent changes

1887
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,560
we also aligned and synced with other

1888
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,760
drafts

1889
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:19,120
and we reused the pst equals to

1890
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:23,199
2bd and for srv6

1891
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:27,120
and we also added the new flags for the

1892
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:28,080
sessions adjacency seed and we also did

1893
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,120
some

1894
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:34,159
clear up and currently there is

1895
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:37,360
no other open issues okay so for this

1896
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:39,679
pcc for p2mp draft it

1897
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:40,559
uses psap to allocate the label

1898
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:43,760
instructions

1899
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:47,520
on the branch node for static p2mp

1900
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:50,480
rsv so it allows

1901
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,440
a multiple cci object for the

1902
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,879
replication at

1903
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:56,320
the branch node and again we also

1904
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:58,880
aligned and synced with

1905
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:01,519
other drafts and the furthermore for

1906
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,199
example we reorder the section

1907
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:08,239
as well and as well as some

1908
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,199
editorial real changes so again there is

1909
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:14,239
no other open

1910
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:16,960
issues next piece

1911
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:19,040
yeah so we would like to request for

1912
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:23,760
issuing the adoption call

1913
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,760
and uh thank you so any questions

1914
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,840
any questions

1915
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:42,719
okay uh thanks shipping oh there's eigen

1916
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:45,600

after you are inducted we know that the

1921
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:01,760
pcc for

1922
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:05,440
mps and pcc for srv6

1923
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:09,199
just for the seed or location you know

1924
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:13,199
i think i mean

1925
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:17,919
it is may make some person for confused

1926
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:21,199
with the pcc for a pc for sr policy

1927
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,400
so can we think some

1928
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:26,480
better to disincrease them you know

1929
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,839
this job this good job because only for

1930
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,799
the

1931
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,960
federal electrician from the pce and not

1932
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:36,480
related to the

1933
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,480
quality so

1934
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:42,080

suggesting

1937
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:49,920
a draft name change or uh title change

1938
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:52,000
yeah yeah okay i think we can take that

1939
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,760
into consideration uh shipping what do

1940
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,239
you think

1941
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,239
yeah sure we can discuss about it

1942
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:07,840
thank you so

1943
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:12,959

1944
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,960
thanks everyone

1945
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:20,000

okay very good i'm presenting on behalf

1948
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,920
of the culture and this is the

1949
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:31,360
psap extension to enable like this so

1950
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:34,880
next uh

1951
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:36,960
yeah firstly and just a few words about

1952
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,159
background and motivation so we already

1953
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,760
presented this

1954
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:44,080
uh during the last atf uh

1955
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,800
and we also had some discussion uh

1956
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:48,000
basically

1957
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:50,320
the id terms refers in this case to data

1958
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,760
plane on path telemetry technique so in

1959
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,159
band i am in situ

1960
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,280
i am an alternate marking and you can

1961
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:58,000
see

1962
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,960
the reference document for both this

1963
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,239
methodology

1964
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:04,080
and the psf extension defined

1965
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:05,280
is knockman allowed to signal these

1966
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:09,199
capabilities

1967
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:13,280
in order to uh enable these methods

1968
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:16,879
uh and to automatically activate them

1969
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,920
in particular um we aim to generalize

1970
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:24,159
these ip attributes to include

1971
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:31,840
uh this dlv's to be carried as lsp

1972
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:31,839
so next

1973
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,920
yeah in this slide we want to highlight

1974
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,519
the change

1975
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:42,159
after uh the last atf in particular

1976
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:44,400
uh the draft has deeply changed because

1977
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:47,839
you may recall that

1978
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:50,320
the first version was applied as tld to

1979
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,679
the association groups while this

1980
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,799
version

1981
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:58,800
extends this definition and

1982
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:01,760
and applied tlds for all part types

1983
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,199
and is applicable to lsp attributes so

1984
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,400
thanks drew for

1985
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:08,719
this input in this way

1986
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:10,239
we have generalized this application and

1987
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:15,840
the sr policy is

1988
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:19,040
now a news case of of this draft

1989
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:22,159
additionally we also got other comments

1990
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:24,080
uh in particular uh the suggestion from

1991
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:27,920
fenway to

1992
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:30,320
add different i feed capability flags

1993
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,280
in this way each capability can be

1994
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,840
advertised

1995
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,960
separately and this was already

1996
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,000
addressed in this

1997
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:41,280
in the camera and version

1998
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,080
we also had other inputs from

1999
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:45,759
ymo so thanks a lot and we also improved

2000
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:49,040
the graph

2001
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,920
to produce a new section about the

2002
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,719
precept

2003
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,520
messages and procedures for i'm leaving

2004
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,920
this tlb

2005
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,239
so we added more details about that as

2006
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,280
well as the example of application usa

2007
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:01,360
quality that

2008
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,719
as i mentioned before it's now just a

2009
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,719
new stage so next

2010
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:13,520
um yeah the psap extension correctly

2011
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:17,679
attributes uh the as i said the

2012
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:20,000
tlds are now carried inside the lsp

2013
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,960
attributes object and can be applicable

2014
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:25,199
for all five types so

2015
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,880
of course these dlvs are optional and

2016
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:29,199
can be taken into account

2017
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,480
by the pce during fast computation and

2018
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:35,280
by the pcc during path setup

2019
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:37,839
they can be carried within a pc initiate

2020
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:41,199
message a pc update message and pc

2021
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:44,080
is that report message

2022
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:45,759
in the case of sr policy of course these

2023
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:49,280
attributes also complement

2024
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:52,719
the pc segment rooting policy ct drop

2025
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,719
so next slide is

2026
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:58,000
um yeah what one before

2027
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:05,920
okay yeah we introduced the

2028
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,600
i feed capability advertisement clv so

2029
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,719
this is an optional tlv

2030
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,080
in the open object for capability

2031
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:15,679
advertisement so

2032
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:18,559
you can see the usual tlv format

2033
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,840
and five bits that we introduced in

2034
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,920
flags field

2035
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:27,600
to signal each capability and each

2036
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:29,120
i fit uh method separately so you can

2037
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,320
see one bit

2038
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:35,120
four bit for iom

2039
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,480
option flag and one bit for alternate

2040
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:39,920
marking

2041
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,718
flag so of course if it's set to one by

2042
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,440
pc

2043
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,600
by a pcc the flag indicate that pcc

2044
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:48,480
allows differentiation

2045
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,800
if set one by pce the flag indicate that

2046
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,879
pc supports the instantiation but

2047
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:57,920
anyway it should be it must be

2048
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:03,360
set by bot side to allow the

2049
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:03,360
ifit support tonight next glide

2050
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:11,199
now this is the ifit attribute tlv that

2051
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:14,320
is included in the lspa object

2052
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:15,280
and there are several sub tlds that are

2053
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:18,719
supported and

2054
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:21,360
that are shown in the next slide so

2055
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,360
next click

2056
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:29,360
yeah this slide showed the four iom

2057
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,320
sub tlds that are supported of course

2058
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,920
the reference

2059
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:37,040
is from the iom

2060
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,320
data draft in ippm so you can see all

2061
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,840
the

2062
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:42,320
iran allocators option incremental

2063
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:44,719
presumptions

2064
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:45,519
directly export option and direct search

2065
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,960
option

2066
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:48,960
subtle next

2067
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,840
this is the subtili for enhanced

2068
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:58,280
alternate marking

2069
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,239
also for this the reference is the

2070
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:10,880
rfc83.1 and

2071
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:13,839
the graph in six months nice

2072
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,840
next slightly

2073
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:28,320
yeah i lost the connection

2074
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:30,480
same here hello grove are you still with

2075
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:39,840
us

2076
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:39,839
can you hear me scream we can hear you

2077
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,759
hello no i can okay

2078
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,600
sorry about that yeah i can see your

2079
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,960
slides now

2080
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:07,480
yeah please resume your speech

2081
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,719
okay okay thank you

2082
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,799
[Music]

2083
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,639
yeah i was mentioning that yeah this is

2084
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,320
the alternate marking subtle

2085
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:20,639
so the reference is the

2086
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:24,480
erfc 321 and the six-month

2087
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:24,480
draft so next

2088
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,760
yeah this is what i mentioned before as

2089
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,040
an improvement

2090
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:36,080
after the itf-108 so

2091
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:40,000
we details how these dlvs are

2092
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:42,559
included in the pc in psf messages

2093
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,360
and also the example of application qsr

2094
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:48,560
policies to complement the

2095
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:52,080
segment routing policy cp draft

2096
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,760
so particular port pc initiated the lsp

2097
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,960
with ifit feature

2098
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,199
enabled this attribute must be included

2099
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,840
in

2100
01:30:57,199 --> 01:31:03,519
the lsp object in this pc initiate

2101
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:07,760
message

2102
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:09,600
after the instantiation of the lsp also

2103
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,920
they can be these attributes can be

2104
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,040
included in the pc

2105
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,080
report message to provide the status

2106
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:20,639
and when the lsp is uh instantiated the

2107
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:23,760
8-fit methods are applied as specified

2108
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:26,000
in the corresponding data plane document

2109
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,320
and you see the restaurant of course to

2110
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,120
update to disabling enabling this

2111
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,080
feature the

2112
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:35,280
pc update message can be used and the

2113
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:38,000
feed attributes can be included

2114
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,000
next slide

2115
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:44,000
yeah we want to continue to collect

2116
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,840
feedbacks

2117
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,480
for example we got some offline

2118
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,880
discussion with mike about

2119
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,638
the multiple segment list signaling

2120
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,840
based on the new draft that they are

2121
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:56,480
working on

2122
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:57,600
uh yeah of course these tlds can be

2123
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:00,638
extended also

2124
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,920
for multi-path uh tlvs as they are

2125
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,239
defining

2126
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,679
so let's see how if there is a new case

2127
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:10,000
we can also mention this in our draft

2128
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,760
anyway we aims that the working group

2129
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:14,880
can evaluate the adoption of

2130
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:18,000
this work as a

2131
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,000
base document for this and yeah of

2132
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,560
course other questions and comments are

2133
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,560
are welcome

2134
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:29,120
fabrice are you in the queue to ask a

2135
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,120
question or for the next presentation

2136
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,560
for the next presentation okay then mike

2137
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:43,600
go ahead

2138
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,480
uh just had a question about the general

2139
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,320
like ifit

2140
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:51,440
architecture for sr policy

2141
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:55,920
whether there are use cases where

2142
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:58,400
you could have different tracing options

2143
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,400
for you know different tracing options

2144
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,679
per segment list

2145
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:06,000
of the sr policy candidate path

2146
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:07,760
um you know as you know the sr policy

2147
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:11,360
candidate path it has multiple

2148
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:14,239
segment lists right and i kind of

2149
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:15,519
imagine you could have different tracing

2150
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,559
options for each segment list

2151
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,920
potentially

2152
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:20,040
i'm just wondering if that's been

2153
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:23,760
included in the actual

2154
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:26,239
architecture of ifit like outside of

2155
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,239
psap

2156
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,440
yes yes this is as i mentioned yeah this

2157
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:36,960
is something that

2158
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,960
uh we can consider as i don't know if is

2159
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,800
a use case that can happen very often

2160
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:44,080
but any

2161
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,000
in any way in any case we can refer your

2162
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:49,040
draft and we can say also that

2163
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:52,080
these dlvs can be applicable

2164
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:53,679
in that case yeah for multi-segmentally

2165
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,199
sure and i think the same thing has to

2166
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:58,320
be done for bgp

2167
01:33:55,199 --> 01:34:00,159
t uh equivalent of this draft i believe

2168
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:03,759
in there you also put the sub to v

2169
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:05,280
at the candidate path level so

2170
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:09,040
maybe it should be possible to put it at

2171
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,040
both levels if you're gonna do that

2172
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:13,040
thanks yeah yeah thank you

2173
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:20,559
thank you so i think we can move to the

2174
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:24,800
next presentation

2175
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,800
okay thank you bye

2176
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:33,839

01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:50,320
d4 from mtn cameroon

2180
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,280
and i'll be presenting to you uh the

2181
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:54,480
support for

2182
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:56,800
part mtu in uh v6 on the behalf of the

2183
01:34:54,480 --> 01:35:00,638
quarters

2184
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:04,159
uh drove next slide please so

2185
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,400
on this slide i'll try to give some sort

2186
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:08,960
of

2187
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:08,960
a motivation or some background

2188
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,639
generally why we think about that in

2189
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:16,800
pset

2190
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:18,719
when we're looking at the traditional

2191
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,840
mpls

2192
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:26,080
the pad mtu could be signaled by

2193
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:29,199
is being signaled by rsvpt and ldp

2194
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,760
as you can see in the rfc's that i

2195
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:33,440
mentioned

2196
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:35,360
but now when we go to uh segment routing

2197
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:37,280
parts we don't have any additional

2198
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:40,639
signaling for

2199
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:43,920
for pad mtu and

2200
01:35:40,639 --> 01:35:47,760
we currently we need that support

2201
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:51,040
uh what we can get

2202
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:54,000
excuse me from the uh sr

2203
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,679
is information gotten from bgpls and

2204
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,960
that is being

2205
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:03,440
used by pc to calculate but

2206
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:06,960
um when uh packets have been sent

2207
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:10,480
uh two things can happen if

2208
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:13,600
it is below the the the mtu size

2209
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:17,360
it can go through or if it is

2210
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:20,480
more you you have it been fragmented and

2211
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:23,759
this is a major concern when it comes to

2212
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:28,000
operator networks but because

2213
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,760
it it it um it affects greatly the the

2214
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,960
quality of service

2215
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:36,320
so uh with all these uh put in place

2216
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:38,400
uh we thought it necessary uh that it is

2217
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:42,159
important to do this extension

2218
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:45,040
in a preset message

2219
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:45,040
next like this

2220
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:52,000
now this client basically focuses on the

2221
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:56,080
metric object

2222
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:59,280
for part mtu uh how uh

2223
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:02,559
that is uh to be managed uh we

2224
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:06,080
have the for for this support of pad mtu

2225
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:07,520
we have the the b bit which is supposed

2226
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:10,559
to be set

2227
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,880
and now uh when this bit is set in the

2228
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:16,080
in the in the preset message then now

2229
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:18,880
the part m2 can be used as a condition

2230
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:20,080
or as a constraint when we want to

2231
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,679
calculate parts

2232
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:25,600
so we have the t field which is still a

2233
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:29,119
field that has to be determined

2234
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:32,080
determined by uh ayana

2235
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:32,080
next clip please

2236
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:40,800
now uh for this slide uh it basically

2237
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:43,440
gives uh uh what happens uh when we take

2238
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,600
this into consideration the part m2

2239
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:47,519
amongst other constraints that we can

2240
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:51,280
have between the

2241
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:54,800
the pcc and the pce so uh what happens

2242
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:57,519
is when the pcc

2243
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,560
has already selected the pc to

2244
01:37:57,520 --> 01:38:01,199
communicate with

2245
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,560
the pcc can send a path computational

2246
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:05,678
request

2247
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:08,000
a message to the pc with constraints the

2248
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,800
exposed constraints it can either be you

2249
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,840
have the soft

2250
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:14,080
address the destination address

2251
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:16,400
you can have the bandwidth you can have

2252
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:19,920
the set up the whole priority

2253
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:23,119
and in addition uh we have this part

2254
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:26,800
mtu and you can see that the b bit

2255
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:27,759
is being set to one so just to say that

2256
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,040
that is

2257
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,800
a field that has to be looked in in the

2258
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:35,920
message

2259
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,760
now uh when this uh pc has sent this

2260
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:42,840
request to the pce

2261
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:45,679
the pc now receives and computes

2262
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:47,600
successfully to satisfy the constraints

2263
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:51,280
that have been put in the

2264
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:52,719
in the packet and now focusing on the

2265
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,480
pce

2266
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:57,760
when on the uh part mtu it looks at this

2267
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:00,320
parameter

2268
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:00,960
and it can get back with the response

2269
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,239
meshes

2270
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:07,760
telling the pcc that okay i've

2271
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:09,119
gotten a successful path that you can

2272
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,000
use

2273
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,480
and now you can also have a case where

2274
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,880
this

2275
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:18,638
uh uh uh part is successful part of a

2276
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,679
condition the conditions are not

2277
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:22,760
fulfilled

2278
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:23,920
and now the pc he will get back to the

2279
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:28,239
pcc

2280
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:30,000
and uh indicate the conditions that led

2281
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:35,199
to the failure of

2282
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,199
getting a candidate path and now

2283
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:38,880
you can have now the you now then have

2284
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,480
the pc

2285
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:45,520
uh initiate message which is used

2286
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:48,799
by the pc to ask the pcc to set up a new

2287
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,440
lsp as well as provide the path mtu

2288
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:54,800
calculated for the path so that is what

2289
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:58,879
now the pcc would use to forward now the

2290
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:01,920
the the packet uh

2291
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:05,119
in this slide it is also important to

2292
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,760
mention that this new metric path

2293
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:08,400
of a type of pad mtu is applicable for

2294
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,639
both

2295
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:14,159
srt but and does not require any

2296
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:17,199
additional extensions

2297
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,199
next client please

2298
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,400
this is actually a draft that was being

2299
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:25,840
presented in

2300
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:28,320
the itf 108 session and

2301
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,320
we received a lot of comments which we

2302
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:33,519
have tried to amend

2303
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:34,320
and amongst those comments were for

2304
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,600
example

2305
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,840
trying to bring definitions for some of

2306
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,719
the technologies that sometimes cause

2307
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,719
confusion

2308
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,280
like the m2 the linkedin 2 and the

2309
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:48,080
pattern 2

2310
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,000
we also have the the m2 adjustment

2311
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:53,360
session that has been added to include

2312
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,360
the case protection for ti lfa

2313
01:40:53,360 --> 01:41:02,400
we did some few editorial changes

2314
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:05,519
and next client please

2315
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:09,360
we think that this is a a

2316
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:12,719
a a is a candidate for work of adoption

2317
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:16,400
and uh looking at how

2318
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:18,800
important this is uh i think

2319
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:21,199
that is a next step that we need to look

2320
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:25,119
at and

2321
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:28,400
we are open to questions

2322
01:41:25,119 --> 01:41:33,839
thank you thanks febreze mike

2323
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:33,839
go ahead

2324
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:38,719
yeah i wanted to i think it's a good

2325
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,520
draft first of all like uh

2326
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:42,159
it's useful uh i wanted to make one

2327
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,440
comment

2328
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:48,239
uh so again in the

2329
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:51,119
as you know the sr policy candidate path

2330
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:54,080
can have multiple segment lists right

2331
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:56,320
and you know those segment lists uh may

2332
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:58,239
have a different path mtu

2333
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,159
for example you may have like segment

2334
01:41:58,239 --> 01:42:03,599
lists and one of them has like

2335
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:05,679
a large mtu like say i don't know

2336
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:09,199
2000 or whatever and another one has

2337
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:12,480
like a smaller mtu like 1400

2338
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:15,519
so in that case you know uh

2339
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:17,360
i noticed that your path mtu is per

2340
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,639
candidate path

2341
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:24,799
so in that case you would have to report

2342
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:27,760
the lowest uh the minimum of those

2343
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,520
of the path mtu's of the constituent

2344
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:33,520
segment lists right

2345
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:37,040
exactly yeah so it might be useful

2346
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:40,719
to um to also report

2347
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:43,840
the path mtu of each individual segment

2348
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:43,840
list separately as well

2349
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:50,159
in case the the head end is able to

2350
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,360
kind of send different size packets to

2351
01:42:50,159 --> 01:42:54,000
different

2352
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:54,000
segment lists

2353
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:00,400
okay yeah uh i think uh wondering if

2354
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,520
if people don't think that's useful yeah

2355
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:05,040
thanks

2356
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:11,840
yeah thank you mike that's not it

2357
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:11,840
uh changi go ahead

2358
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:25,839
as we have defined

2359
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:39,840
yeah go ahead try speaking

2360
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:46,480
still bit low i think you are using your

2361
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,119
laptop speakers uh

2362
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,959
i will ask jeff to maybe go next while

2363
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:54,400
you figure it out and i will give you

2364
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:57,360
audio next uh jeff go ahead

2365
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:59,759
so i have a question uh how useful is

2366
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,080
actually in segment routine use cases

2367
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:04,239
the real constrain is amount of seats

2368
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:07,519
that we can impose

2369
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:08,559
and mtu is kind of implicit to that

2370
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,239
right

2371
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,080
so rather than knowing the amount of

2372
01:44:10,239 --> 01:44:15,519
beats you can push you're not going to

2373
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:17,360
fragment anywhere right the use of mtu

2374
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,719
is going to be eventually used to

2375
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:22,000
looking how many

2376
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:25,119
how deep your your

2377
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:28,000
list is so i think

2378
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:30,159
msd provides enough information to

2379
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,679
compute constraint but

2380
01:44:30,159 --> 01:44:33,280
i'm not sure you really need them to you

2381
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,840
for that just

2382
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:35,840
thinking loud

2383
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,719
hello guys okay

2384
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:44,719
yeah i could answer them to mike's

2385
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,920
question like

2386
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,800
uh as mike could note that we have to

2387
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,960
find the

2388
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:55,760
similar solutions in bgp as a policy

2389
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,320
and that path m2 is associated with the

2390
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:59,679
least

2391
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:02,960
seat least so i think this

2392
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:05,679
extension and pcp drafts that would be

2393
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,440
identical so yeah it would be i didn't

2394
01:45:05,679 --> 01:45:09,679
associated with the cities

2395
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,678
yep

2396
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,759
i understand what you're saying the

2397
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,159
point here

2398
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,880
eventually you would need to translate

2399
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:22,559
mtu

2400
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:24,320
into number of seats you

2401
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,480
you would be able to push through this

2402
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:28,480
interface without fragmentation right

2403
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:33,040
oh jeff uh we're not going to answer

2404
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:35,679
your question um

2405
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,480
answer the i'm sending the mike's

2406
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:44,719
question

2407
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:48,080
sorry and yeah

2408
01:45:44,719 --> 01:45:52,159
so uh regarding the uh msd uh

2409
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:54,400
uh like proposal i think it is valid and

2410
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,599
maybe we can make more discussion on the

2411
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:58,799
mayan list

2412
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:01,280
yeah sure absolutely

2413
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,920
yeah yeah i think i think we should just

2414
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:04,559
take that

2415
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:08,000
uh note of that and uh have further

2416
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:13,840
discussions on that yeah

2417
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,840
thanks everyone thank you

2418
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:20,080
[Music]

2419
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,080
the next presentation

2420
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,840
how mayan are you here

2421
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,719
i thought how mayan was presenting is

2422
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,719
how we are not here

2423
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:47,119
are you presenting this yes i'm a backup

2424
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:49,920
okay go ahead then okay yep

2425
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:51,280
so ladies and gentlemen uh my topic

2426
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:54,320
today is about a state

2427
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:55,519
synchronization between stateful pc and

2428
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,320
this is the first

2429
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:59,119
draft and in this slide we were going to

2430
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,480
uh

2431
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:05,759
uh present three drafts which are

2432
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:06,799
uh associating to with the uh state of

2433
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,840
opc

2434
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,840
so next please

2435
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,199
so uh roughly uh reminding of this draft

2436
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,799
is that uh

2437
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:22,080
in this draft we are going to propose

2438
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:25,920
the mechanism to synchronize these

2439
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:29,280
states among the uh stateful pce's

2440
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:31,840
right so uh the key concept of this

2441
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:32,559
uh document is that we we initiated this

2442
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,600
sync up

2443
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:38,560
pc sessions among stateful

2444
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:39,440
pcs and so that we can sync up the

2445
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,639
incremental

2446
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:45,839
lsp states during that session right

2447
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:48,880
so we also uh supports to set

2448
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:51,440
a primary and secondary

2449
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:53,040
pc for differentiate different

2450
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:55,919
responsibility

2451
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,800
the scenarios of this includes that we

2452
01:47:55,920 --> 01:48:00,159
can support

2453
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:02,480
redundance pces to support backup or

2454
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:04,719
like load balance and also we can

2455
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,759
support the scenarios like intel domain

2456
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:09,920
pcs or

2457
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:12,960
hierarchical pcs so and we have make a

2458
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:16,159
presentation in itf 105 and we

2459
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:19,840
have got some good support for adoption

2460
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:19,839
so next please

2461
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,920
hello next

2462
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,960
roof

2463
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:33,520
okay so this figure shows that

2464
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:35,840
how the mechanism works basically we

2465
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:39,440
will have like multiple pc's right

2466
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:43,119
so they need to sync up

2467
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:46,000
together so between the pc's we will

2468
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:46,559
send some like messages to think of the

2469
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,679
uh

2470
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:52,159
state among the pcs that's the main idea

2471
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:52,159
so next

2472
01:48:54,480 --> 01:49:00,239
so let's okay

2473
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:00,719
so to stay the status of this document

2474
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:04,080
uh

2475
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:06,239
after uh uh the the previous

2476
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,760
uh presentation is that we make some

2477
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:11,360
auditory changes

2478
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:14,960
to align with the recent i've seen like

2479
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:16,880
uh yeah so uh we also look at some like

2480
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,520
security consideration

2481
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,800
and so at this time we think the draft

2482
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,440
is stable and

2483
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:24,159
natural so we could like to request for

2484
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,559
a

2485
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:27,679
working group adoption of this document

2486
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:30,719
yeah

2487
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:33,520
so this all for the

2488
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,639
yeah the draft so should we go through

2489
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:37,199
all the drafts

2490
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:39,760
firstly and then go back to the

2491
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:41,919
discussion or one by one

2492
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,159
i think we can check if any comments on

2493
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:47,360
this document

2494
01:49:44,159 --> 01:49:49,519
okay and i see the q q is empty so we

2495
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:52,239
can move to the next one

2496
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:52,239
okay thank you

2497
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,000
so the second one is about extension for

2498
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:58,960
stateful pc

2499
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,239
to allow optional processing of pcp

2500
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:02,880
object you know

2501
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:02,879
yeah next

2502
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:09,040
as we uh okay so uh the summary of these

2503
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:12,960
drafts is that

2504
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:16,159
we clarified how the p flag and eye flag

2505
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,719
to be used uh so it can identify how to

2506
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:20,000
process

2507
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:20,960
the uh a pcb object and i think this

2508
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,400
kind of uh

2509
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:25,119
flag has flex has been have been defined

2510
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:28,320
in rfc

2511
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:31,040
like 54 40

2512
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,440
right so it will be introduced in the

2513
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:34,560
next

2514
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:38,000
slide so we update the handling of

2515
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:41,119
on how to handle the handling

2516
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,760
of and no objects based on these flags

2517
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,759
so next

2518
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:49,598
yeah the background the background of

2519
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:52,638
this

2520
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:57,040
p flag and ifrag is that they have

2521
01:50:52,639 --> 01:51:00,159
been defined in ifc uh 5440

2522
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:03,040
and the p flag is used for uh in

2523
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:03,920
indicating that the pce master

2524
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,360
processing

2525
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,119
must process the the objects and the eye

2526
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:12,880
flag indicate that

2527
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:16,320
you can ignore it right so but in

2528
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:20,320
i've seen like 8231

2529
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:24,400
and has specified that in the stateful

2530
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:28,080
pce uh it can

2531
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:29,119
like like uh it can it must be set to

2532
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:31,519
zero

2533
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:32,239
and it should be ignored right so in

2534
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:36,080
this draft

2535
01:51:32,239 --> 01:51:39,598
we define the specific uh

2536
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:41,920
how say processing of this two flags

2537
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:41,920
next

2538
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:47,280
yeah so this slide shows the p flag and

2539
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,639
i flag

2540
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:54,239
usage do

2541
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:54,719
okay i will not go into the details so

2542
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,759
let's

2543
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:57,760
skip that this part

2544
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:04,400
yeah this is the uh whole uh

2545
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:07,679
flowchart of the uh processing

2546
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:10,400
of unknown object right so when the p

2547
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:11,440
plug is set it means that we have to

2548
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:15,519
process

2549
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:17,119
this object otherwise we do not need to

2550
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:20,159
uh

2551
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:24,000
the pcp speaker is free to

2552
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:27,759
process it or not based on its

2553
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:28,239
like local policy so if the p flag is

2554
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,679
set

2555
01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:32,080
and the object is unknown then we have

2556
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:35,199
two

2557
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:39,040
ways to go uh if the i flag is set

2558
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:42,320
then how to do that and if i flag is

2559
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:45,920
no set and the pcp

2560
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:49,920
is also afraid to ignore it or not

2561
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,920
so uh next

2562
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:58,239
so the status of this draft is that we

2563
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:01,440
uh we get a confirmation

2564
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:05,119
of the problem statement on the list

2565
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:05,678
and and i think we get uh consensus

2566
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:09,280
about

2567
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:12,080
uh this extension is useful right

2568
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:12,800
so uh we also make some editorial

2569
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,159
changes

2570
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:18,719
to think of the recent recent ifcs after

2571
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:22,400
the itf 105.

2572
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:25,360
so in order to progress the dot

2573
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,839
document i will request for working

2574
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:29,519
group

2575
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:33,119
adoption of this document yeah

2576
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:33,119
are there any questions on this document

2577
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:37,280
okay let's move ahead

2578
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,840
okay

2579
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,599
next

2580
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:53,199
uh are you not seeing the i cannot

2581
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:56,159
uh i am on the page which says vendor

2582
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:58,400
specific information

2583
01:53:56,159 --> 01:54:00,239
yeah right now i can see the slide so

2584
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:03,519
the last draft is about the

2585
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:05,199
uh it's about conveying the vendor

2586
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,880
specific information

2587
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:10,960
in pcp extension for a study for pce

2588
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,080
and i think some vendors have

2589
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:16,239
implemented it

2590
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:16,239
already right so next please

2591
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:24,799
oh there are some delays between me and

2592
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:28,560
the

2593
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:31,920
miracle yep so the main idea is

2594
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:35,760
of this draft is to uh conveying the uh

2595
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:39,280
kvd vendor specific information

2596
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:42,400
between the pcp speakers so we have

2597
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:45,119
a mega presentation in itf 105

2598
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:45,839
and also we got some like good support

2599
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:50,320
right

2600
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:53,040
next please

2601
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:53,679
yeah i don't think we can i don't think

2602
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:58,639
we need to

2603
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:58,639
go into the detail of this slide next

2604
01:55:02,239 --> 01:55:06,000
so the main change is that uh we make

2605
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:08,799
some auditory changes

2606
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,239
we think to to to align with a recent

2607
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:12,880
ifc as well yeah

2608
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:13,839
after the meeting last presentation and

2609
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:17,520
we

2610
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:21,760
added the implementation state case

2611
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:25,520
from cisco they they and we add two more

2612
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:29,040
causes as well and also we request for

2613
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:33,040
working adoption of this document yep

2614
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:35,760
that's all comments are welcome

2615
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:35,760
any comments

2616
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:41,520
uh from the chase perspective uh uh we

2617
01:55:40,239 --> 01:55:42,879
wanted to ask uh

2618
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:45,199
like you know these documents have been

2619
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:47,599
stable since idea 105

2620
01:55:45,199 --> 01:55:49,119
so if there are any objections to

2621
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:50,239
progressing them or you think that they

2622
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:52,239
are not useful

2623
01:55:50,239 --> 01:56:01,678
now would be a good time for the working

2624
01:55:52,239 --> 01:56:05,598
group to speak up

2625
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:07,760
okay uh uh julian you have any famous

2626
