i would like to sign them up but they're

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,039
a little bit uh lazy at the moment

6
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,599
i think i have one on the floor here and

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,239
one on a chair sitting on the back

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,239
hey brandon

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,839
good morning everyone

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,120
looks like we're at the uh appropriate

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,199
time maybe we should get started

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,839
yeah we're waiting for dave to put some

13
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,839
slides up

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:13,840
the other day

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,439
okay so apparently it didn't work

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,320
okay so you're going to put the slides

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,919
up now yeah i headed up and as soon as i

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,839
logged on to the second machine it

19
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
stopped sharing on the first one so

20
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,839
all right can you see my screen i can

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,840
okay all right so let's go ahead and get

22
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
started

23
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:22,640
the this is the suit working group

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:25,120
at itf 109 next slide

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,399
uh by by this point of the week you

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,599
should probably have seen

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,519
uh notewell many times uh please

28
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,640
if you're going to contribute in any way

29
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
make sure you're

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,760
aware of these uh

31
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,319
rights privileges and responsibilities

32
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,319
next slide

33
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:53,040
blue sheets are taken care of by medico

34
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
do we have a note taker

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:04,560
somebody take notes within the codemd

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:07,920
tab please

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,879
we really need someone to do this i can

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,399
i can uh take some notes thank you very

39
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,840
much

40
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,560
is that honest yeah yep thanks

41
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:32,239
thank you okay i will watch the jabber

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:35,200
dave your screen went away

43
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
did we lose dave

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
i don't know why the way oh it's the

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
infinite tunnel

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
yes because i have to go back to that

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
screen in order to publish again so if

48
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,560
it goes away again i can hear your rust

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,760
but for some reason it stopped sharing

50
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,319
in the middle so

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,959
uh call me out if that happens again

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,920
okay

53
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
uh can we go back to the uh the slide

54
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,958
after note well please

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599
all right good no i think we just sorted

56
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
that next one

57
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:17,440
okay so uh this is the agenda for today

58
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,160
um we basically have two documents that

59
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,320
are out of the working group and so we

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,280
have them on the agenda just to discuss

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
any issues that are raised either by the

62
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,239
isg or

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,840
the ietf last call then

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,160
we'll turn to the suit manifest

65
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,799
we have a few open issues and the the

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,639
goal is to get that ready for

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,320
working group last call and then

68
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:49,600
we have two uh non-working group

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,800
uh documents that we will get to

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,720
if uh if time allows uh

71
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,040
with the goal of seeing if they're ready

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,919
for work and group adoption

73
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,919
next slide please

74
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,680
and this is the uh milestones for the

75
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,520
work

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,800
group we're behind on the manifest

77
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,400
document that uh should have been done

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,240
um in march 2020 um

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,599
obviously the world has changed since

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,120
march 2020

81
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,160
but uh we will hopefully be able to sort

82
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
out

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
a great deal of that today i think

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,919
that's

85
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,320
so the the question is any agenda of

86
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,320
ashes

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,400
okay uh hearing none um

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,479
so the first thing we're going to talk

89
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,359
about is the uh

90
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,080
uh architecture document i think i think

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,680
dave is going to lead that is that right

92
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,800
brendan i think okay

93
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,600
all right i'm happy either way

94
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,240
uh okay are you gonna share or is uh

95
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,240
dave gonna run it

96
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,600
i i have all the slides as long as you

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
can see the slide can you guys see the

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
slide right now

99
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,800
yep okay then i'm happy to run stuff if

100
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
you just want to tell me next slide next

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,840
presentation whatever brendan

102
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,919
okay okay brendan all right

103
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,000
and unless you have any updated slides i

104
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,440
i'm still using the the batch that you

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
sent me earlier so

106
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
yeah no it's nothing's changed since

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
then

108
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,639
okay go for it right so uh

109
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,679
suit architecture has gone through iesg

110
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,960
evaluation

111
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,880
and mostly we've got um

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,880
just a relatively few number of comments

113
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,400
the uh the ballot positions have all

114
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,199
been no objection

115
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,679
uh typically no objection with comment

116
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,039
uh

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
mostly this is a question surrounding

118
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,759
questions around the

119
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,880
clarity of um what's required in the

120
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
architecture

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
versus what is a requirement of the

122
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,599
serialization

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so we just need a couple of words here

124
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,159
and there

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
to make it clear exactly where the

126
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
requirement lies

127
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,080
the one thing that came up which i think

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
we probably

129
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,960
need to address is whether any

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,680
of the documents that we reference

131
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,280
should be normative references now my

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,360
concern here is i

133
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,440
i as you can see there's a few

134
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,720
references we make to

135
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,560
other drafts that are ongoing

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
uh if we're not careful here we're going

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,960
to make quite a big cluster

138
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,440
so i guess the question i've got is

139
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,880
whether

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,880
any of these documents are actually

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
normative to the content of the suit

142
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,639
architecture

143
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,198
or whether all of these documents should

144
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,479
be left

145
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,120
as informational or to be more specific

146
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,080
as forward references for places that

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:59,039
the content

148
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:02,080
of the architecture becomes relevant

149
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,159
so that's really the summary um

150
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,599
i i personally think that what we should

151
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,720
do is leave the references as

152
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,520
informational

153
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
i don't think any of these are actually

154
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,520
normative

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,639
to the uh content of the

156
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,359
architecture itself

157
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
yeah this is dave thaler i agree sorry i

158
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,599
can't put myself in queue while i'm

159
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,719
presenting but uh

160
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,199
yeah i agree with that gone um this is

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,319
russ

162
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:32,159
i uh agree as well the only one that

163
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,440
i question is the rats architecture

164
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,240
um but

165
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,000
i i think it i think it uh informative

166
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
is fine

167
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,679
it'll be an information all the

168
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,480
architecture documents

169
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,239
uh suit teep and rats will all be

170
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
informational so an informational

171
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,760
reference should be fine

172
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,640
so my rationale for even the rats

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,160
architecture

174
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,279
i so teep depends on suit and rats

175
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
um but i don't believe that rats the the

176
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,399
suit depends on teep it's the only other

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,599
direction and i don't believe that suit

178
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
depends on rats either

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,880
right it's just indirect by t depending

180
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,640
on both of them for example

181
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
so i don't think there's anything that

182
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
you wouldn't refer to for would refer to

183
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
rats in a normative fashion for us so i

184
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,360
think that they're all informative

185
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,279
seems fine so let's proceed that way

186
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
uh i'm not hearing anybody uh or not

187
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,160
seeing anybody in jabber

188
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
um i think otherwise and no one's in

189
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,439
queue

190
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,839
so i think that's what we have i think

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
that about sums it up

192
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,160
okay so ready to move on to the next

193
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
presentation brennan

194
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
unless there's any other questions or

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,399
comments on the student architecture

196
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,800
i'm going to keep that up since i um

197
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,560
i had uh maybe this is hannah's uh maybe

198
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,719
you've seen i've just um

199
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
provided a couple of pull requests uh in

200
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,279
response to the

201
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,680
isg reviews in in order to

202
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,120
address some of the editorial changes i

203
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,479
think they are pretty straightforward

204
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
don't need any discussion

205
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:19,839
i just want to let you know that

206
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,839
i acted on them

207
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,680
okay so uh the suit information model

208
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,359
as far as i'm aware has

209
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,640
actually just exited isc iesg last call

210
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,800
i saw an email about last call expired

211
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
and started seeing some commentary come

212
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
in afterwards so

213
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,880
that's my understanding of where it is

214
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,439
um we have only received two reviews so

215
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
far

216
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,839
gen art said absolutely nothing other

217
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,119
than looks fine

218
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
um sector says not ready i think that

219
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,720
this

220
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,000
is really a contextual

221
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,959
issue more than anything else and the

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,640
reviewer from sector essentially said

223
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
that he didn't look like an information

224
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,839
model to him

225
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,439
and well fair enough it's not it's an

226
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,959
information model and a threat

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,760
model and i asked if we changed the name

228
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
to that

229
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
if that would fix the problem and he

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
said yes

231
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
so i'm wondering if we should change the

232
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
name to

233
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
information and threat model in an

234
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
effort

235
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,920
to make it clear what the content is

236
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
you're just talking about the title of

237
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,959
the document on the front page

238
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
literally the title of the document yes

239
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,279
okay not

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,360
the draft string file no

241
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,000
okay thank you

242
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
sounds good to me okay works for me too

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,639
um

244
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,959
he also uh drew out that

245
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,000
the order of the sections is slightly

246
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,680
confusing now

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,200
of course what's happened here is that

248
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,359
we originally had

249
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
threats and user stories followed by

250
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,440
requirements

251
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,880
followed by elements but then

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,000
there was the um the point

253
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,920
that the content that the majority of

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,279
people will be looking for

255
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,760
is the element of the uh manifest

256
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,680
which should then be at the front but we

257
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
didn't then put the requirements after

258
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,959
the threats

259
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
and user stories which means that

260
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,680
there's a kind of a zigzag

261
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,480
in the story of the document as you go

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,599
through it

263
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,120
and that was considered confusing

264
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,079
so should we reorder the sections

265
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,959
to go elements requirements and then

266
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:56,160
threats and user stories

267
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:58,000
um uh put me in queue i don't know if

268
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,360
other people are in qrs

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,360
i think hank is first

270
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,040
uh hi oh hi brenton so uh

271
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
personally i think whatever order you

272
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
choose it's the wrong one

273
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,560
so that's first i think this is a

274
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
of course so but this is i think that is

275
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,680
correct

276
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,200
this is about people want to understand

277
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,359
and implement this

278
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,320
so i see the point ietf elements first

279
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,480
although of course that is a wrong order

280
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,120
if you inherit this wrong order

281
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
you should inverse it and that is

282
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,240
elements requires

283
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,240
threats uh you could uh uh

284
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,079
alleviate this problem by naming it

285
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,639
threaten information model and then use

286
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,760
the correct order

287
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,959
but again i think iatf is

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,240
the place where you start with the

289
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,239
elements and that's okay

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
i think dave you said you were in queue

291
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,279
any further comments

292
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,560
um uh yeah

293
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,480
um my personal preference and i

294
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,839
agree that it's a matter of maybe it's

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,440
preference but um

296
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,279
i like the order that things are in

297
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
right now which gives

298
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,680
uh because when we first put the things

299
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,600
in that order i found that it gave a

300
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,199
natural flow right that says

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,880
here's the the things we're trying to

302
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
accomplish which then

303
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
these leads to these requirements which

304
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
then leads to these solutions

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
so i thought that was a fairly logical

306
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,880
flow so uh hank said one thing i was

307
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,120
going to say

308
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,639
which is maybe the name of the document

309
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
should be threat model and information

310
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
model

311
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
so that it matches stuff and then i

312
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,599
might have the table of contents be

313
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
organized such

314
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,519
as a section inside the document that is

315
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,519
called threat model

316
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
and then a section is called information

317
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,720
model after that

318
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,160
okay and so that means that the title

319
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
would be threat model information model

320
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,439
the table of contents would be

321
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,639
structured like threat model and then

322
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,399
after that would be the information

323
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
model section and then the elements are

324
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,519
in the information model section right

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
and so if you only care about that

326
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,279
you jump to the information model

327
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,560
section but i think that would be less

328
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,279
work than trying to reflow the texts

329
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,199
to make um uh you know backwards

330
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,480
reference stitches to terms and things

331
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,000
like that you have to fix up

332
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,760
and so i like the order fixing

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,560
that but we might like to make them

334
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,199
all of the references are symbolic so uh

335
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,839
reflowing it's trivial

336
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
yeah so anyway i like the order that it

337
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,199
is right now

338
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
but i would change the title and the uh

339
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,639
table of contents

340
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,680
uh you know section ordering section

341
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,519
labels i should say

342
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,040
to match the direct model information

343
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
terms but it's just a matter of

344
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,480
preference right so

345
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,758
i should probably clarify that what we

346
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,880
have right now

347
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,759
the order is elements

348
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
then threats then requirements which is

349
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,000
why

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
i say there's this bit of a zigzag at

351
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,240
the moment okay sorry

352
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,279
i thought was that a change that was a

353
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,040
change yes

354
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,920
that was what was the original that

355
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,519
change happened a long time ago

356
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
okay what was the original refresh my

357
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,360
memory the original was

358
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,719
threats requirements information

359
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
elements

360
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,000
okay that's the one that i remembered in

361
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,519
my head um

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
which that order is the one that i was

363
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,240
saying that made sense to me when i

364
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,479
first read that version of the document

365
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
is that particular order that version is

366
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,519
the one that tells a story

367
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,680
yeah it makes perfect yeah i like that

368
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,320
way yeah but at the same time

369
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,199
as as hank correctly points out the ietf

370
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,759
is a place where

371
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,758
people you know come not to learn about

372
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,000
the threats to their devices but how to

373
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,440
implement things

374
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,399
yeah so it's a matter of preference i

375
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,199
don't feel strongly either way so

376
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,199
okay so i mean i would be happy to

377
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,479
change it to threaten information model

378
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,079
and stick the information elements at

379
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,120
the end

380
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,800
i just thought it was interesting that

381
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,920
both hank and i both suggested that i

382
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,599
don't know what the rest of the work

383
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
thinks but uh

384
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,920
does anyone have any strong opinions on

385
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,920
this

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,319
so what is what is the proposal from

387
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,198
hank uh

388
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,399
threats and then requirements elements

389
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,600
or which order

390
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
i just for the meeting minutes

391
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,119
um so this is the thing again in the

392
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,719
minutes yes the the

393
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,559
the the story that brent was talking

394
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
about is threats then deriving

395
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,760
requirements from threats

396
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
and then uh certifying them for the

397
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,720
elements and that that is the story yes

398
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
which was the original story in the

399
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,120
first version of the draft is what

400
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
brennan was explaining

401
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,840
yep

402
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,840
sounds like people like the story all

403
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,840
right let's go back to the story version

404
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,199
but but make it clear in the you know in

405
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
the table of contents and if you want

406
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
the elements

407
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,879
here's where to jump and you could even

408
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,199
put a sentence in the introduction if

409
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,919
you're an implementer

410
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,880
jump to the c-section you know c-section

411
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,679
five or whatever that

412
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,160
would be so yeah i'm as in the uh

413
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,960
manifest document uh having a how to use

414
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:14,640
this document

415
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:17,280
is probably a good thing yep

416
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
all right um then there were a couple of

417
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,918
nits

418
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,320
on um the the use of required versus

419
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,880
optional as applying to serialization

420
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,439
so essentially what's going on here is

421
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,200
that

422
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,240
the information model is saying that a

423
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,440
uh the support for a particular

424
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,120
um information element must

425
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,440
exist in a in any given serialization

426
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:48,479
format but that it is optional to use

427
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,120
in any given manifest so you have a

428
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,600
strange

429
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,320
uh completion of required and optional

430
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,959
in the same

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,639
element and there were a couple of

432
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,480
places that that cropped up

433
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,679
and the reviewer felt that it would be

434
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
helpful to clarify

435
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,960
exactly what was required and what was

436
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,960
optional

437
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,120
so i think that one's relatively

438
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,240
straightforward the only other thing

439
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,799
that came up

440
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,600
really in the review was a question

441
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,639
about

442
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,918
whether there is some canonical

443
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,280
source of a reference to the stride uh

444
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,679
threat modeling methodology and that the

445
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,840
one that we currently have in there may

446
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
not be sufficiently canonical and might

447
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,760
cease to exist at some point in the

448
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
future

449
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,320
remind me which one do we point to right

450
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,200
now do we point to the microsoft source

451
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,879
or what's the

452
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,320
what's what's the destination reference

453
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,840
right now we are pointing to

454
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,360
a microsoft source um i i don't know if

455
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,959
it is

456
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
you know if there's any guarantee that

457
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
it will continue to live where it

458
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
currently is

459
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,200
uh the uh hold on i'm just loading the

460
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,559
uh

461
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,160
the exact location all right hand i

462
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,678
don't know of a more canonical

463
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
uh reference i don't know if somebody

464
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,760
else does but the stride module model

465
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,760
originated from microsoft but it's not

466
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,039
microsoft specific anymore

467
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,039
but i don't know of a better reference

468
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,600
right now

469
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,158
so the one that we're pointing to uh

470
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,840
just

471
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:26,000
sorry one moment

472
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,039
is uh we're pointing to one that

473
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,919
is coming from

474
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,039
msdn so i don't know if we're gonna get

475
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,880
any more canonical than that

476
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,679
right all right

477
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
showing up in somebody's uh book that's

478
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
been published or something like that

479
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,239
but

480
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,678
the msdn might be the best online

481
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,280
reference that exists but

482
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,320
like i said i suspect it's showing up in

483
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,960
one or more physical publications

484
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,678
i i think the concern is that it's at

485
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,799
something that's hanging off of an msdn

486
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,960
library with a variety of alphanumeric

487
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,039
characters followed by an aspx

488
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,799
and if microsoft chooses to reorganize

489
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,039
the site it might disappear

490
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,000
gotcha um if it would have helped so

491
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,919
microsoft

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,679
has the ability to create short links

493
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,559
like aka dot

494
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
ms slash whatever the well maybe it's

495
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,600
called an fw link so there's a number of

496
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,760
things that when

497
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,918
microsoft publishes references to its

498
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,039
own msdn things it uses something that

499
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,200
it can

500
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,080
redirect if msdn ever changes that

501
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,679
structure

502
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
so if it would help i can find out if

503
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,559
there is one if not i can get one

504
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,239
created that is a

505
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,399
stable link that even if the structure

506
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
changes the link itself would still be

507
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,640
uh it would be still would still be

508
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,080
stable i think that would be helpful

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,240
um unless there's some relatively

510
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,678
canonical reference outside of microsoft

511
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,440
that's likely to be more stable

512
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,799
i i don't know what the right answer is

513
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,720
here so i i

514
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,720
defer to people with more experience in

515
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,159
these references

516
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
yeah maybe somebody in the working group

517
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,240
will post one in the jabber or on the

518
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,760
list or whatever but otherwise i can do

519
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,679
the fault back and get a

520
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,679
what what uh msdn calls an fw link

521
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,440
which is always a redirector to the

522
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,799
actual page

523
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,200
yeah i think that it would be a benefit

524
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,720
not just a suit but the entire community

525
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,320
to be able to reference that okay so

526
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,760
uh hannah's put that in the minutes that

527
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,840
i have an action item unless somebody

528
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,840
else beats me to it with a better

529
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
reference

530
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,840
all right i think that's it for the

531
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,840
information model unless there are any

532
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,840
further comments

533
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,640
okay so let's go on to the manifest

534
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,240
thread modeling um book the wiley book

535
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
by showstack that talks about stride we

536
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,600
could

537
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,600
maybe point to that

538
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,840
i pressed the amazon link in the chat

539
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,480
sorry i might have missed my window but

540
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,879
um i was just curious dave

541
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
we're when you talk about this and open

542
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
information model where were you

543
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,320
specifying this would be

544
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,320
um set up and specified

545
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,960
sorry i didn't understand who that was a

546
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,080
question for and what the question was

547
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,480
can you repeat

548
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,360
i'm sorry david the questions for you

549
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
question was

550
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,559
when you said what we're going to define

551
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,120
this in the standard data model

552
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,080
uh where is this defined and where can i

553
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,439
download the schema to understand it

554
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,279
i don't think we ever use the term data

555
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,120
model anytime in this meeting

556
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,480
well my apologies if you didn't but the

557
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,559
way i represented your

558
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,080
what you presented there would be a

559
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,520
standardized data model for how i can

560
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
understand

561
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,679
at least a schema for how sweet

562
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,918
communicates

563
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,120
ah in that sense the data model is the

564
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,600
document that we're showing on the

565
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,799
screen

566
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,799
right now that we're about to talk about

567
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
the suit manifest in that section oh so

568
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,158
well

569
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,840
i'm just hitting me up okay that's cool

570
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,640
sorry about that maybe i'll get ahead of

571
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,559
myself

572
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
okay now i think i understand your

573
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,639
question and that is this document that

574
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,600
is

575
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
that we're going to spend the bulk of

576
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,080
the time on

577
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,279
well actually in i hope that it's not

578
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,320
going to be that

579
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,760
uh complicated but it uh yeah if you go

580
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,279
here's the other ones

581
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,720
slides so this one has more than one

582
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:46,400
slide though

583
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:49,520
oh no all right

584
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
shall we so we started yeah

585
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,360
okay so there are a few technical

586
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,880
changes um but they are

587
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,520
relatively minor there's only one that

588
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,200
might be considered breaking and that is

589
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,639
separating the digest

590
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,440
out from uh cozy sign and cozy mac

591
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
previously that was the payload of the

592
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,440
cozy

593
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,640
object or cozy structure i mean

594
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,039
uh the rest of these are additions and

595
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,039
they

596
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:22,640
are hopefully relatively straightforward

597
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,360
uh so let's move on

598
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
next slide please yeah there we go uh so

599
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,918
first off

600
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,400
private enterprise number there was some

601
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,640
discussion in ietf 108

602
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,320
about using uh private enterprise

603
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,360
numbers rather than

604
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,399
the uuid based vendor ids

605
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,439
so what i've done is looked

606
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,559
at what options we have for

607
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,880
encoding a private enterprise number now

608
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,320
since private enterprise numbers are

609
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,679
actually oids

610
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,760
that are relative to the

611
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,760
the ietf private enterprise number oid

612
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,520
it seemed like the best thing to do was

613
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,080
retain those semantics

614
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,120
so since uh ietf seaboard tags oid

615
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,399
has cropped up it seemed like

616
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,360
this being an a c board document having

617
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
a

618
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,039
seabor representation of an oid was

619
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,320
probably the right answer

620
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,080
especially given that we have a a tag

621
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,879
for a relative

622
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
oid now what i've done is i've gone one

623
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,360
step further than that

624
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,080
and i have asked uh the authors of that

625
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,439
draft

626
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,399
to also include a specific tag for a

627
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,120
pen so what that is is semantics that

628
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,880
are almost

629
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:44,399
identical to the relative oid

630
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,200
but because they are understood to be

631
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
relative

632
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,360
to the private enterprise number oid

633
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,600
they actually resolve to a full oid

634
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,158
because we already know what that prefix

635
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,760
is

636
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:01,120
so now we have a way to encode not just

637
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,879
the numeric pen but the any

638
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,279
sub-assignments that might show up

639
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,760
as well so the the change here in cddl

640
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
terms

641
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,840
is shown below what we've added is the

642
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,960
option of specifying a pen

643
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,678
instead now because a uuid is a byte

644
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,080
string

645
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,480
and a sebor pen is a tagged value this

646
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,399
is

647
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
relatively straightforward to understand

648
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,279
so that is so next slide please

649
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,000
this has some ramifications um for class

650
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,080
id

651
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,799
so the way that class id was supposed to

652
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,158
be constructed was to use the uuid

653
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,760
version of the vendor id as a uuid

654
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,000
namespace and then derive the class id

655
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
from

656
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,760
any class specific information and that

657
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,919
uuid

658
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,320
but that's not going to work if the

659
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,880
vendor id isn't a uuid

660
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,320
so what i've done is provided a

661
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,480
canonical way

662
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,600
of converting a uh

663
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:12,240
as a pen to

664
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:16,158
a uuid so that you can then derive a

665
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,799
class id from it so what this requires

666
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,919
is

667
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,639
the the pen as uh

668
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,360
with the tag all of that as the cpor pen

669
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,399
element

670
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,760
that's listed down below and

671
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,918
it requires a name space for those so

672
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,919
for the name space next slide please

673
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:45,760
next slide please oh there we are um

674
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,960
yeah so the uh

675
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,559
way that the the namespace id is defined

676
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,000
is by going through and um

677
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,840
constructing a namespace id from

678
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,960
the existing oid namespace using the

679
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,840
seabor oid encoding of the

680
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,640
private enterprise number it seemed like

681
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,199
the

682
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
most sensible thing to do but in actual

683
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
fact

684
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,480
all that's really necessary is that

685
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,080
uh uuid at the very bottom it doesn't

686
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,080
actually matter what the value is

687
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,760
as long as i i think this matches

688
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,279
our discussion at ietf 108 from my

689
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,000
recollection that this looks good i

690
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,960
think this matches what we had discussed

691
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,760
was the direction to you to do so so

692
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,360
that is all

693
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,840
done now um

694
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,840
next slide

695
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,799
so um we also discussed at ietf 108 the

696
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,000
idea of removing the suit digest from

697
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,720
the cozy payload

698
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,200
and making it the first element in the

699
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
uh

700
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,640
the suit off list now the reason for

701
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,440
this

702
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,480
is that it could show up multiple times

703
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,399
if

704
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:10,320
the uh cozy sign one or cosy mac

705
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,719
zero uh objects are used

706
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,720
and there's more than one signature it

707
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,240
could also show up multiple times

708
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,080
if the cosy sign or cozy mac parameters

709
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
are incompatible

710
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,559
meaning that you can't just add another

711
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,000
signature to your existing sign one or

712
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,000
sorry existing cozy sign

713
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,880
what this does mean is that it enforces

714
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,120
that each manifest can have only a

715
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,960
single canonical digest with a

716
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,760
single uh choice for what the

717
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,399
what type of digest it is so that means

718
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,840
that you can't refer to a given manifest

719
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,918
with both a sha-256 and a

720
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,600
that would be invalid because the mana

721
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,000
the the digest that shows up

722
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,840
in that manifest would be one or the

723
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,919
other not both

724
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
this is actually convenient in one

725
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,200
respect i can see how

726
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,720
it might be disadvantageous if you want

727
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,240
to be able to

728
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,399
have two different versions however when

729
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,039
it comes to dependency handling

730
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,239
being able to identify one dependency by

731
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,200
one digest

732
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,880
is probably the right thing anyway so

733
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
specifying that there is only one

734
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,519
canonical way to refer

735
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,120
to each manifest is actually a

736
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:31,360
benefit however what it does mean

737
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,279
is that if you have two recipients that

738
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,519
don't support the same digest

739
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,360
parameters there's no way to send an

740
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,880
identical manifest

741
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,439
to both of them i think that's a

742
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,600
bit of a corner case i don't think i'm

743
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,399
overly worried about that particular

744
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,719
problem

745
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,719
so i think this is probably fine

746
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,158
the the change to serialization is

747
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,440
essentially that

748
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,600
item 0 in the suit off list

749
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,960
signature list is what i've written here

750
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,199
is a suit digest

751
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
and all subsequent elements are some

752
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,720
form of cozy authentication structure

753
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,959
either sine or mac or sine one or mach

754
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,720
zero

755
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,559
uh so matthew your hands up is that

756
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,559
about this or is that an old hand

757
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,840
apologies it's still up

758
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,519
so if you click the hand again it'll

759
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,519
take your hand down

760
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,440
if i clicked it twice

761
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,440
well it's up right now

762
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,960
okay my apologies i'm not trying to

763
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,200
disrupt i just

764
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,240
my my mistake my apologies oh no worries

765
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,720
so i think that's the um

766
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,720
that that's it for the uh removal of

767
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,679
suit digest what it means is essentially

768
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,159
that we're

769
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,039
using the cozy authentication structures

770
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,640
in detached mode

771
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,000
uh next slide please

772
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,640
i've added into c board tags i don't

773
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,840
know if

774
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,880
these are the right values but the the

775
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,678
argument i'll make

776
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,320
is that suit envelope is likely to show

777
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,559
up

778
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,760
uh on especially in constrained

779
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,480
connections

780
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,799
far more often than suit manifest with

781
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,919
uh

782
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,879
as as a bear item and as a result

783
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,720
i think that we should um preferentially

784
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,960
aim for a smaller value on

785
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,120
envelope than on manifest now that said

786
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,000
we have a structure that's usually

787
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,120
around 300 bytes including signature

788
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,919
so quibbling over a two byte tag

789
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,439
i think is probably unnecessary and i

790
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,480
would be happy

791
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,440
with a three byte tag so we could

792
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,640
probably go

793
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,919
over the 256 boundary without

794
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,039
really much noticeable cost

795
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,679
and knowing that many of these tags are

796
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,159
in short supply i i don't see a problem

797
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,159
with that

798
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,919
so maybe we should change that if if

799
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,000
anyone has a particular

800
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,440
uh idea on on what tag value we should

801
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,239
look for i know that

802
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,879
choosing uh tags that resolve to ascii

803
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,719
characters

804
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,399
is popular then uh perhaps we

805
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,399
someone has a suggestion

806
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
sure sure i'm just waiting for someone

807
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,679
to pop up and

808
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,639
say ah pick this one but

809
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,480
maybe i'll leave that to the list 107

810
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,359
looks like iot

811
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,918
oh there we go i like it except it's uh

812
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,598
that's below 256. we were saying we

813
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,598
could probably get away with that

814
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:03,839
well we'll have to see if 107 is free i

815
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,839
i don't care

816
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
all right uh well let's let's move on in

817
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,919
any case

818
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,359
um we've also added index lists now this

819
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,680
is just an extension

820
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,480
of the original index equals true

821
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,520
semantics

822
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,760
so the idea being that when index

823
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,599
when the the in either the dependency

824
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,079
index or the component index was set to

825
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
true

826
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,560
then it would apply to all components or

827
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,200
dependencies respectively

828
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
uh or each each individual command would

829
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,879
reply

830
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,160
would apply like that uh so this adds a

831
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,119
new semantic

832
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,839
which says uh that you can provide a

833
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,800
list

834
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,440
of indices to which all subsequent

835
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,720
commands

836
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,000
apply this is important

837
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,439
for any device that has more

838
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,440
than two

839
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:59,200
non-identical or non-identically handled

840
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,320
components

841
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,960
so if you can imagine a device where it

842
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,000
has

843
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,400
loadable components then being able to

844
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
say

845
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,400
load all of my components that are

846
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,040
loadable would be useful

847
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,079
given that some of your components will

848
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,200
not be loadable

849
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,200
namely the destinations of those loads

850
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,560
so if you have two components that need

851
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,720
to be loaded into ram

852
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,078
you want to be able to say load my two

853
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,799
components into ram

854
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,200
not load component a load component b

855
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,079
and

856
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,279
the difficulty with the index equals

857
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,160
true semantics

858
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,880
is that the destinations of those loads

859
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,960
would not

860
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,320
themselves be loadable and the commands

861
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,240
would not apply to them

862
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,240
so what this does is gives you the

863
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,759
opportunity to say load component one

864
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,000
load component two

865
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,440
but don't load three and four because

866
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,440
that's where the loads are gonna wind up

867
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,359
um this required a little bit of

868
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,759
thinking through

869
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,920
what it means for the try each and run

870
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,480
sequence

871
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,960
commands and and what that essentially

872
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,400
means

873
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,400
is that we had to properly

874
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,760
document exactly what the semantics are

875
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,280
when you use one of these uh

876
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,280
multi-component indices on one of those

877
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,160
command sequences and what what it means

878
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,599
is that

879
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,118
they shouldn't actually know that that's

880
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,880
what's going on the content of the

881
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,400
command should not be aware of this

882
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,200
instead the command as a whole should be

883
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,960
run once with each possible index

884
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,319
regardless of whether that's the index

885
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
equals true semantics

886
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
or the index equals list semantics they

887
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,280
should only ever

888
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,480
get the numeric indices so that's now

889
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,079
been clearly defined in the document

890
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,400
which should lead to less implementation

891
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:53,280
errors i hope

892
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,280
next slide please

893
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,680
and uh we have removed suit report and

894
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,480
it's been factored into its own draft

895
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,839
which i think we're

896
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,839
coming to very shortly um

897
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,759
so that was just uh yeah okay fine uh

898
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,279
uh all i was gonna say was that it

899
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
didn't have a lot of bearing on the

900
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,040
content of

901
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,960
the suit manifest itself and and so uh

902
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,960
it needed to be in its own draft

903
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,000
um dave thaler gave us a

904
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,520
really substantial review which i don't

905
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,240
know how much time you spent on it but i

906
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,000
tell you

907
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,759
uh going through it and putting those

908
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,839
changes in sure took me a while

909
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,440
uh that so that that's um

910
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,279
that was good review and i think that

911
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,839
the document's substantially better for

912
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
it

913
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,000
um one of my my remaining um

914
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,800
frustrations with this document is that

915
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
it is

916
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,000
enormous and it this is this is

917
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,280
frustrating because it is a relatively

918
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,920
simple concept uh all all we're defining

919
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,119
here is

920
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,800
a bytecode interpreter and the arguments

921
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,359
and and values it takes

922
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,280
or essentially something of that effect

923
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,839
but the the net effect is that when we

924
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,839
get around to describing all of this

925
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,520
mechanic and different that uses

926
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,200
it is up taking a fair bit of space so

927
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,759
anyone knows how to cut that down

928
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,759
let me know

929
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,160
one of the things i've done to try and

930
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,440
aid clarity in the examples

931
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,480
is remove text printing of byte string

932
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,320
wrapped c bore so now there isn't an

933
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,599
enormous quantity of

934
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,920
just hex printed noise in the examples

935
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,880
anywhere that that would have been has

936
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,000
been replaced

937
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,640
with an explicit uh b string dot

938
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,680
seaborg as a as a reference back to the

939
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,440
cddl

940
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,200
um that shows the decoded sebor inside

941
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,200
it with no hex printing around it

942
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,079
uh next slide please i think that might

943
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,680
be the end of it is that the end

944
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,599
yeah that's the end i had uh

945
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,399
two comments so i don't know if there's

946
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,400
any people in queue

947
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,279
it doesn't look like it okay then i'll

948
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,640
go ahead

949
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,480
so i just want to report out to the rest

950
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,319
of the working group that there was a

951
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,319
first that there was a topic that came

952
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,279
up in teep that brennan was there for

953
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,560
and just wanted to

954
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,280
summarize that it had to do with the use

955
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,279
of component ids

956
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,040
and there's another message on the list

957
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
after the meeting that brandon and i and

958
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,240
hannah and folks are in

959
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,880
and the remember teep uses suit and uses

960
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,598
rats

961
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,240
okay so it uses rats for evidence in the

962
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,480
form of

963
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,560
eat tokens and it uses a suit in the

964
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,680
form of suit manifests

965
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,799
both the evidence meaning eat tokens and

966
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,919
suit manifests

967
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,200
have a need to uniquely identify uh

968
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,000
software components the

969
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,879
question was you know right now as as in

970
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,319
that meeting we said

971
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,319
uh the suit manifest uses a component id

972
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,200
which is basically a path of

973
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,079
unique identifiers um and optionally you

974
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,799
can also

975
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,200
use the coswood in the rats working

976
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
group

977
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,439
inside the evidence they don't have one

978
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,839
yet but lawrence has indicated that they

979
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,040
plan to put in coswood

980
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,040
and so the question came up and was

981
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,520
discussed further on the list that says

982
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,839
okay

983
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,759
if you're a constrained device that

984
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,240
wants to implement teep

985
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,319
do you need to implement both coswood

986
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,359
and component ids

987
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,040
or is should we have just one of those

988
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,480
as mandatory more like the suit manifest

989
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,480
does and if we think that say the

990
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,000
component id path is the mandatory one

991
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,720
and coswood is optional

992
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,160
then it might behoove uh the rats

993
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,839
working group to take that into account

994
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,879
when doing eating coding so that was the

995
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,560
summary of that issue

996
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:04,240
right okay my my take on this

997
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,839
um is that suit needs to tell the

998
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,040
manifest processor where to put

999
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,799
something

1000
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,960
exactly you don't have to suit doesn't

1001
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,480
have it there's no choice here

1002
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:18,800
so suit will always have a component id

1003
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,240
correct it may also have a coast wood

1004
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,680
all right and and indeed it may not

1005
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,560
have the coast wood on the end node

1006
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,319
that might have been severed and it

1007
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,200
might be that infrastructure still has

1008
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,560
access to it

1009
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,560
but the end node does not

1010
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,118
my take would be that keeping the

1011
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,359
component id

1012
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,760
in rats is probably necessary anyway

1013
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,400
yes no i think you and i are in

1014
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,079
agreement

1015
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
i think if the rest of working group

1016
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,800
agrees this may be

1017
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,079
a suggestion to the eat authors

1018
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,200
to be able to allow a suit component id

1019
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,920
which you have to use

1020
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,680
anyway as opposed to forcing the use of

1021
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,480
a coswood since they haven't decided yet

1022
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,680
so

1023
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:10,480
well there is another option there which

1024
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,118
is to report the manifest digest itself

1025
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
okay my point is this is really a rat's

1026
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,880
discussion i'm just summarizing it to

1027
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,520
suit because i think brendan and i and

1028
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,200
honest all

1029
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,599
concluded that suit doesn't need any

1030
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,598
changes

1031
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,000
okay uh so that was the first topic and

1032
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,599
the second topic

1033
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,599
i just wanted to tee up because i posted

1034
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,000
it to the list hold on and it hasn't

1035
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,960
been discussed which is the uninstall

1036
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,960
question

1037
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,079
i think we've got hank here who probably

1038
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,880
wants to talk about

1039
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,079
coastwood okay like i said i can't see

1040
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,280
the queue so please

1041
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,280
somebody else manage q and

1042
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,799
go ahead hank okay hi hi this is hank

1043
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,720
um actually i want to talk about

1044
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,680
component id

1045
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,598
so there is a draft actually i don't

1046
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,799
know if it's expired but it's the suit

1047
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,560
claims

1048
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,760
id that uh brent and i

1049
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,759
uh aggregated and there is a system

1050
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,640
property claim in there

1051
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,319
that is actually component id so why

1052
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,598
this is not in the each core

1053
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:14,560
id we most certainly assume that this is

1054
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,800
required

1055
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,680
if you want to express this in evidence

1056
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
and we have

1057
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,680
two sets of claims here that can be used

1058
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,399
in evidence or even at the station

1059
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,319
results

1060
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,839
and these are the system property claims

1061
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,640
and the interpreter

1062
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,759
record claims and so uh i am under the

1063
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,560
impression that this

1064
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,119
is already on the radar uh due to uh

1065
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,920
basically

1066
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,920
as us having it on the radar um i am not

1067
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,640
entirely sure it has if it has to go

1068
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,280
into the car

1069
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,598
each draft it could but it would a

1070
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,200
little bit split one item out and single

1071
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,119
it out and that was a little bit

1072
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,879
confusing to the context maybe

1073
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,560
actually i'm not really worried about

1074
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,520
that we can reference it here

1075
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,920
instead of defining it here uh same same

1076
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,599
so

1077
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,960
it's on the radar i don't think that is

1078
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,960
a issue actually

1079
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,920
so brendan there's a question in chat oh

1080
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,839
i don't know how to answer that question

1081
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,480
um oh sorry can someone remind me what

1082
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,480
sentiment is

1083
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,480
i think it stands for a sensor markup

1084
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,680
language i think it's like a

1085
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,520
batch of values that the way of

1086
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:40,000
expressing a batch of uh

1087
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:43,680
values that uh the

1088
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,720
one of their iot working groups did okay

1089
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,078
um i think it was court i'm

1090
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,078
not sure how that

1091
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,839
i i don't see overlap between that and

1092
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,640
the suit

1093
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,520
right i thought that one of the use

1094
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,440
cases was

1095
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,960
if i have a set of temperature settings

1096
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,960
each taken over

1097
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,800
you know 10 second period over the last

1098
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,800
hour then i can express them all

1099
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,400
in a sentimental format and send them

1100
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,319
off in one message that type of thing i

1101
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
think is an example of a use case

1102
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,839
and again yeah i agree with you i don't

1103
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,839
see the overlap with suits so

1104
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,480
okay uh so so far the the chat seems to

1105
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,200
be agreeing with that

1106
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,560
um okay all right should we ask any

1107
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,040
other questions

1108
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,599
yeah dave you got another question okay

1109
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,520
so

1110
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,520
uh i'll bring this up mainly because

1111
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,880
this is the draft that's overdue and so

1112
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,000
at the expense of stealing a couple

1113
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,760
minutes from the uh

1114
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,119
non-working group documents i think

1115
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,720
that's the right call is

1116
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,480
because we want to be done with this one

1117
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,680
so the message that i posted to the list

1118
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,599
i will summarize

1119
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,319
the draft right now talks about how you

1120
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,000
install uh suit manifest whether that's

1121
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:49,920
installing a component the first time or

1122
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,319
updating an existing opponent

1123
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,040
t has to be able to install update and

1124
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,960
delete

1125
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,079
okay right now the draft doesn't say

1126
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,480
anything about how

1127
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,160
you might go through any type of an

1128
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,119
uninstall procedure

1129
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,640
i think it should um because i would

1130
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,960
like something i could just reference in

1131
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,720
t

1132
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,480
because i can imagine multiple possible

1133
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,680
answers and we should just pick one so

1134
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,760
for example

1135
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,279
uh the examples that i put in there do

1136
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,960
you say in order to delete

1137
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,280
to delete a component you bump the

1138
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,800
manifest version number have no payload

1139
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,160
and put commands in there to delete it

1140
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,200
and so it's another

1141
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,319
uh manifest version of the same

1142
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,960
component

1143
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:29,040
or do you assume that you can use the

1144
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,680
existing one somehow infer what the

1145
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,680
deletion

1146
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,440
structure and commands are based on the

1147
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,078
opposites of the install or something

1148
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,119
else

1149
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,400
and i think the draft should say that's

1150
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,880
that's a fair comment

1151
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,680
um that's going to require a little bit

1152
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,160
of uh

1153
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,879
of thinking through so just to to

1154
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,720
explain

1155
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,079
where the problem lies here uh

1156
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,240
essentially the

1157
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,000
the issue that i see is that um

1158
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,279
there's a dramatically different

1159
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,280
behavior

1160
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,559
depending on whether you've got an

1161
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,960
execute in place

1162
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,559
or or raw flash type device or whether

1163
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,760
you've got a file system device

1164
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,480
and and they act very very differently

1165
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,119
the other thing is that you might not

1166
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,720
actually

1167
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:16,400
want to allow a particular manifest

1168
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,680
to delete a payload of a previous

1169
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,240
version of itself

1170
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,879
because that would that would open the

1171
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,640
door

1172
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,760
to a number of reliability problems

1173
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,359
um so so

1174
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,599
that seems to me like the

1175
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:41,119
the tpu's case is actually orthogonal

1176
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:44,640
to the um to the reliable

1177
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,559
unattended iot device use case and

1178
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,000
that we this is going to take some very

1179
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,280
careful handling to make sure

1180
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,800
that we don't get it wrong yeah i think

1181
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,359
that the use case can come up

1182
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,119
any time that you can have multiple

1183
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,598
independent things installed so like

1184
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,520
multiple

1185
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,280
apps installed for example right it can

1186
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,000
come up not just in a tp use case but

1187
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,559
any time that you

1188
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
can install multiple things supposed to

1189
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,960
say

1190
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,078
one piece of firmware that you're always

1191
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,280
overriding you have to have a piece of

1192
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,480
firmware at a boot right

1193
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
anytime that you can have multiple

1194
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,040
things on top of that this problem can

1195
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,439
come up

1196
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,960
um an example of a complexity and t

1197
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,440
that's very deep specific

1198
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,280
is um antique we used to have this

1199
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,240
notion of security domains right and we

1200
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,359
said well

1201
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,879
that was pushed down to the suit

1202
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,960
manifest if you need to create a

1203
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,359
security domain at the time that you add

1204
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,960
a an app that would depend on it well

1205
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,400
what about if you delete that app you

1206
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,680
delete the security domain or not and

1207
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,599
you might imagine that you want that to

1208
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,680
be configurable somehow and so exactly

1209
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,359
how do you express that and so

1210
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,720
since teep said the install problem we

1211
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,598
were punting over to suit and we're just

1212
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,439
going to reference it

1213
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,760
i would like the teep work now no the

1214
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,960
united stall problem comes too

1215
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,880
yeah okay uh

1216
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,000
you lick the cookie yup i see the uh i

1217
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,200
see the challenge there

1218
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
uh i i understand the use case i'll i'll

1219
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,480
have to i i suspect that the answer is

1220
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,160
that

1221
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,839
much like we've got a way to fetch

1222
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,200
something and to copy something we need

1223
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:07,920
an explicit delete

1224
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,319
uh i suspect that that's the answer uh

1225
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,480
and

1226
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,240
there's a couple of reasons that that's

1227
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,040
important but the thing

1228
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,720
that we definitely need to clarify is

1229
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,480
what is the behavior

1230
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:23,359
if you have multiple copies of something

1231
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,079
so if you've got multiple different

1232
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:27,359
copies

1233
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,119
of the uh of the ta

1234
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,480
and you say delete it but each one has a

1235
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,200
different component id

1236
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,559
right because no see that's the thing uh

1237
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,200
and maybe that's true

1238
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,800
in the teep use case but that's not true

1239
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,480
for all suit devices

1240
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,640
it's fine for me to say the tls library

1241
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,000
and then have that selected based on

1242
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,720
which one's most recent

1243
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,920
and valid and its manifest works and

1244
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,480
then if something

1245
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,079
fails and i need to do a rollback i pick

1246
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,920
the previous

1247
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,319
tls library and and for that to work

1248
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,160
they have to have the same component id

1249
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:02,480
so that becomes a challenge when i now

1250
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,040
say

1251
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,440
delete the tls library which one do i

1252
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,440
delete

1253
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,880
well the same thing comes up i should

1254
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,720
say that in

1255
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,240
teep um when the tip has to be able to

1256
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,000
express the list of things that are

1257
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,240
installed

1258
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,680
and right now in the discussion the teep

1259
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,078
we said we want to do that by component

1260
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,160
id

1261
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,839
now i think that does force teeth to

1262
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,799
always have unique ones and never have

1263
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,880
the collisions

1264
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,040
based on that recommendation that's

1265
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,040
right

1266
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,520
okay so this is something i just want to

1267
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
bring this up i did post it to the list

1268
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,960
yesterday

1269
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,559
but most people haven't seen it but i my

1270
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,359
belief is unless somebody tells me

1271
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,520
otherwise

1272
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,880
in this meeting my belief is we don't

1273
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,160
have to have the answer right now we

1274
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,760
just have to agree that the answer

1275
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,078
should be in the suit manifest document

1276
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,359
before we ship it to isg

1277
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,680
that's that's a fair assessment um i

1278
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,279
will put my thoughts down in an answer

1279
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,960
to that email so that we

1280
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,640
we keep that discussion going and and

1281
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,240
hopefully we can come to a resolution on

1282
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,839
it fairly quickly

1283
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,839
okay sounds good thanks

1284
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:22,319
said it okay

1285
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:25,520
uh to the suit report um

1286
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,880
i saw no one else in queue and i didn't

1287
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,400
see anything else in chat

1288
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,720
so let's go we uh we have

1289
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,160
less than 10 minutes that's okay short

1290
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,160
document short number of slides

1291
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,920
so it would be nice to know what your

1292
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,520
manifest did

1293
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,920
we could use error codes that's what

1294
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,160
most updates do but those often get

1295
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,760
really ambiguous and really badly

1296
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,759
defined that's been my experience

1297
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,880
implementing one of these systems before

1298
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,720
it's it's been

1299
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,559
really hard to actually work out what

1300
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,919
went wrong it'd be nice if you could

1301
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,240
have a back trace

1302
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,839
find out exactly what happened so if

1303
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,078
you've already got a copy of the

1304
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:04,640
manifest what exactly do you need

1305
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,559
to get a back trace of what your

1306
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,839
manifest processor did

1307
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,680
next please well

1308
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,920
there's only a couple of things that

1309
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,960
actually affect the execution path of

1310
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,960
the manifest

1311
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,440
so you'd think that flow control

1312
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,480
commands would affect it

1313
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,200
but they don't only only

1314
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,359
conditions and only if they fail and

1315
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,078
nothing else actually changes the path

1316
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,839
that a manifest

1317
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,839
takes next please

1318
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,400
so what you need to know to be able to

1319
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,640
work out

1320
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,640
exactly what your manifest processor did

1321
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,240
is the digest of the root manifest so

1322
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,118
you've got something to refer to

1323
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,680
the canonical uri so you can fetch the

1324
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,839
full

1325
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,799
set of the manifest regardless if

1326
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:50,160
anything

1327
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,119
of whether or not something's been

1328
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,399
stripped on the end node

1329
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,280
the and then for each condition failure

1330
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,520
you need to know

1331
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,640
which manifest it was processing the

1332
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,480
section that it was

1333
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,640
in how far into that section it was um

1334
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,839
the current manifest oh sorry that

1335
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
should say current component or

1336
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:12,000
dependency

1337
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:14,720
my apologies and the failure reason

1338
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,440
which typically in a condition failure

1339
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,480
would be

1340
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,400
the actual value that didn't match the

1341
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,760
expected

1342
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,400
next slide please um there are a couple

1343
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,040
open issues with this now specifically

1344
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,079
there's

1345
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,640
um the the question

1346
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,319
as to what happens when you've got

1347
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,118
strict order set to false

1348
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,000
and a condition fails that's uh not

1349
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:39,760
exactly clear

1350
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,440
at the moment so need to work through

1351
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,680
that one um

1352
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,359
and then there's a question of whether

1353
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,319
we should add an anti-replay mechanism

1354
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,240
to it

1355
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:51,839
so um that's really it and i believe the

1356
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,879
answer to the anti-replay

1357
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,799
mechanism is yes it should contain some

1358
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,920
kind of

1359
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,000
unique number uh however that works

1360
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,000
whatever that looks like probably a byte

1361
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,040
string

1362
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,880
and uh the

1363
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,160
interrupt question is or is still

1364
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,160
difficult so we'll have to work through

1365
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,960
that one

1366
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,319
there you are as i said short document

1367
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,760
short number of slides

1368
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:24,319
yeah so i believe as chairs

1369
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,799
uh this is a question to dave and russ

1370
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,200
um

1371
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:28,240
should we ask for a call for adoption at

1372
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,558
this point

1373
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,799
um as a data point for the working group

1374
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,440
the teep working group

1375
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:36,960
uh in the past version of the suit

1376
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,119
manifest document that has

1377
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,040
reports in it the teat protocol took a

1378
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,720
dependency on the suit reports and

1379
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,240
referred to that

1380
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,839
and since it was split out the t

1381
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,598
protocol now refers to this document

1382
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,839
which is not a working group document

1383
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,359
but the point is the cheap protocol is

1384
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:53,119
currently taking a dependency on it and

1385
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,799
the hopes that suit would adopt it so

1386
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,000
that is my rationale why i think we

1387
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,400
should go ahead and do a call for

1388
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,400
adoption

1389
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:07,040
i have no objection does anyone um

1390
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,040
in the meeting have an objection

1391
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,440
do you want to do a show of hands tool

1392
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,440
do you just want to call

1393
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,040
ask a question what do you want to do

1394
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:20,319
well does anyone object

1395
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,319
to us starting one and if so why

1396
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:31,680
okay i see support in in chat

1397
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:35,760
and no objection so we'll do that

1398
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:38,879
and i think we have the mud

1399
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,480
uh document next but we only have four

1400
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,599
minutes i don't know how far you can get

1401
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,720
into it

1402
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,720
oh we'll see what we can do

1403
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:48,078
uh trying to find which one is mud

1404
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,680
otherwise i'll re-go and

1405
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,640
start again so so uh just as background

1406
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,680
we've already talked about the mud one

1407
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,879
in ietf 108

1408
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,640
so there's not anything new to report on

1409
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,920
it though this is just a very

1410
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,000
quick overview and um

1411
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,359
hopefully that is helpful so the idea

1412
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,480
here is that we want to deliver some mud

1413
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,040
info and suit

1414
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,839
and to do that we need some new data in

1415
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,040
suit manifests and some new data in eat

1416
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,359
next please uh the the

1417
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,960
changes to suit would mean that we add

1418
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,319
an envelope extension

1419
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:29,440
and specifically that would contain a

1420
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:32,720
mud container and we'd need to add

1421
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,559
a manifest extension to integrity

1422
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,520
protect that mud container

1423
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,240
the mud container itself would have

1424
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,880
either

1425
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,879
a url or a

1426
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,160
digest or a mud file in its entirety now

1427
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,200
the digest

1428
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,640
is of the subject key identifier

1429
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:58,640
of a mud signer

1430
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:01,759
next please the change to eat

1431
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,118
would be that we need to report a

1432
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,319
canonical uri

1433
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,160
for the manifest and

1434
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,240
a digest for the manifest but i think we

1435
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,359
need those already anyway so i'm not

1436
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:16,720
sure there is actually a change there

1437
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:19,040
next please or

1438
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,879
right so the workflow here would be that

1439
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:25,520
a device attests

1440
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:28,079
its manifest digest its manifest uri

1441
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,720
software digest and any configuration

1442
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,720
digests

1443
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,720
then the mud manager would obtain the

1444
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,440
attestation report now i'm assuming that

1445
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,000
that's

1446
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,920
already been verified and it acts as a

1447
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,040
relying party in this case

1448
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,640
um the

1449
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,040
it would then retrieve a canonical

1450
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,040
manifest and validate the authenticity

1451
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,319
of that manifest

1452
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:55,680
uh then it would validate the

1453
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,000
attestation report

1454
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,319
against the contents of the manifest and

1455
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,880
specifically against the coast with

1456
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,759
if it's being used as a software bill of

1457
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,480
materials

1458
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,880
now once that's been done the mud

1459
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,640
manager would have a very confident view

1460
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,880
of exactly what device

1461
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,319
it was looking at and then it can fetch

1462
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,160
and apply a mud file

1463
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,720
with confidence that it is in fact the

1464
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:26,399
correct mud file for the correct device

1465
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,399
and that uh it should apply as expected

1466
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,359
okay we've got less than a minute um so

1467
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,240
and that's i guess the question is do we

1468
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:36,240
want to adopt

1469
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:41,920
uh or start a call for adoption yeah i

1470
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,920
think at 108 the question was what's the

1471
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,000
right working group for this discussion

1472
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,440
and i think we agreed then with roman's

1473
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,359
help that suit was the right working

1474
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:50,880
group for the discussion so

1475
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:52,480
right right i think we also had some

1476
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,000
discussion about whether we

1477
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:57,839
would need to recharter in order to add

1478
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,680
this work item um and i think the

1479
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:04,319
agreement was last time that we would

1480
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,480
okay so we we should start the uh the

1481
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:10,240
discussion of the recharger text

1482
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,240
before we do the call for house

1483
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:16,880
all right we're out of time so um

1484
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,440
go get your virtual cookies and we'll

1485
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,119
see you

1486
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:24,160
at uh in the last session maybe

1487
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,720
um i hope you've enjoyed this virtual

1488
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,839
itf

1489
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,839
thanks everyone

1490
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:43,839
thank you

1491
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,119
uh so dave waltermile you're still on uh

1492
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,720
what did we keep sometime i'm now just

1493
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,400
looking at the chat room since i

1494
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,959
couldn't do that well it's in the screen

1495
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,040
did we have a conclusion on the uh

1496
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,280
stride content on the stride reference

1497
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:16,480
via the chat discussion

1498
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,160
i just want to know whether i still have

1499
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,799
an action item or what's been overtaken

1500
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,799
by reference into a book or something

1501
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:24,240
well i i think i'd propose that we

1502
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,359
reference the

1503
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,640
showstack book um as a

1504
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:32,480
stable reference as i see jennifer is

1505
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,759
saying plus one for stride book is

1506
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,640
source i don't know if that was in

1507
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:39,359
response to

1508
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:43,759
your link i i think it was okay

1509
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,759
um there seems to be support for that

1510
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,240
i have a copy of that book um but it's

1511
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:53,280
unfortunately in my office and i don't

1512
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:55,520
have access to it

1513
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,359
but you're sure this one covers uh

1514
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,480
stride with a title like that i should

1515
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:00,480
but the table of contents

1516
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,400
it does yeah i see it yeah i think

1517
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,640
there's multiple possible books

1518
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,079
uh this one looks fine to me if this is

1519
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,520
one that people are familiar with

1520
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:14,559
it's a wylie and a dr dobbs jolt award

1521
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,759
finalist sure

1522
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,319
this one looks like a fine reference to

1523
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,319
me so then i will uh

1524
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,680
not do my action unless somebody tells

1525
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,480
me otherwise if that's going to be our

1526
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:24,480
default answer so

1527
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,640
i mean separately i will still go and

1528
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,760
get a stable link for it but i don't

1529
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,200
think we need to use it in the suit

1530
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,440
manifest document brennan is just going

1531
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:37,279
to pick this one up so

1532
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,000
i i will take what um what makes sense

1533
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:43,039
and and i i get that isbns are less

1534
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,920
likely to change than urls

1535
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,799
yeah it's just not not as accessible if

1536
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,079
it is not

1537
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:50,319
if it doesn't have a link associated

1538
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,880
with so not as many people can find it

1539
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,680
yeah and that's that's the difficulty um

1540
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,359
so

1541
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:56,879
should we ask on the list whether people

1542
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,558
prefer a uh

1543
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,799
book that you can only pay for or

1544
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:03,839
whether people prefer a non-paid

1545
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:08,000
uh source yeah i mean

1546
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,000
this is the thing it's it's like

1547
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,640
it would be nice if there were a

1548
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,200
reference

1549
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,038
back into the ietf because then then we

1550
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,200
at least can be self-consistent

1551
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,200
um but i think there's any document in

1552
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,078
the ietf that that's referenceable on

1553
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,640
that so

1554
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,160
uh maybe there's an option that says you

1555
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:29,118
could reference both the book

1556
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,319
and the microsoft source which gives you

1557
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,760
at least one

1558
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:38,319
uh paid guaranteed stable thing and one

1559
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,960
uh free um possibly stable reference

1560
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,400
right so

1561
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,839
you can do both yeah okay so so my

1562
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:48,640
my takeaway on that is that regardless

1563
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,839
of which way we end up going it would

1564
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,118
probably be nice

1565
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:55,359
to know what the stable reference was so

1566
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,200
if you're able to pull out that stable

1567
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:59,119
reference that would be great

1568
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,038
um okay so i'll go ahead and do my

1569
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,720
action and send it to you yeah

1570
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,319
even if you choose to do the book in

1571
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,520
addition or whatever but i'll go ahead

1572
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:06,240
and send it to you so i'll still do my

1573
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,960
accent that's what i was trying to

1574
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,720
figure out so

1575
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:10,319
yeah all right well dude thanks guys

1576
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:13,598
thank you well i still have you

1577
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:16,240
um brandon could you draft um a few

1578
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,920
sentences for the charter text on

1579
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,359
uh or at least to propose some charter

1580
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,940
text for the

1581
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:27,650
the suit report and and suit mud

1582
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,650
[Laughter]

1583
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,400
my interpretation is the and so i don't

1584
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,759
know if roman is still on

1585
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,920
uh he may have dropped off i think he

1586
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,039
was on here earlier let me check

1587
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:41,200
yeah roman is still on um the

1588
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,319
at the discussion of having to reach

1589
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,038
harder

1590
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:46,960
uh my recollection is really fuzzy but i

1591
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,720
think that did apply to the mud document

1592
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,319
but did it apply to the report which was

1593
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,319
already in the suit manifest before

1594
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,440
well i i think i would see no harm if

1595
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,599
we're going to go through the

1596
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,799
rechartering process to at least add

1597
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,039
work items for

1598
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:02,720
for both no it's just a sequencing

1599
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,319
question can we start doing the call for

1600
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,118
adoption

1601
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:09,599
and the uh recharter discussion in

1602
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:13,440
parallel or do we need to serialize them

1603
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:17,680
if i remember right the the charter text

1604
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:21,680
says that we will produce a

1605
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:24,000
uh a serialization for a manifest format

1606
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,240
i think that is the only actual

1607
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,359
normative

1608
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,118
information in the charter text which

1609
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:34,000
probably means that we can't do suit

1610
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,559
report without a recharter

1611
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,039
okay so it only matters well not only

1612
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:38,880
but

1613
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,079
it matters to the teep working group

1614
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,760
because they'll have a normative

1615
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,319
dependency on the suit report which

1616
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,640
means t

1617
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:45,759
protocol can't go to rfc any sooner than

1618
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,038
the suit report does

1619
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,640
yeah and if it's blocked behind a

1620
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:50,079
recharger effort then that adds delays

1621
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,160
in the suit into the tea protocol which

1622
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,480
may or may not be an issue so

1623
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,480
well this this is the the point where i

1624
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,559
think i i would ask our area director

1625
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:00,480
what to do

1626
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:02,160
yeah that's why i was looking roman is

1627
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,799
on but he's this is jabra user so maybe

1628
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,839
he's only seeing text

1629
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,799
well i think we're going to have to

1630
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,400
reach out to roman and ask his advice

1631
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,200
yeah we can follow up with him offline

1632
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:17,039
okay okay thanks everybody

1633
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,839
all right great folks thank you

1634
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,839
bye
