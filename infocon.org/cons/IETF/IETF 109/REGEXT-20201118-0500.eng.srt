00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,079
notewell we just discussed

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,319
and um

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,080
we have always a steady item on our

43
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,958
agenda which is document management and

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
special attention to document shepherds

45
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,760
we wish to thank everybody that

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,319
volunteers to be a document shepherd

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
as you are all aware we are a small

48
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,119
working group and we have the process

49
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
where we

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
choose our document shepherds early in

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
the process meaning that

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
if you want to have a document adopted

53
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,200
we

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
ask you to look around in this working

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,319
group for volunteers to be a document

56
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,799
shepherds

57
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,079
the work of a document chapter is mostly

58
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,480
procedural

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,280
meaning that even though you don't know

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,119
any

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
very deep technical details of over

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
certain draft

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,800
you will be asked to guide that draft

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,440
through our working group

65
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
and it is a very good opportunity for

66
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,760
newcomers in the

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:21,280
working group to learn about the idf

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,280
procedures and processes

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,879
and i think that since we are doing that

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
uh

71
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,399
early on in the process it works very

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
well and so

73
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,480
a thank you to everybody who volunteers

74
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,480
to be a document shepherds

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,159
and of course the chairs will always

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,319
guide people that want to become a

77
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,000
document shepard so don't worry if you

78
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,238
don't understand anything about the

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,840
procedures yet

80
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,840
next slide please jim

81
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,480

82
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,319

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,760
we produced next slide

84
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,359
so we published one document since the

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,840
last itf meeting

86
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,280
which is the logan security extensions

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,879

89
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,079
and um well thank you for everybody we

90
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,358

91
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,919
we have got some work done next slide

92
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,918
please jim

93
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,518
status next

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,280
so these are documents which are passed

95
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,719
our working group last call a short

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,039
summary of the status of most of them

97
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
the registry data escrow specification

98
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,840
and the domain name

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
registration data objects mapping

100
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,440
documents

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,520
i want to discuss those uh both at the

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
same time because they sort of like go

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,000
together

104
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,960
and while the data escrow

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,960
document is already in old 48 state at

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,080
the rc editor

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:05,120
there's still a discuss on the

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,800
dnrd objects mapping document

109
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,039
and we're in the process with the iesg

110
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120
and the document authors to get that

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,560
resolved so that they can be published

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
together so

113
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,080
yes uh filling that in no actually uh

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:27,680
friday the rfc editor published rfc 8909

115
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,919
okay uh so we i sent a note to them

116
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
today at you guys request to try to get

117
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
them to hold off publication until

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,919
object mapping was ready

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
but it turns out they had already

120
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,000
published it a few days ago

121
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,639
okay so the authors also didn't take

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,199
that into account

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,039
yeah it's all right okay i don't think

124
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,720
it will be a big problem

125
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
anybody who reads it right now it won't

126
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
make much sense to them until object

127
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,039
mapping is out but

128
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,919
it's fine yeah okay yeah well they did

129
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,240
they didn't need

130
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:03,680
any consecutive uh rfc numbers i believe

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
so that won't be a problem okay thank

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
you

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,199
i think that was barry

134
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,198
i should have said barry lieber

135
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,160
then the i can trademark clearinghouse

136
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,600
functional specification

137
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,120
last itf meeting we decided that this

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,720
document is going to the

139
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,080
independent stream process

140
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,080
and very

141
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,119
generously uh wanted to have a

142
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
discussion with the document authors

143
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,800
which is

144
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
gustavo um this is the last time we will

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
put this on the agenda it's

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
of our milestone list i think everything

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,120
that the working group needed to do

148
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,479
here in um

149
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,360
helping with this document uh has been

150
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
done

151
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,319
so uh if there if anybody still has any

152
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,199

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
it is submitted to the isg and we're

175
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,080
waiting for their feedback

176
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,719
right so um i believe

177
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
the both of them have no discusses on

178
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
them

179
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
i just uh i'm waiting for the shepherds

180
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,840
to let me know whether the

181
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
whether the versions that are current

182
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,159
are ready to go

183
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,318
so if you guys think that sorting and

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,800
paging and partial response

185
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,680
are ready i will give them a final check

186
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and do the approval

187
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,080
yes because this document came back to

188
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,080
the working group

189
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,080
mostly for language issues right um

190
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
which we corrected with the help of

191
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,439

199
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,479
apart from being

200
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
apart from having the shepherd tell me

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,000
something i think it's in my

202
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,040
actions so i need to know what action

203

we're very grateful about that and

213
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,399
basically this is just a

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,800
action waiting for me but in the week

215
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,800
before the itf i had little

216
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:43,199
time to do the submission and probably

217
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
the 80s are busy during the itf week as

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
well

219
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,200
so this will be submitted this week or

220
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,839
at least

221
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,839
at the beginning of the next week

222
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
any questions about those

223
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:04,000
no and then we have two

224
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,560
documents that um

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
are waiting for the shepherd write-ups

226
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,479
which is the secured info

227
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,920
transfer and the epp unhandled

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
namespaces

229
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,760
um waiting for the shepherds to do their

230
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
write-ups

231
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,920
uh one comment and or one question i

232
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,279
have to ask about

233
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,560
these last four documents actually

234
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,200
because for three of these documents we

235
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,800
had to

236
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,040
extend the working group last call

237
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,120
now the question that i have is

238
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
is our we are a small working group we

239
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,040
realize that

240
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,000
is our working group last call window of

241
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,360
two weeks too

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,839
small or is this just a coincidence

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,240
and these documents needed to have some

244
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,240
further

245
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,839
time to to to adjust the documentation

246
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,880
it's just a remark for me uh or but

247
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,880
it's i just noticed that you know for

248
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,519
the past documents we always had to

249
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
um extend the working group last call

250
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,760
for these documents that was not an

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,800
issue

252
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,160
but if it's a process issue from the

253
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
chairs

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
then we would like to hear

255
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,720
and he remarks about those

256
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,720
if not then we will continue

257
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,719
you have something to say jim actually i

258
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,959
have a comment

259
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,959
okay

260
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,920
uh yeah i i just think it's uh natural i

261
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
think uh

262
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,719
for uh a couple of these they were just

263
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,320
late detailed feedback that came back um

264
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,160
from the working group that needed to be

265
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,120
worked out um

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,719
so i don't think that they need to be

267
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,279
extended from two weeks to three weeks

268
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
or some

269
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
longer period of time um but i also

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,959
wanted to point out one

271
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,720
additional item on the unhandled name

272
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,518
spaces is that

273
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,959
i did make an update based on the

274
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
working group last call and i'm

275
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,439
encouraging the working group to take a

276
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,320
look at

277
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,200
those updates specifically in adding the

278
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,720
implementation

279
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
considerations section based on feedback

280
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
from

281
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,360
thomas court so

282
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,880
um as as you're looking at these please

283
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,880
take a look at that uh that update

284
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,680
thank you okay thank you jim

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,439
well you and as a remark back you know

286
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,599
it could also be that we are

287
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,720
calling out the working group last call

288
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,120
too early right uh when there has not

289
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
been

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,200
enough uh review being done uh

291
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,120
during the normal working group time

292
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,200
that we have for the documents

293
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
and it could also be that that's why we

294
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
get a lot of remarks that still have to

295
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,599
be

296
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,599
implemented in the document during the

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,360
working group last call

298
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,120
so actually this is um a question for me

299
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
uh to everybody in the working group

300
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
that to

301
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,959
to please review documents um

302
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,200
before we um we put them into working

303
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,599
good plus calls

304
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,839
okay thank you then next slide please

305
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,839
jim

306
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,839
and this is where you take over from me

307
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
okay thanks uh antoine and this is uh

308
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,079
the the last comment

309
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,079
and discussion is kind of a nice segue

310
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,000
into this particular document

311
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,839
um it unfortunately um found itself in a

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,519
in a place where we had some interesting

313
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,560
discussion during the working group last

314
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,040
call

315
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,638
that um again we've said a few times we

316
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,959
know we're a small group

317
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,040
and you know when you end up with just

318
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,119
two people who are having a discussion

319
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
we really wanted to try and get some

320
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,639
additional input

321
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,599
and uh we guess we didn't spark enough

322
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,199
interest

323
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
so in this particular case although we

324
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,560
tried to extend the working group last

325
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
call we ended up just closing it and

326
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,959
pulling the document back into the

327
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
working group

328
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,319
so that we could finish that discussion

329
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,719
on the document

330
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,480
um now jody i noticed your hand go up

331
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560
and then you pulled it away

332
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,720
i'm happy to let you jump in and say

333
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,160
something if you want

334
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
other than that you know the comment

335
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,839
from the chairs on this document

336
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
is we just need to finish that

337
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,399
discussion

338
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,560
um it was uh jody and and uh

339
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,560
jim gold in particular that were having

340
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,599
a little bit of a back and forth on some

341
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,800
comments

342
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,720
um and uh you know that nothing nothing

343
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,399
came of that it just sort of ended there

344
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,279
when we asked for other input

345
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,199
so this is an appeal to the group please

346
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,720
go back check out that thread

347
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,479
and add to it so that we can figure out

348
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,680
what the consensus is on this document

349
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
and then we'll

350
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,920
move it back into a last call and and

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,079
push it forward

352
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,040
so uh last chance any comments from

353
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,920
anyone about that

354
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,160
status of that document uh jim gool go

355
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,279
ahead please

356
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,360
about uh about doing late feedback i

357
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,279
apologize the working group um

358
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,519
when the working group last call came up

359
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,639
i decided to do a deep dive on this

360
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,519
particular

361
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,040
draft so that's the result of the deep

362
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,399
dive

363
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,240
but yeah i encourage others in the

364
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
working group to also do

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
that kind of deep dive earlier in the

366
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,600
process if possible

367
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,040
yeah thanks jim no worries um you know

368
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,360
uh the fact that you did

369
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,439
comment and looked into it is certainly

370
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,199
the most welcome part of all of that

371
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,000
um you know timing timing is just

372
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,519
whatever it is it's

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,759
fine so okay uh rick wilhelm go ahead

374
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,720
please

375
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,880
thanks can you hear me okay yes very

376
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,000
good rick wilhelm uh heard the record

377
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,199
um on this particular one i

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
also uh have had a uh some separate

379
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,599
conversations

380
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,399
um with some folks on the that i would

381
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
say are

382
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,680
approaching this a little bit more from

383
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,319
the business side not just the technical

384
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
side

385
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
and i'm gonna be gonna i'm not i'll

386
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,320
either do this

387
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
on my own or with with gould but but put

388
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
in some comments

389
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,120
uh here one of the things that that i'll

390
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,119
bring up

391
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
just to to not have there been any

392
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
suspense about it

393
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,800
is that these maintenance notifications

394
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,680
um have a uh a contractual

395
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,880
have at times a contractual need to be

396
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,920
accomplished

397
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,920
and there are uh

398
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
different ways in which notifications

399
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,360
can be sent

400
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,880
either email as folks know or now of

401
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
course we're considering doing this by

402
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,320
epp

403
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,479
and so it when it comes to

404
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,319
this perhaps fulfilling a contractual

405
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
need i think that we'll

406
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,760
need to discuss if it does that just due

407
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,839
to the way that the

408
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,599
the maintenance notification process

409
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,480
would work via the pull queue

410
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,760
uh because if a registry is notifying

411
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,880
another party

412
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,559
uh by the poll queue it's it's unclear

413
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,799
exactly when

414
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:28,079
that is going to uh if that's going to

415
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,320
satisfy the the uh

416
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,320
business requirement also so i think

417
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,918
that's something that we'll need to

418
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,760
i'll try and work to bring that up in a

419
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
comment i just want to

420
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,640
state it here to give a little bit of a

421
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,639
preview uh thank you

422
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,520
thanks for that rick um i'll uh

423
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
channel antoine a little bit here and

424
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,799
just you know make a comment for us

425
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,360
antoine and i often have this discussion

426
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,679
about um

427
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,959
you know i i can requirements or not i

428
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,480
can requirements

429
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,080
we do need to be a little careful just

430
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,919
to keep separate any policy

431
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,879
considerations from uh

432
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,440
technical considerations um uh that kind

433
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
of thing

434
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
i mean i do appreciate what you're what

435
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,720
you're after here you know poll messages

436
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,039
are handed very differently

437
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,960
uh typically asynchronously from the

438
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
synchronous communication that our

439
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
policies typically require but we should

440
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
certainly examine whether or not that's

441
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,679
an issue for this

442
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,480
uh this specification or not um

443
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,480
so thanks for that

444
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,639
okay moving on

445
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,880
uh let's move into existing work

446
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,679
presentations uh we actually have quite

447
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
a lot

448
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,320
that we have now moved on from and and

449
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,120
passed along so yay for us

450
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,399
uh pretty uh pretty awesome uh uh

451
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,399
success uh for us

452
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,640
this year um in spite of uh the uh

453
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,080
world pandemic and our virtual nature

454
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
that we have here going

455
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,520
so we have two presentations set up for

456
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,639
today um

457
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,280
the rdap reverse search capabilities

458
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,880
um searches is certainly uh important

459
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,200
stuff in rdap

460
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,440
for a variety of reasons and this work

461
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,120
has been languishing for a long time

462
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,960
but mario i believe you're ready to um

463
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,159
step up and help us try to invigorate

464
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,600
this work a bit

okay thank you this is a

473
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,520
very short presentation about the status

474
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,000
of research

475
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,840
reverse search in our dup draft

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
please go to the next slide

477
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:57,120
the first slide about this changes

478
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,480
most relevant changes made since last

479
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,520
meeting i

480
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,120
reorganized the abstract to

481
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,559
in order to rearrange the content to

482
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,879
consider reverse search

483
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,559
not only based on the domain entity

484
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
relationship

485
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:17,520
and i added two section

486
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,639
to define the are the conformance value

487
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,200
reverse search

488
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,120
to signal conformance with this

489
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,000
specification as

490
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:31,039
suggested by scott

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,760
in the working group mailing list

492
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:40,320
next slide please

493
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:43,360
the the other two slides

494
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,879
are about the evolution of

495
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:51,120
regulatory context of registry data

496
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,120
and i put this slide to

497
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:01,840
inform the working group

498
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,840
about the direction

499
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,280
towards which the european european

500
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,719
union is moving

501
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,200
about the provisioning of am

502
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:21,280
public with data registry data

503
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,559
the first uh proposal uh uh made by

504
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,600
the european union is the e-evidence the

505
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,639
electronic

506
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,559
evidence the goal is to make it easier

507
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,760
and faster for police and judicial

508
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,918
authorities like europol europol

509
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,480
to access the electronic evidence so

510
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,960
the authorities should be able to access

511
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,400
some public registry data without

512
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,000
submitting

513
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,120
written requests and this proposal

514
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,240
were called to become a

515
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,678
european union directivo

516
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,480
at the end of this year but is expected

517
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,880
to become

518
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,400
european in union directive or

519
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,480
regulation

520
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,480
uh i think

521
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,039
the the next year

522
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,760
uh next day next slide please this is

523
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,280
the last

524
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,320
slide another example of

525
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,760
how the european union registries

526
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,799
are moving to provide access to on

527
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,480
public data

528
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,720
is the cooperation between national

529
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,039
authorities

530
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,039
and chant registries

531
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,600
authorities normally request regis

532
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,678
to access some public registrar data for

533
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,678
legitimate interest

534
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,880
and the recuperation agreement and

535
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
registry

536
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
should provide authorities with fast

537
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,120
access to

538
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,480
those data so some

539
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,199
national regulations are currently being

540
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,919
reviewed to meet this requirement

541
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,559
uh the the the goal of these two

542
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,320
proposals is to

543
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:15,120
is to provide

544
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,158
authorities with fast access and

545
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,399
authenticated

546
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:24,799
access to registered data through

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,799
uh obviously uh

548
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,440
registered data discovery services so uh

549
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,880
i think that this

550
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:40,320
proposal goes in the same direction uh

551
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,760
of the goal uh of the

552
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,559
reverse search uh draft so uh i think

553
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,320
that uh

554
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,840
rivet sasha is furtherly justified

555
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,080
by the the the evolution and the

556
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,799
progress of this proposal

557
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:05,840
uh at least within the european union uh

558
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,840
countries that's it

559
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
okay thanks mario appreciate very much

560
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,279
you uh

561
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,559
stepping in to uh bring this work back

562
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,840
forward again

563
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,399
uh one general comment from me um

564
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,959
you know i i think that uh being able to

565
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,320
search in

566
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,480
in our gap is is a pretty significant um

567
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,240
feature that uh we do need to understand

568
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,840
you know how to make that how to set

569
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,760
that up to to make that happen

570
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,360
the rdap spec certainly has some

571
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,320
indications of searching

572
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,000
but i think a more full and complete

573
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
specification for how to do that

574
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,520
is really is what's what's needed within

575
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,360
rdap

576
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,360
i'd like to encourage folks here to

577
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,559
please get involved in this discussion

578
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,039
especially those of us who are involved

579
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,760
uh you know on the icann side there's a

580
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,600
lot of work going on on the icann side

581
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,120
with respect to whether or not search

582
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,080
should be present or not and what that

583
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,399
means

584
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,320
so it'd be very good to have a technical

585
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
understanding of what's possible

586
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,158
so that we can continue that discussion

587
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,840
on that side

588
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,559
and with that uh scotch have your hand

589
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,559
up go ahead please

590
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,600
uh thanks jim scott hollenbeck here um

591
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,559
i'm generally not a fan of reverse

592
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,399
search because i think

593
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,639
you know there are some very significant

594
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,679
privacy concerns associated with

595
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,480
this kind of capability however as

596
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
we've discussed in chat given

597
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,400
appropriate

598
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,120
access control client identification

599
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,120
client authorization capabilities

600
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,479
i i think those kinds of concerns can be

601
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,479
mitigated and so i think what i'm going

602
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,400
to suggest is that um

603
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,400
you know i've been sitting on my

604
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
federated authentication draft for a bit

605
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,960
primarily because of

606
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,039
of a lack of progress in the icann space

607
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,360
that jim was just describing

608
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,080
um but if we have a use case here for

609
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,240
which

610
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,158
that kind of technology you know could

611
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,440
be very useful

612
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,720
um this may be the one that

613
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,799
that we use to kind of move that

614
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,760
document forward at the same time

615
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,760
so just a thought

616
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,799
thank you scott um and of course as you

617
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,279
know

618
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,279
um you know documents nowadays have a

619
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,600
spot and we talked about this before

620
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,080
in the in this working group um although

621
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,360
we never came to any conclusion about it

622
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,120
but there is an opportunity for a

623
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,199
privacy consideration section

624
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,879
in a document and and that would be

625
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,480
something that you know we should just

626
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,279
consider how to fill that out in this

627
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
document

628
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,960
that becomes one of the more important

629
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,679
elements that uh maybe if we can

630
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,480
can cover that um we can cover this

631
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,640
issue

632
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,400
uh and then as you say i like the idea

633
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,880
that maybe it's it's the motivation to

634
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,440
bring the open id stuff forward

635
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,559
um i want to see if i mean i guess mario

636
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
went away i don't know if you want to

637
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,158
add any comments in here mario

638
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,240
but alex have your hand up for now go

639
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,960
ahead

640
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,240
uh thank you no other comments for me

641
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,440
thank you mario um the

642
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,039
the one point i want to spell out is

643
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,600
we're currently working on implementing

644
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,720
an rdap uh prototype 4.80

645
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,000
and what i'm using now is uh uh

646
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,360
plain chain word tokens so it's not full

647
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,120
blown open id

648
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
but i certainly know that we need some

649
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,840
kind of

650
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,399
scalable authorization infrastructure if

651
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,639
we

652
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,840
give that to third parties let me put it

653
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,840
that way very carefully

654
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,399
okay thank you alex

655
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
ulrich go ahead please

656
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,840
ulric if you're speaking well there you

657
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,039
go

658
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,639
uh yeah i just want this is oldish from

659
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,799
this british registry um

660
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
i wanted to say that mario has actually

661
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,960
done the privacy consideration

662
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,120
part and because we have had this

663
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,520
discussion here in the group quite often

664
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,959
uh and i think so the document has

665
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,080
improved from that part

666
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,760
uh i would actually ask how do we know

667
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,279
that this is a

668
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,279
good privacy consideration

669
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,279
is there any other group that we could

670
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,199
ask i mean if we would say

671
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,399
for security if we would do some

672
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,720
encryption we would

673
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,158
probably ask the crypto forum or the

674
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,600
security

675
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,000
uh some security group to

676
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,959
take a look so how do we do this with

677
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,760
privacy

678
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
considerations

679
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,960
so thank you for that question ulric um

680
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,000
i wonder if maybe we can put our ad on

681
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,720
the spot here

682
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,720
and ask i i have to say that i don't

683
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,799
think that i've seen any significant

684
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,919
privacy consideration section at least

685
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,760
myself

686
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,440
uh in in having looked through documents

687
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
nothing that's crossed my

688
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,159
desk if you will have one

689
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,200
in june um yeah yeah the human rights

690
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,799
protection group that

691
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,840
um had its original comments for these

692
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,240
documents

693
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,480
um they were the ones that opposed this

694
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,039
document because

695
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,399
a lot of privacy considerations

696
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,919
obstacles

697
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,199
for this document now their work was

698
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
mostly about

699
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,960
trying to get this document not not

700
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,440
published

701
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,600
because they didn't like the idea at all

702
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,039
where we asked them that they could help

703
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,918
write a sufficient privacy

704
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,960
considerations

705
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,640
section um so we i think i guess we can

706
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,679
ask them again

707
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,559
to review the privacy considerations

708
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,480
section while you know the what the

709
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,799
document for the rest describes is

710
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,039
actually how to do reverse search and

711
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,879
not when to do research search

712
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
and just that comment on privacy

713
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,720
considerations sections

714
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
uh so there wasn't there was an iab

715
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,279
document some years ago

716
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:10,480
that discussed privacy issues and

717
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,919
recommended that if that that you might

718
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,600
include a privately considerate

719
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,000
infection if there were significant

720
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,080
privacy issues that needed to be covered

721
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,320
there's no requirement to have a privacy

722
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,639
consideration section and most documents

723
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,399
as

724
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,080
jim noted don't but if a lot of issues

725
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,959
have been raised it would be good to

726
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,879
have a

727
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
good privacy consideration section that

728
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,159
they can review

729
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,399
so yeah i think the best answer is to go

730
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,559
back to them

731
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,918
discuss the issues again and decide what

732
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,918
to say in the document

733
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,000
you're probably not going to make them

734
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,799
happy but at least if the issues that

735
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,559
were raised

736
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:53,840
are documented and addressed

737
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,840
the iesg is not likely to balk

738
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,159
thank you thank you for that barry and i

739
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,679
want to call out in the chat

740
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,919
um ali hussain had um noted the internet

741
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,799
draft from the hrpc

742
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,399
some guidelines from them so that should

743
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,600
be something we should also

744
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,239
make a point of checking out carefully

745
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,519
to try and move this document along as

746
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,159
antoine said we had quite some

747
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,440
discussion

748
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,399
from the human rights folks uh early on

749
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,360
and um yeah maybe we just we just have

750
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
to press on that

751
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,719
and and draw a consensus from our group

752
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,639
here

753
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,080
and do the best we can to simply address

754
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,159
the concerns

755
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,760
uh let's see oreck i think that's an old

756
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,760
hand so alex go ahead please

757
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,960
yes thank you i mean

758
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,279
obviously reverse search is very privacy

759
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,039
sensitive and and we all know that

760
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,200
even though we are just engineers so to

761
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,399
say uh we have a strong

762
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,480
privacy understanding i would say so

763
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,479
but on the other hand as as you said

764
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,600
this is a technical specification

765
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,279
so um i think that that we should point

766
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,439
out that there are significant privacy

767
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,320
implications on providing research

768
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,679
reverse search yes but but i believe

769
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,720
that there is no need to say in a

770
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
technical document

771
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,399
not follow the law because that's quite

772
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,440
obvious um

773
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,518
and and what we could say is maybe that

774
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,200
yeah this is this is obviously highly

775
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,640
privacy relevant and

776
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,399
implementers must yeah

777
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,559
but must consider uh legal implications

778
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,080
yeah as easy as that and then must

779
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,440
follow the local

780
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,279
um law

781
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,919
i i mean i do believe that

782
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,960
we can't we can't fix any problems that

783
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,640
the lawmakers

784
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:48,559
have have introduced in those directions

785
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,320
um but it would be at the minimum

786
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,480
as engineers we should say that hey we

787
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,960
got concerns here this is a sensitive

788
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,880
topic

789
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,720
you must address this before you

790
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,039
actually put out your registration data

791
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,480
on the internet

792
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,080
i don't know whether that's inclined

793
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,519
with the irb document that barry

794
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,559
mentioned before

795
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,799
um but but i think that would be

796
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,000
sort of like sort of like a generic

797
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,000
strategy to interstates

798
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,640
thank you alex um

799
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,719
you know in terms of being in line with

800
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
the iab document you know what i what i

801
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,880
heard

802
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,959
from from barry i think you know

803
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,679
probably the the most important guidance

804
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,679
for us is whatever questions are raised

805
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,760
um we should just speak to them the

806
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,080
privacy considerations section

807
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,000
should at least say something about the

808
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,559
questions that are being raised

809
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,880
by the human rights folks um and that

810
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,960
might be the best that we can do

811
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,240
and and you know that's that's the path

812
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,880
that we should look for

813
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,399
and of course make sure that we are uh

814
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,440
completing anything that might be in the

815
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,399
iab document

816
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,880
so okay uh ulrich you're going to get

817
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,959
the last word here go ahead please

818
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,200
okay uh yes of course there's

819
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
i think we discussed this a few meetings

820
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,120
back that

821
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,679
just saying follow the law isn't enough

822
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,159
and

823
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,440
mario fixed it in the document because i

824
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,919
think what we should

825
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,800
point out is where are the privacy

826
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,960
problems

827
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
because not every reverse surge is a

828
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,079
privacy problem

829
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,440
but specific versions of reverse search

830
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,800
are privacy problems

831
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,119
and if we point out these problems and

832
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,639
people have some pointers of where to

833
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,320
start investigating what they

834
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,839
should do and can do and i think that is

835
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,839
what is asked of us

836
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,799
so thank you for that ulric i like that

837
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,359
um it would probably be especially

838
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,679
helpful

839
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,440
if you would um you know take a look at

840
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,399
the document and what's there and

841
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,800
and bring that comment and that question

842
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,118
uh

843
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
to bear on your review of the document

844
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,280
and and say something on the mailing

845
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,598
list about that

846
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,040
that would be very helpful to us um i

847
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,800
agree with you

848
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,040
so okay with that um i think we're

849
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,960
a little bit behind schedule here uh not

850
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,560
a lot we do have a few minutes at the

851
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,400
end so we're okay

852
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,799
let's move on to our next presentation

853
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,160
here simple registration reporting

854
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
uh joseph you are out there do you want

855
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,279
to jump in here

856
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,279
let me bring your slides up for you

857
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,040
thanks gene can you hear me well

858
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,480
yes perfectly go ahead please awesome i

859
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,800
still remember my last uh

860
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,480
last time okay

861
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,560
thanks everyone this is the simple

862
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,280
registration reporting this is about

863
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,240
the the standardized set of report that

864
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,280
registry

865
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,319
can provide for registrar so that we

866
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,520
we have a consistent expectations of

867
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,560
what being produced

868
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,200
and and how registered consume

869
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
next slide

870
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,839
not well no not well thanks

871
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,960
uh the draft status was discussed in

872
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:08,799
last ietf and being about and the latest

873
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,800
version version o2

874
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,839
was recently submitted was recently

875
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,560
published at november 2nd

876
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,320
that one is mainly focused on expanding

877
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,680
the inr registries

878
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:27,839
on how to register the the fields

879
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,839
and the reports definitions next slide

880
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,599
we still have to open questions from the

881
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,680
last versions mainly about

882
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,000
the the column headings whether they can

883
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,200
be ignored

884
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,079
and and and and

885
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,279
if we are now the unrecognized column

886
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,839
headers

887
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,160
can be in part of the report uh next

888
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,160
slide

889
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,880
and and this one is using one of the

890
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,920
report to demonstrate

891
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
whether one of the

892
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,680
uh the fields can be mandatory or

893
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,720
or optional this is also the discussion

894
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,399
we have from the last

895
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,399
version as well next

896
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,760
okay so i just actually just talked

897
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,959
about this uh what are the

898
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,880
the columns and and also

899
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:29,040
um this list of the current reports

900
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,680
in the uh the draft been um

901
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,079
documented and there's open questions of

902
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,078
whether

903
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,839
there be more reports we need to add to

904
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,560
it

905
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,960
next uh jim you have james you have

906
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
questions

907
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:53,040
oh wow jim cool go ahead please

908
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,720
you hear me can you hear me yes okay

909
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,000
good thank you thank you

910
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,000
uh yeah actually i'm i kind of reverse

911
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,599
what your question is actually i'd like

912
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,880
to see less reports

913
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,400
um in the draft um because i like the

914
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,960
draft to be focused

915
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,040
on the framework and not on the actual

916
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,920
concrete reports

917
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
so if you wanted to find in a registry

918
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,440
around the fields

919
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,560
and the reports in the process for

920
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,680
updating

921
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
diana registry that's that's fine so

922
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,440
that'd be focused

923
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,359
on the framework but the specific

924
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,720
reports i think will be very difficult

925
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,680
to get consensus on

926
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,359
and that gets my second feedback on them

927
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
is the track of this draft because right

928
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,078
now i guess it's defined as

929
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,960
informational

930
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,200
um i'm not sure it's because of the fact

931
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,880
that it has concrete reports

932
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,640
or is there another reason why it's not

933
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,839
standards track

934
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
so thank you

935
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,880
okay uh

936
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,680
we can actually bring that to this to

937
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,279
working group if we want to

938
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,799
talk more about the uh

939
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,800
splitting the framework but

940
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,760
so i don't have the answer i would love

941
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
to actually get more feedback from the

942
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,800
working group on that

943
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,680
so let me add one quick comment as uh

944
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,359
as a co-author here with joseph i think

945
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,040
that structurally if you want to put

946
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,160
this into two documents where the

947
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,560
framework is won

948
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,000
and and the initial document

949
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,160
specification

950
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,599
if the issue report specification is a

951
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,640
separate document

952
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,920
um you know i think that would um

953
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,720
that seems fine to me um if anybody has

954
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,720
any

955
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,799
objections to that be good to to hear

956
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,720
that that'd be something to think about

957
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,839
i think that's a one response to jim

958
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,160
gould's thing

959
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,078
um more directly to the question of uh

960
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,839
the status of this document

961
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,440
um actually that would be a question at

962
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,319
the end of this this thing

963
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,280
um you know i i do actually i agree with

964
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,440
you jim gool

965
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,200
you didn't actually say this but um

966
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,720
speaking for myself

967
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,480
i was actually thinking this document

968
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,759
should go to standards track

969
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,760
certainly the framework should be

970
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,960
standards track um

971
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,560
the actual reports maybe not so maybe

972
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,319
that's another reason for splitting the

973
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,680
document

974
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,119
i think that it was just uh an artifact

975
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,960
of how we started

976
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,040
that we made it informational to start

977
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,480
with um but i think a fair question at

978
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,000
the end of this presentation for the

979
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,720
working group to think about

980
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,400
is confirming that um it would be good

981
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,200
to move this to standard track at least

982
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,960
the framework

983
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,560
so that's an open question interested in

984
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,319
hearing from folks

985
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,720
um with that alex have your hand up go

986
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,319
ahead please

987
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,759
thank you jim um

988
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,759
there was one question to draft about

989
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,960
the empty values i think that uh that's

990
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,440
the problem of the

991
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,359
of the output format for quite

992
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,560
concretely first years we i would like

993
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,078
to see empty columns

994
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,680
yeah for other formats that we might be

995
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,079
waiting in the future like

996
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,480
whatever um there are formats for that

997
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,800
in in the in the data format itself

998
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,480
on the second part i agree with what

999
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,640
what you jim's have said

1000
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,720
um i think that having too many reports

1001
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,560
in the original framework draft would

1002
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,598
complicate the process let me put it

1003
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,680
that way

1004
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,880
um and i also agree that the framework

1005
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,520
itself

1006
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,520
um should probably be standard strike

1007
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,280
and then we we are pretty free to define

1008
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,480
whatever reports we have an

1009
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,240
informational document

1010
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,160
or maybe if we i don't know what the

1011
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,479
registry policy is at the moment if it

1012
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,960
is just specification required

1013
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,079
then other folks like i can work in

1014
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,240
groups can can

1015
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,079
pretty much define their own reports and

1016
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,640
register them with cyano without the

1017
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,560
need to go

1018
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,319
through and through the rsc process if

1019
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,960
it's just specification required so

1020
00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:03,839
i think that that would be a valuable

1021
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:03,839
extension of that mechanism

1022
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,880
joseph any comment or should i move on

1023
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
to the queue

1024
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,800
yeah uh we're absolutely getting noted

1025
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,839
about the the empty value

1026
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,560
discussion so that would be the open

1027
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,480
questions

1028
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,359
i absolutely uh have more discussion on

1029
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,359
it on the next

1030
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,119
revisions and then in the working group

1031
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,640
as well

1032
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,720
so yes next slide uh no you still have a

1033
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,279
hand up uh jim gould go ahead please

1034
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,279
oh sorry

1035
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,440
draft was quote split and the

1036
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,040
base draft was the framework and

1037
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,000
standards track that would make a lot of

1038
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,759
sense and

1039
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,720
actually to go off of what alex said

1040
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,760
having to create a draft for the actual

1041
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,399
reports

1042
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,920
may not be necessary at all hopefully

1043
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,960
the framework would enable

1044
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,079
the registration of reports without

1045
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,400
having to go through a draft so

1046
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,400
thank you

1047
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,560
so i'll offer a quick response to that

1048
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,720
um

1049
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,920
the uh the the current way this thing is

1050
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,480
defined is

1051
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,720
uh a first come first serve registry

1052
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,160
with specification required

1053
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,919
um so it doesn't have to be an internet

1054
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,078
draft or rfc

1055
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,760
but there does have to exist a

1056
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,800
specification

1057
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,319
for the report and for any data elements

1058
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,880
that might be defined

1059
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,440
also that's similar to the way the epp

1060
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,720
extensions and rdap extensions registry

1061
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,079
was done

1062
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,359
um you know it doesn't make sense to

1063
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,200
to have something if you don't have a

1064
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,480
specification for it somewhere

1065
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,640
although it doesn't necessarily have to

1066
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,319
be an ietf document

1067
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,359
go ahead jim and then we should uh let

1068
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:57,359
joseph continue here

1069
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,160
that that's i think that's the right way

1070
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,160
to go

1071
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:10,560
thank you thank you joseph nope

1072
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,560
nothing so next line

1073
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,839
uh this is the way the iron registry we

1074
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,119
on the

1075
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,440
version two of this draft we uh

1076
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,640
uh focus on on expanding the how the

1077
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,560
registry

1078
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,560
works for the field names and new report

1079
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,319
names it follows the guideline from the

1080
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,319
rsc

1081
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:32,800
a126 it will ask to

1082
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,119
develop a small pool of individuals to

1083
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,359
serve as the designated expert

1084
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,599
that mirrors what we have for the epp

1085
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,040
extensions right now

1086
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,520
we will we propose to use the current

1087
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,520
rejects mailing list for the public's

1088
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,319
discussion for any request

1089
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,119
so that means the rejects mainly will be

1090
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,000
asked to

1091
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,280
continue to to be open and remain

1092
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,680
negative

1093
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,960
even after directors will conclude close

1094
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,759
and conclude

1095
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,760
so next slide

1096
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,839

so the question is um at the moment

1112
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,480
there's a use case

1113
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:04,079
uh in the uplink region

1114
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,599
where there is no no one to uh

1115
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,880
represent uh the case like this one

1116
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,319
web whereby uh the registration

1117
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,560
should happen in accordance with

1118
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,560
the uh ina

1119
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:29,839
there's no one who who who is uh

1120
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,839
in charge and upfront to do this job

1121
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,598
i'm sorry i'm not sure i understand what

1122
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:42,960
your question is uh

1123
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:46,079
tadago um

1124
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,960
the there is there is a use case in

1125
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,240
affini

1126
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:56,640
which is original registry

1127
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:59,680
for ina

1128
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,359
so there's no one in charge of looking

1129
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,598
into this document

1130
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:05,520
there's no representation of that

1131
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:11,359
registry into

1132
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:13,520
the discussion group okay so

1133
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,920
i i think what's in chicago means is

1134
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,280
that he wants to to join the discussion

1135
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,079
so the discussion takes place on the

1136
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,720
mailing list um

1137
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,160
and if you enter the discussion there

1138
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,279
and you want to be part of the

1139
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,000
uh the expert group and i think that's

1140
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,760
where that's

1141
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,440
being discussed so if you want to join

1142
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,760
that join the discussion on the mailing

1143
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,760
list

1144
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:41,599

registry wants to collect

1160
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,040
and as jim you have mentioned before um

this the registration

1162
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,319
process is expected to be first come

1163
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,960
first serve

1164
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,960
next slide

1165
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,000
and this is the least example list of

1166
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,160
the the

1167
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,800
the name of the fields to be expected to

1168
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,359
be part of this draft to be registered

1169
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,359
next slide

1170
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,359
and these are the next four slides is

1171
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:49,279
about about the list of the

1172
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:52,240
the current list of the heading the

1173
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,520
column headers being

1174
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,399
uh being document track

1175
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,680
and the reports this is the ana registry

1176
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,920
the definitions

1177
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,160
and also again the process is expected

1178
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,960
to be first come first serve

1179
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,960

and i have the list of the report names

1181
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,960
and the defeats related from

1182
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,960
the field definitions next

1183
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,800
there's some topics related to this

1184
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,800
draft we have not been

1185
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,400
uh captured and and that will be open

1186
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,720
for discussions

1187
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,160
especially about what should be the name

1188
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,640
for the report

1189
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,720
and what elements should be part of it

1190
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,879
uh if the file is too large

1191
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:48,240
when we do the um

1192
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,880
splitting or if we do any compressions

1193
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,879
next slide

1194
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,720
and and the other related is how the

1195
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,399
repository

1196
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,480
would be look like would it be one

1197
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,520
single uh directory or

1198
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,240
they'll be split by something smaller

1199
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:09,200
like a

1200
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:11,919
date um or the type of the report

1201
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,078
and the last thing is what we what what

1202
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,280
character will be used as a separator

1203
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:20,079
to split the view um

1204
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,480
and and in the current draft we we found

1205
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,079
the

1206
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:27,839
csv format as as

1207
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,400
as a guideline for the for the format

1208
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,400
and nyx

1209
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,000
that's it that's it and thanks everyone

1210
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,839
and

1211
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,839
and thanks for the questions

1212
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,280
so one of the things we want to leave

1213
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,640
the group with here is the question

1214
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,000
of uh status of the framework um

1215
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,720
certainly heard a discussion to split

1216
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,200
this document so that's a good thing

1217
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,799
there's also a question of a milestone

1218
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,839
date which we're going to get to in just

1219
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,079
a moment

1220
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:03,599
but uh we have a question about that too

1221
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,839
for this document

1222
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,040
uh jim gold you have a hand up ahead

1223
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:11,359
please

1224
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,359
fields or the full set of fields you may

1225
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,680
want to look at the data escrow drafts

1226
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,640
as

1227
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,399
an example of the complete set of fields

1228
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,558
that are

1229
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,760
included in registries and domain name

1230
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,839
registries so

1231
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,800
that may be a good reference point for

1232
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,799
what may be needed

1233
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,240
so um just to speak to that directly

1234
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,118
uh jim what we did was look at

1235
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,680
existing reports and and chose to only

1236
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,480
include

1237
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,520
those list of elements as opposed to

1238
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,040
trying to define

1239
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,720
all elements that might exist in

1240
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,680
registration data

1241
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,160
um so the idea being that you would only

1242
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,640
define

1243
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,920
elements that exist in in reports that

1244
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,640
are being used

1245
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,760
uh you know um we could certainly choose

1246
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,839
a different path

1247
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,440
which you're suggesting um we could do

1248
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,400
that if folks think that that's more

1249
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,800
helpful

1250
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,000
um and in that case we might even just

1251
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,920
go back to the

1252
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,839
data mapping document that was mentioned

1253
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,000
earlier and refer to that

1254
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,319
but anyway go ahead you want to respond

1255
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,319
to that

1256
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,559
kind of scenario so if you're going to

1257
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,319
focus on the framework you may want to

1258
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,400
provide a base set of fields

1259
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,240
may not be like every field that's

1260
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,760
defined within data escrow or the data

1261
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,000
mapping

1262
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,760
but a good set of fields that are

1263
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,839
independent of the concrete reports that

1264
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,839
you're aware of

1265
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,640
okay certainly something to think about

1266
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,040
i'm happy to expand the list if that's

1267
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,319
what what folks would like

1268
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,119
yeah same same just happy to look to see

1269
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:48,160
but uh

1270
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,920
i don't remember offhand if off inflow

1271
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,640
would be part of it that's something

1272
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,359
that we measure in divisional to the

1273
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,480
draft

1274
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,839
anything related to privacy or security

1275
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:02,400
related we

1276
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:04,400
we take a cautious approach

1277
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,599
yeah and gavin brown in the chat room

1278
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,839
just to call out

1279
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,040
for the record here is also pointing out

1280
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,119
that there was an inventory of

1281
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,960
registration data elements

1282
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,880
that fed into the development of rdap

1283
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,559
itself so

1284
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,400
we do have a couple of choices here if

1285
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,000
we want to expand the list of potential

1286
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,040
data elements just

1287
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,640
to have a baseline for for use by by all

1288
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,000
reports

1289
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,598
we could certainly explore that if

1290
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,480
that's what folks think would be more

1291
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,440
helpful

1292
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,960
um in in this document you know we can

1293
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,559
certainly do that so we'll take that

1294
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,480
discussion to the mailing list here and

1295
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,800
see what folks want to do

1296
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,160
um putting on a chair hat here i think

1297
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,839
it's important to draw a line under this

1298
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,920
discussion at this point

1299
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,880
and move on we're kind of running out of

1300
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,839
time here

1301
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,880
so let me um get back and say uh thank

1302
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,440
you joseph

1303
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,480
um let's get back to our chair slides

1304
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:59,040
here so we can see where we are

1305
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,839
and uh move to the next thing here

1306
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:02,480
which i believe is a discussion of oh

1307
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,000
now we're gonna have a little

1308
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,599
presentation about some new work before

1309
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,160
we talk about milestones

1310
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,160
so we have a number of items that are in

1311
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,960
front of us and available to us to think

1312
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,480
about

1313
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,400
for um new work um and

1314
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,079
uh we have some presentations that go

1315
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,599
with uh some of these but not all of

1316
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:20,160
them in fact the first one up here is

1317
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,680
the

1318
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,279
unrenewable extension from uh from jody

1319
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,359
um and so we have some time allotted

1320
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,079
here for discussion about these things

1321
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,160
uh jody did you want to uh jump in here

1322
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:34,079
and get us started on the unrenewed

1323
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:37,118
extension

1324
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,160
absolutely can you hear me all right jim

1325
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,000
yes please go ahead all right um i'm

1326
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,598
sorry i don't have any slides for this

1327
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,200
uh and and i'll try to get through this

1328
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,319
as quickly as possible i know i have 20

1329
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,598
minutes but we're running a little bit

1330
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,640
behind

1331
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,000
um quack fam and from godaddy registry

1332
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,440
and i have been working on

1333
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,640
a way to do to undo an explicit renewal

1334
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,280
without deleting the domain um we will

1335
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,680
have a paper

1336
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,760
coming out or submitting a paper that we

1337
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,520
hope can be adopted

1338
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,200
i'll just go through the history of it

1339
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:11,040
first and and the issues that we see

1340
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,558
in order to receive a refund for a

1341
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,160
registration of a domain

1342
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,760
the domain must be deleted within the

1343
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,000
registration grace period

1344
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,559
now this seems to make sense because the

1345
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,720
customer may misspell the domain name

1346
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,240
and then they only have five days after

1347
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,319
the domain's been created

1348
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,479
to delete the domain there's not much to

1349
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,359
be gained by the registrant in gaming

1350
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,400
the system

1351
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,880
um and and it's a and it seems to make

1352
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,000
sense

1353
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,760
uh it's pretty logical um in order to

1354
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,559
receive a refund for a domain that has

1355
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,559
been auto being

1356
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,160
renewed by the registry the registrant

1357
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,319
needs to delete the domain

1358
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,240
again this this makes sense as a as a

1359
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,960
customer has

1360
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,598
been able to use the domain name for the

1361
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,280
entire registration lifecycle

1362
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,640
and they are nearing the end of the well

1363
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,520
they are at the end of the registration

1364
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,839
lifecycle

1365
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,640
usually the main auto renews at the end

1366
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,359
of that

1367
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,720
so the customer has actually paid for

1368
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,880
you know a complete year

1369
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,839
the domain name renews at the end of

1370
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,599
that year or

1371
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,520
auto renews at the end of the year and

1372
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,760
then the customer has 45 days

1373
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,960
and in order to get money back for that

1374
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,799
auto renewal

1375
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:16,240
the the registrant needs to delete the

1376
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,280
domain name the registrant

1377
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,919
and the registrar now for an explicit

1378
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,640
renewal

1379
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,440
which would only happen it's a manual

1380
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,598
renewal not an

1381
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,680
auto renewal by the registry uh explicit

1382
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,520
renewal is sent by the registrar

1383
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,240
and it and it can be sent at any time

1384
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:34,240
during the domain name life cycle

1385
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,759
but one of the issues that that we've

1386
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,359
come across is that

1387
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:39,280
if a customer comes in and they renew

1388
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:41,200
the domain name in the middle of their

1389
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,640
registration life cycle let's say

1390
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,240
they've registered the domain name for

1391
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,558
one year and

1392
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,680
and they come in six months into that

1393
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,760
that year and they did

1394
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,359
they renew the domain name and then

1395
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,160
realize they've done it accidentally

1396
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:54,160
they either

1397
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,078
renewed the wrong domain name they've

1398
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,000
renewed it for too many years

1399
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,880
uh etc but that they are not able to

1400
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,880
remove

1401
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,960
the excess years or the renewal years

1402
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,440
that they've renewed the domain name for

1403
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,200
um unless they delete the domain name

1404
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,119
when they delete the domain name

1405
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,118
they will lose the registration life

1406
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,799
cycle that they've actually paid for

1407
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,319
uh they'll lose the last six months of

1408
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,079
that that life cycle

1409
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,319
and in that time they could have been

1410
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,720
using the domain name for email for

1411
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:23,680
to to build a business to put a website

1412
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,078
on etc

1413
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,720
and now the domain will have to be

1414
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,640
deleted

1415
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,520
in order in order for them to to

1416
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,319
recapture their renewal periods

1417
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,359
now there's various reasons how this

1418
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,520
could happen

1419
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,720
uh you know one of them i think that

1420
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,200
we've all probably

1421
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,160
experienced as is bad a bad internet

1422
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,799
connection

1423
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,759
um if you've ever getting or ever gotten

1424
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,720
to uh

1425
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,359
a cart and you put in your your credit

1426
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,959
card

1427
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:52,880
you've hit the submit button and all of

1428
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,240
a sudden it hangs

1429
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,079
the website hangs you lose your

1430
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,200
connection etc and then

1431
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,400
we're not sure if that whatever you've

1432
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,960
purchased

1433
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,760
has has been completed um this can

1434
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,079
happen to

1435
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,079
registrants and what will happen is

1436
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,440
they'll immediately freak out about it

1437
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,680
and and they'll come in and they'll try

1438
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,079
to purchase it again um

1439
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,359
in in some cases the renewal could have

1440
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,040
actually have gone through have gotten

1441
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,480
to the registrar the registrar's already

1442
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,640
submitted the renewal

1443
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,799
to the registry but unbeknownst to the

1444
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,839
customer um they come in and

1445
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:28,880
get nervous and renew it again

1446
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:32,960
this can happen multiple times um in

1447
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,520
in order to to get back the money that

1448
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,040
they've had

1449
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:37,280
if they've only wanted one renewal and

1450
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,359
they wound up sending six renewals or

1451
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,960
or a five year renewal etc they would

1452
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,078
have to delete that domain name in order

1453
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,599
to get it back

1454
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,440
um they're not willing to delete the

1455
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,240
domain name and forego the rest of their

1456
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:53,599
registration life cycle on that

1457
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,919
we've had this happen many times

1458
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,040
another issue could be with interfaces

1459
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,720
customers could

1460
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,799
could renew the domain name for 10 years

1461
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,399
when they really only wanted to renew it

1462
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,880
for one year

1463
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,400
another issue is as much as i'd like to

1464
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,520
believe that developers are

1465
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,119
uh perfect they are not and uh you know

1466
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,359
developers may institute something

1467
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,960
that's that's renewing domain names for

1468
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,520
the incorrect number of years

1469
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,079
and and there's no way to back that out

1470
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,880
now

1471
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,720
as far as the first issue goes as a

1472
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,440
registrar we've had many calls with

1473
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,520
customers

1474
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,640
trying to explain to them that we're

1475
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:31,839
sorry but in order to get your renewal

1476
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,520
the renewal funds back they would have

1477
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:36,400
to delete the domain name

1478
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,920
um this has led to a lot of extreme

1479
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,920
customer dissatisfaction

1480
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,400
and in some cases we've had to just

1481
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,160
refund the registration or the renewals

1482
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,359
to the to the customer in order to keep

1483
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,799
a happy customer

1484
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:50,880
but we would eat the cost of the

1485
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:53,119
renewals at the registry

1486
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,319
um the way the way that we would see an

1487
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,520
unrenewed command

1488
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:59,279
would work is that what we've discussed

1489
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,880
is adding an unrenew extension to the

1490
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,680
renewal command

1491
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,040
the unrenew would be time bound it could

1492
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,319
only be done

1493
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:12,000
within the uh renewal grace period

1494
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:12,720
and uh so it would usually that's five

1495
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,799
days but

1496
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:17,040
i know different cctlds have different

1497
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:18,960
different restrictions for that

1498
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,200
a successful domain renewal press

1499
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,839
unrenewable request will result in the

1500
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:26,480
renewal charge being refunded

1501
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,279
but the unrenewed does not apply to auto

1502
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,599
renewals

1503
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,359
registers are provided 45 days and auto

1504
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,160
renewable grace period

1505
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:35,598
to delete the domain name and the domain

1506
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,240
is at the end of the lifecycle like i've

1507
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,960
said

1508
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,439
and it shouldn't bother the customer to

1509
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:45,040
delete that domain name at that time

1510
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,920
um we would see the actual unrenew

1511
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:48,558
working as a queue basically if a

1512
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,960
customer

1513
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,640
comes in and let's just say they submit

1514
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,720
five one year renewals

1515
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,000
over and over and over again it would

1516
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,359
then take five

1517
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,880
unrenews uh commands to back those

1518
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:02,640
five years out if that's what they

1519
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,200
wanted to do um

1520
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:07,040
the reason that we would do this is we

1521
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,799
would not want to send

1522
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,240
let's just say in that previous example

1523
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,640
customer had renewed it

1524
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:14,160
five times for five years we wouldn't

1525
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,319
want to be able to say

1526
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,799
uh let's send it an unrenewed command

1527
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:21,599
for just two of those years

1528
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:23,440
what we found in discussions is that it

1529
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,160
helps the accounting department

1530
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,160
um to be able to line up you know an

1531
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,879
unrenewed command with a renew command

1532
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,680
to determine when when uh when costs

1533
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,680
have been backed out

1534
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,200
um there are other things to consider

1535
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,720
here too is like

1536
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,439
you know how could how could a renewed

1537
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:45,200
command an unrenewed command be gamed

1538
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,040
uh uh how could an unrenewed command

1539
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,680
should should it unrind the renewals

1540
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,400
that set the expiration date in the past

1541
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,000
um i'm sorry i didn't say that right an

1542
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,760
unrenewed command should never

1543
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,559
unwind renewal commands that set the

1544
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,520
expiration dates in the past

1545
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,960
for example you should not be able to

1546
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,038
take away renewal years

1547
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,160
and then suddenly the expiration date is

1548
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,079
two years in the past

1549
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:12,078
that that just should not be done um

1550
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,680
and then obviously the unrenewed command

1551
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,160
should only be allowed within that

1552
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,440
explicit reading and grace period and

1553
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,078
then there

1554
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,440
are going to be other registry policy

1555
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,440
considerations and

1556
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,559
i believe i can policy considerations

1557
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,079
also

1558
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:28,480
um i know i went through that pretty

1559
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:32,960
quick but that that's the

1560
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:35,599
that's my presentation any thoughts

1561
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,319
so thanks jody um you have a question

1562
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,160
from uh jim reid in the in the chat room

1563
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:41,839
um before the queue here where he asks

1564
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:44,160
about is under new an epp

1565
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:48,319
issue or something to be fixed in the

1566
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:52,319
registry's business logic

1567
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:55,520
um that that's a good question

1568
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:56,640
um you know a registry could implement

1569
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,038
an unrenew by

1570
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,799
allowing a customer or a registrar to

1571
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,760
call in and say hey i'd like to unrenew

1572
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,720
three of these

1573
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,760
10-year domain renewals that i just sent

1574
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,879
in

1575
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:11,520
in epp command is something that we

1576
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,200
that we would see to be an advantage

1577
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,200
because

1578
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,558
we see thousands of these a month i mean

1579
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,359
it is it is quite

1580
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:23,760
uh it it's a very big problem for us

1581
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:26,480
and in sending a thousand emails to the

1582
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,599
registry to unrenew those domains

1583
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,640
i don't think it's something that we

1584
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,160
want to do

1585
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,799
okay thanks gavin you have your hand up

1586
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:38,000
go ahead please thank you jim yeah so

1587
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:38,640
um thank you jody for for for talking

1588
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,119
about this

1589
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,000
um this idea i had a few things i wanted

1590
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,599
to to just

1591
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,280
bring to the attention of everyone on

1592
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,280
this on in their meeting

1593
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,720
first one is that there is actually um

1594
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:51,599
prior art for this

1595
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,078
um the uh i believe the nominee registry

1596
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,400
system has an unrenew command i don't

1597
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,720
know

1598
01:03:54,400 --> 01:04:00,640
i did um i think it was a pre-epp but it

1599
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,598
i'm pretty sure that that existed so

1600
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,759
there is at least one

1601
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,119
registry of reasonable scale that is

1602
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,319
offering this service

1603
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:11,440
um my um

1604
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:12,000
experience um is very similar to jodie's

1605
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,359
in that we

1606
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,359
we quite regularly see um

1607
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:19,680
issues like this happening and and there

1608
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,038
are often um you know legitimate reasons

1609
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,240
why this happens i mean you know

1610
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,640
where this happens where people do

1611
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,558
things in good faith come out with a

1612
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,759
an effect that they um they hadn't

1613
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,319
anticipated

1614
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,319
one example that would be where someone

1615
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,920
uh renews a domain during the alter a

1616
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,240
new grace period not being aware of the

1617
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,319
fact that the domain has auto renewed

1618
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,000
um and i wanted to raise that as an

1619
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:43,200
additional use case

1620
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,160
um thirdly i wanted i don't know jody do

1621
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,879
you have any

1622
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,440
actual text around this do you have a

1623
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,599
draft

1624
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,640
that's that's in the works for this

1625
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,680
because

1626
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:57,279
um about five years ago

1627
01:04:53,680 --> 01:05:00,558
i actually published a draft um

1628
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:05,520
called the reverse extension which was

1629
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:07,839
more general purpose than an unrenew

1630
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,960
and was a was a general framework to

1631
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,200
allow an epp

1632
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,880
client to request that a previous

1633
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,919
command that had submitted be reversed

1634
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,720
in some way that the

1635
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,799
the main use case was to reverse an

1636
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,839
accidental renewal but was

1637
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,119
designed to be more general in that the

1638
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,319
client could specify

1639
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,520
any um any previous command that it

1640
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:28,799
submitted using the

1641
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,720
the transaction id the client

1642
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,720
transaction id um

1643
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,319
and then request the server to reverse

1644
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,359
that command and then get a notification

1645
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:37,520
if they had done so

1646
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,038
through the message queue so if you

1647
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,720
don't have a

1648
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,319
a document that you would like to push

1649
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,799
through then that

1650
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:46,319
that draft that i wrote back in 2015

1651
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:50,319
might be

1652
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:52,400
a good basis for future work

1653
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,440
and thanks gavin i appreciate that i

1654
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,599
didn't know there was a

1655
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,119
previous work on that but we have been

1656
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:58,400
working on a document that we've been

1657
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,640
passing back and forth

1658
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,160
but but i i would love to take a look at

1659
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,078
that if you have a

1660
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,879
if you have a link to that or or is that

1661
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,440
in the ietf somewhere

1662
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,240
i just posted a link to it in the chat

1663
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,240
excellent thanks

1664
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:17,440
and uh before we go to alex um jay daly

1665
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:21,039
also put in the chat a pointer to

1666
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,400
uk's unrenew command just call out for

1667
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:24,960
folks to

1668
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,079
take a look at to understand um alex

1669
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,079
have your hand up go ahead please

1670
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,920
yes thank you um i just want to make a

1671
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:36,160
clarifying question uh jody do you

1672
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,200
imagine that you can do a multi-year

1673
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,078
renewal like five years and then you can

1674
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,558
unrenew a single out of those years

1675
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,480
because

1676
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,480
i believe the more options there are

1677
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,919
our registries are essentially like

1678
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:55,520
navigating a set of icebergs already

1679
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,680
and every every chain makes the business

1680
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,480
logic more complicated like

1681
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,960
decree or is that everything works

1682
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,359
together smoothly so so i would

1683
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,559
i would strongly oppose that you can

1684
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:14,799
like splits

1685
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:16,640
existing commands between the really

1686
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:18,079
i think thanks for your question alex we

1687
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,200
had discussed that

1688
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,480
and uh um being able to say if you renew

1689
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,799
the domain name for ten years and then

1690
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,400
sending it on renew for like three years

1691
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,240
of those ten years so that you would

1692
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,400
have a seven-year renewal um

1693
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:31,919
we decided as you said that that just

1694
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,039
got too complicated

1695
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,520
um on the registry side to implement and

1696
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,880
it did lead to some business logic and

1697
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
some accounting principles that we

1698
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:42,400
weren't

1699
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,240
comfortable with that's why we we

1700
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,319
decided that

1701
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:47,839
it would it would be best and looking

1702
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:51,119
for feedback on this

1703
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:52,480
if the unrenewed command just undid the

1704
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,760
previous renewal the

1705
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:58,240
the most recent previous renewal so

1706
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,599
as i said um if if a customer came in

1707
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,118
and let's just say they did

1708
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:02,319
a one-year renewal followed by a

1709
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:03,599
two-year renewal followed by a

1710
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:05,759
three-year renewal

1711
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,280
for some reason the first unrenewed

1712
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,280
command would undo the three-year

1713
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,920
renewal the second unrenewed command

1714
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,160
would un

1715
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,520
do the the two-year renewal and then the

1716
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,279
third one would undo

1717
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,198
the one-year renewal just to keep

1718
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,839
everything in a queue

1719
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:20,719
and then it would just uh undo the

1720
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,600
previous

1721
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:25,679
actual renewal um regardless of how many

1722
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,120
years it was

1723
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,120
does that answer your question alex

1724
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,278
yes indeed it does i mean unrolling the

1725
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:36,158
queue itself is

1726
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,359
is is not a another fun problem to

1727
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,439
address itself

1728
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,839
so i my reference would be that only the

1729
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,879
last renew command could be reversed but

1730
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:47,040
but um well

1731
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,640
i see my developer cringe as soon as i

1732
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,080
say well you have to keep a queue of

1733
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,080
renewal commands that

1734
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,960
i understand your business logic and it

1735
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,600
doesn't help you if you can only unrenew

1736
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,600
the last one

1737
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:08,799
thanks alex you know i i think that

1738
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,520
maybe that could be part of a

1739
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:12,880
part of our registry uh a registry

1740
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,560
option i guess or

1741
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,560
our server option thanks

1742
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,640
okay thanks alex and rick you're going

1743
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,239
to get the last word here and then we um

1744
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,319
have to move on to keep up with our

1745
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:27,358
agenda

1746
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,880
good uh thank you jim rick wilhelm um so

1747
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,960
one i i agree with

1748
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,080
the previous comment that you made jody

1749
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,439
about uh

1750
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,960
not doing a partial on renew that from a

1751
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,879
from a business and accounting and

1752
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,439
reporting standpoint that sounds like a

1753
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,719
real headache so plus one of that um

1754
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:44,639
overall

1755
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,000
this the unrenews is very interesting

1756
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,600
and i think i think has a lot of

1757
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,600
potential to be very useful

1758
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,960
uh the the challenge though that i see

1759
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,880
in this is that this is

1760
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,560
really um heavily dependent on the

1761
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,760
business rules and

1762
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,600
something to which uh jim reed alluded

1763
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,679
brought up in chat and alex also kind of

1764
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:07,280
brought up and i think and

1765
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:10,640
the the issue there is that um

1766
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:13,280
at least for most for gtld registries

1767
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,640
which are a large part of the the use

1768
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,639
use case for this

1769
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,840
this is going to have to go through a

1770
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,800
fair bit of

1771
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,320
icann policy related work i think in

1772
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,920
order for it to

1773
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:28,799
uh get traction and so i think that

1774
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,000
we need to be mindful of that as we go

1775
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,480
forward because

1776
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,120
then later that when at least if it goes

1777
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,919
forward

1778
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:37,840
the the wording in the document is

1779
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,040
flexible in order to accommodate what

1780
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,280
goes on in that

1781
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,480
in that policy work because while you

1782
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,400
know i agree with

1783
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:46,000
what jim said is that this shouldn't be

1784
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,040
sort of the icann standardization

1785
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,159
mechanism

1786
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,519
this does operate in a pretty in inside

1787
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:54,080
of a context

1788
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,600
and that context is a lot of uh has a

1789
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,960
lot of business rules

1790
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,480
um and not the least of which and some

1791
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,800
of the complicated ones around here

1792
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,959
relate to reporting requirements

1793
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,239
and also there's fees that gets charged

1794
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,760
and things like that so

1795
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,519
i think that that's something that if

1796
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,080
draft does go forward we'll have to

1797
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,800
take into account and then for it to

1798
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:14,719
actually take

1799
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,239
root in the gtld speech they have to be

1800
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,400
icann policy work

1801
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:20,400
uh i believe done uh thank you very much

1802
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:26,320
thanks rick uh i was trying to keep the

1803
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,120
four letter acronym out of here

1804
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,880
but but i i i agree we had we had

1805
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,360
discussed whether an arser would have to

1806
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,960
be

1807
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:35,280
or an rsep would have to be done for

1808
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,280
this um and and yes i

1809
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,880
i'm not blind to the fact that this

1810
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:41,920
could cause a lot of

1811
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,840
um issues with icann and and how

1812
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:47,120
how it could be implemented but i

1813
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,120
appreciate the feedback thanks

1814
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,080
okay thank you jody um we look forward

1815
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,840
to moving on with this

1816
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:55,120
uh so we'll move on to the next item in

1817
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,960
our our new work here

1818
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:00,719
uh the uh js contact in in rdap uh this

1819
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,840
is something we

1820
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,520
actually i don't know if we had the

1821
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,520
discussion here in this group before but

1822
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:09,360
it certainly has been presented

1823
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:11,679
in other uh registration uh fora

1824
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,559
but uh over to you gavin uh go ahead

1825
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,600
please

1826
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,440
thank you jim yeah um so yeah so um i

1827
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,640
was i was going to uh the first thing i

1828
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,280
was going to say is that many of you may

1829
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,280
have been

1830
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,679
uh introduced to this topic at the the

1831
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,800
registration operations workshop so

1832
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:28,640
um as a result of that i've uh

1833
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,480
i'm trying not to to kind of cover the

1834
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,360
same too much of the same ground

1835
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,480
um obviously the reason why uh mario and

1836
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,920
i are bringing this to

1837
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,199
uh to the regex group uh this itf

1838
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,960
meeting is because we

1839
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:42,480
we're asking uh for it to be considered

1840
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,280
for adoption by the working group

1841
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,239
so um i'm just gonna give a precede of

1842
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,400
of the heart of this

1843
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:49,599
uh this this draft at a high level so

1844
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,679
that um that that

1845
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,800
consideration can take place so if you

1846
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:54,320
wouldn't mind moving on to the next

1847
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,280
slide

1848
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,759
um i think anyone in this room uh who

1849
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,519
has

1850
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,320
uh worked with rdap would probably agree

1851
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,159
that the

1852
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,759
the the use of j card to represent

1853
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:07,519
contact information is the

1854
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,040
one of the biggest sources of pain from

1855
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,800
an implementation point of view whether

1856
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,920
you're a server implementer or a client

1857
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:15,040
implementer

1858
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,719
um jay card for those who you know who

1859
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,640
need reminding or or are not familiar

1860
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,760
with it is a

1861
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,880
a transliteration or a conversion of v

1862
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,400
card um which is those little dot vcf

1863
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,960
files that you get on when you when

1864
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,159
uh that are digital business cards into

1865
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,040
json

1866
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:35,120
um and because it's a attempt to kind of

1867
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,320
losslessly convert jaycon

1868
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,640
j card j sorry v card into jason

1869
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:41,840
the resulting json syntax is extremely

1870
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,679
unwieldy

1871
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:45,920
um essentially because it's almost to

1872
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,800
the point of it's it's a it's a machine

1873
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,280
interpretation

1874
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,040
or rather than a human readable

1875
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,559
representation

1876
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,640
um mario has done some research

1877
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,239
i i wasn't able to provide a reference

1878
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,880
to this but i'm sure mario will be able

1879
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:03,678
to um that something at least half

1880
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,560
more than half of um all of the rdap

1881
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,960
records for

1882
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,199
the nic zones in the gtld space contain

1883
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:12,239
at least one j-card error

1884
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:15,280
so even even you know as i'd say a

1885
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:17,040
majority of tld operators

1886
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,880
are unable to correctly construct a

1887
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:22,000
j-card

1888
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,520
object and that clearly means that there

1889
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,199
are there are serious challenges

1890
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,360
in interoperability um in maintain

1891
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:29,360
maintainability

1892
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,480
and just in the the doing the work of

1893
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,159
implementing

1894
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:37,199
jcard in odd app servers um

1895
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:39,920
and so um looking at

1896
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:43,440
alternative options uh one that that

1897
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,960
comes to mind is just contact which

1898
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,239
provides a simpler and more efficient

1899
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,440
representation of of contact information

1900
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,440
so next slide please

1901
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:57,199
um js contact is

1902
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,159
a draft that's being developed

1903
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:00,559
separately from

1904
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,120
from this draft and it's part of an

1905
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:06,320
overall effort to try and

1906
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,480
standardize um restful interaction

1907
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,199
with productivity systems like email

1908
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:14,480
calendaring and address books

1909
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:17,678
and we're making use of that

1910
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,440
work to make it available to uh rdap

1911
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,280
implementations

1912
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:22,719
it's a json native representation of

1913
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,360
contact data it doesn't

1914
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,440
doesn't kind of um it's not a

1915
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,320
compilation artifact in the way that js

1916
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,839
card is

1917
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:35,280
j card is sorry i get confused um

1918
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,159
it's uh it also has a number of features

1919
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,360
that um

1920
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:41,280
that are either not available in uh j

1921
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,839
card or are not easily implemented in j

1922
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,920
card

1923
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,880
particularly around unstructured contact

1924
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,440
information and

1925
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,480
internationalized contact information um

1926
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,519
and particularly on the

1927
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:53,199
internationalization

1928
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:56,640
front um there are there are long-term

1929
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:59,280
efforts taking place to uh to make

1930
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,360
representation and access access to

1931
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:03,280
internationalized registration data

1932
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,960
which can be collected through epp but

1933
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:09,040
is currently not available to

1934
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:11,199
to any consumers um make that available

1935
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,960
and and this provides a route to do that

1936
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,480
through odd app

1937
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,199
it's much easier for a client

1938
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:20,239
implementer to to process

1939
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:23,280
um the the structure of the the js

1940
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:26,159
card objects is is much more logical

1941
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,679
um it's easier to access um data

1942
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,719
elements because they're primarily

1943
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:32,320
they're named

1944
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:35,679
rather than occupying a position in an

1945
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:38,159
indexed array and

1946
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:40,159
there are um it is relatively

1947
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:43,519
straightforward to convert j card and

1948
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:47,360
into js card and vice versa mario

1949
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:50,640
has a a repository of tools which can

1950
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:53,120
allow this to take place um and

1951
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:55,040
you can see the the the identity of the

1952
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,920
the draft that outlines this

1953
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,600
uh specification with js contact um at

1954
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,840
the bottom boiling point

1955
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,840
um next slide please

1956
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:10,320
so our draft provides a way for a uh

1957
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:12,719
a nile app server operator to to

1958
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,759
to go through a transition process from

1959
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,719
um

1960
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,320
only using jcard in responses to only

1961
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,360
using js card

1962
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:24,880
excuse me um the actual

1963
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:25,920
the actual use of js contact or js card

1964
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,400
objects in

1965
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:30,560
rdp responses is is very straightforward

1966
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:34,320
you simply remove the b card array

1967
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:37,199
uh from the uh from the the

1968
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,480
entity object and replace it with a js

1969
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:42,559
card object

1970
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:44,559
um so very very little in the way of um

1971
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,480
substantial changes to the rdap

1972
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,520
responses themselves

1973
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,799
other than one one one data element gets

1974
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,960
swapped out for another

1975
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,320
but there is a need to signal to a

1976
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,520
client that

1977
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:00,960
a server does support js card

1978
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,320
and also a way to gracefully transition

1979
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,199
from from the current state to the

1980
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,880
future state

1981
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:07,678
so that so the document describes a

1982
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,080
transition process with four phases

1983
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,159
um the first phase obviously is that is

1984
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,640
the kind of current steady state where j

1985
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:17,519
cardo

1986
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:19,840
is the only option um the second state

1987
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:22,000
makes js card available optionally if a

1988
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,040
client sets a

1989
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,440
a query parameter and the

1990
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,080
the server can can indicate to clients

1991
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:32,879
that it supports js card using a notice

1992
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:34,320
and also using the idap performance

1993
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:38,239
array

1994
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,000
um the the third stage would be to uh to

1995
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:43,120
switch the default uh

1996
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,840
from uh jcard to js card

1997
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:47,040
and clients that still require the j

1998
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,159
card can

1999
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,719
uh can retrieve um the jcard version of

2000
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:56,239
a response by setting a query parameter

2001
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:58,719
um so the the the the the the default

2002
01:18:56,239 --> 01:18:59,440
is switched between phases two and three

2003
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,280
and then

2004
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:02,799
the fourth phase which i suppose is

2005
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,800
probably completely optional and

2006
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,120
and a server operator that wanted to

2007
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,840
offer both indefinitely could could just

2008
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,880
not

2009
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:12,320
move to phase four would be

2010
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,080
to remove support for the query

2011
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,920
parameter to a nail that

2012
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:20,159
allows the client to query for j cut

2013
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,920
so a server operator may wish to to

2014
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:23,120
completely remove support for jcard and

2015
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,040
get rid of all that code that they've

2016
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,640
got in their system to to support that

2017
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,640
or they could just leave things where

2018
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,199
they stand and allow jaycard to be

2019
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,560
available

2020
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:32,639
indefinitely should they should they

2021
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,480
choose the

2022
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,000
draft itself doesn't specify the

2023
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,759
duration of any of these phases

2024
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:41,520
so that's again up to the server

2025
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,520
operator to decide whether they want to

2026
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:50,080
specify short long or very long phases

2027
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:53,520
between the different transition steps

2028
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:56,000
next slide please so just a little bit

2029
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,760
of metadata about the the draft itself

2030
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,040
um we published the first version in

2031
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:01,440
march this year

2032
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:02,560
um the there have been three three

2033
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:05,919
subsequent reverse

2034
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,960
revisions um there is

2035
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:11,199
some work still to do um

2036
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,480
but we we kind of feel that the best

2037
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,400
place for that work to take place is

2038
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,559
within the working group now because

2039
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:18,400
um we really want to bring in as many

2040
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:20,239
stakeholders as possible to to try and

2041
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,638
get to get some eyeballs onto onto this

2042
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,400
to

2043
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:24,239
to hammer out the educations and the

2044
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,440
complexities so

2045
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,440
this is why we're advancing it for

2046
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,199
consideration um

2047
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,559
we have one implementation currently

2048
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,799
available which is in

2049
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:34,480
it they have that in their in their um

2050
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:38,080
test bed system

2051
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:39,360
um and obviously we would look to uh to

2052
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,199
get at least one more additional

2053
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:43,759
implementation and and some client

2054
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:46,239
implementations as well if possible

2055
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,280
um when i presented this at the row um

2056
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:49,678
there was

2057
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:51,679
very positive feedback i think very few

2058
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:55,440
people said that jay card was

2059
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:58,639
uh was um was fun to work with

2060
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,480
and um i think that that's uh

2061
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,320
that was positive and encouraging and i

2062
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,718
think um we need to

2063
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,519
uh harness that that enthusiasm for an

2064
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,159
alternative

2065
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,880
um as quickly as possible so that we can

2066
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,480
um

2067
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,960
get rid of j card and everyone can get

2068
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:16,320
on with their deal with their jobs

2069
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:19,360
um so that's it really um so

2070
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:21,120
um if uh

2071
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,000
that's uh yeah that's all i have to say

2072
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,000
so questions

2073
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,159
thanks kevin so for the working group

2074
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:32,480
this

2075
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,159
is the uh all of this new work uh the

2076
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:36,000
presentation we're listening to here

2077
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:38,239
here uh the worker is gonna have to

2078
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,840
consider if it wants to adopt the work

2079
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:41,678
um that'll be a question we'll take to

2080
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,159
the mailing list and also interested in

2081
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:47,360
any discussion here on those questions

2082
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:49,839
uh alex go ahead please

2083
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,199
just very briefly having implemented

2084
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:55,440
another prototype

2085
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:57,919
recently i really like getting rid of

2086
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:58,480
three cards and so i i support this word

2087
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,880
to be

2088
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,879
forward

2089
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,679
excellent thanks alex glad to hear it

2090
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,840
any other questions or comments for

2091
01:22:09,199 --> 01:22:11,839
gavin

2092
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,360
so thanks gavin and mario um

2093
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,639
we'll certainly look to bring the

2094
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,360
question to the group here about

2095
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,159
adopting

2096
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:23,280
this work and moving forward with it

2097
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:25,839
okay

2098
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:25,840
next up

2099
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:38,400
we have internationalized email

2100
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:43,440
addresses and i have a

2101
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:45,440
presentation here for that dimitri

2102
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,199
are you with us and ready to go good i

2103
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,839
see you there in the queue

2104
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:51,919
let me get this full screen here for you

2105
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:54,719
and yes we can hear you go ahead please

2106
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,719
oh wonderful

2107
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,159
next slide please

2108
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:07,040
first of all some words for background

2109
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:12,080
the email address internalization

2110
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,080
were specified in a set of services

2111
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:19,120
6530-6533

2112
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:22,800
they are in this or that stage of

2113
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:26,080
deployment now the main

2114
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,400
feature of this set of standard is uh

2115
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,199
that they allow non-ascii left part of

2116
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,759
the email addresses

2117
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:34,320
but anyway a lot of protocols still

2118
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,679
refer

2119
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:40,799
to the old

2120
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:44,159
syntaxes of email addresses and

2121
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:48,480
it means that if we

2122
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:51,679
want to implement the yeah addresses

2123
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:55,159
it requires explicit uh protocol

2124
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:58,400
changes for example rfc

2125
01:23:55,159 --> 01:24:01,599
8399 introduced such changes

2126
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:04,719
into certification

2127
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:07,520
in the x509 certification profile

2128
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:07,520
next slide please

2129
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,120
the intention of my work is

2130
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:17,360
support of such addresses in the epp

2131
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:22,320
protocol

2132
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:22,320
this addresses should be

2133
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:29,040
first class objects

2134
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,040
not the secondary one

2135
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:34,480
these addresses should also

2136
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,759
[Music]

2137
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:40,239
be supported in all the objects

2138
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,719
in all the app objects that have email

2139
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:46,080
addresses as an attribute

2140
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:49,120
uh for example such objects are

2141
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:52,719
app contact app organization

2142
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:56,000
and there are some uh

2143
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:58,800
epp extensions that also use

2144
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:01,120
email addresses as attributes next slide

2145
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,120
please

2146
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:08,559
so we have more than one possible

2147
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:12,239
implementation approaches

2148
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:17,600
currently the xml schema

2149
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:17,599
allows yay addresses

2150
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:23,360
and there are at least

2151
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,320
two major registry vendors tongue and

2152
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:27,759
new stars

2153
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:30,000
that silently allow

2154
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,000
to

2155
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:38,320
provide the non-ask email address

2156
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:38,320
via epp

2157
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:46,879
we also can define an

2158
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:50,239
epp extension uh currently

2159
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:54,400
in the current version of the draft uh

2160
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:58,559
it's done this way via placeholder

2161
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:02,480
is similar to rfc 8807

2162
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:06,840
login security extension we can

2163
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:10,080
also allow such addresses

2164
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:14,239
implicitly when

2165
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,239
we indicate support of this

2166
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:21,360
uh syntax in

2167
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:23,520
login on logi only

2168
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,559
process and we can have replacement

2169
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,560
macro element to

2170
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:31,199
show that we have uh

2171
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:39,759
non-ascii email address anyway

2172
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:43,040
it seems reasonable that uh we

2173
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:47,760
should indicate uh support of this

2174
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:51,840
uh syntax via new xml namespace

2175
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,840
next slide please

2176
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,679
so it's not enough to change the

2177
01:26:54,560 --> 01:27:02,000
protocol we also need to change

2178
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:05,040
documents formally

2179
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:09,400
it's technically possible to treat uh

2180
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:13,440
rfc 6530 as an update to rfc

2181
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,440
5322 but

2182
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,480
there is a consensus on the list that

2183
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:23,199
yep dragons

2184
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,199
this approach

2185
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:30,879
meant that we

2186
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,960
should have optional smtp extension to

2187
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:36,239
indicate that the

2188
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:40,719
knowledge email support and

2189
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:46,159
that's why the this set of rfc does not

2190
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:51,600
supersede the earlier specifications

2191
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:51,599
we can see we can uh update

2192
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:56,800
rfcs5733 and

2193
01:27:54,199 --> 01:28:00,400
8543

2194
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:07,040
just to say that the email syntax

2195
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:07,040
now should refer to rfc e6500532

2196
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:15,040
and we also can specify

2197
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:17,760
a separate document which is current

2198
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,760
current draft

2199
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:26,799
we are a pay extension option

2200
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,840
oh there was a

2201
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:33,520
fruitful discussion on the mailing list

2202
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:36,719
all these options were raised

2203
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,159
many thanks to james gold and scott

2204
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:44,480
holland back

2205
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:50,799
for their patience uh and their efforts

2206
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:50,799
so i think we should discuss it now

2207
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:58,719
how to deal with this document

2208
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,639
thanks thanks dimitri

2209
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,480
um we already have a couple of people

2210
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:05,600
queued up here so let's jump right in

2211
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,519
alex go ahead please

2212
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,639
thank you thanks timothy good of work

2213
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,520
can jim can you

2214
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:13,760
go back to like i think two slides up to

2215
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,760
the

2216
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:19,360
uh sorry the the the following one

2217
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:27,519
sorry um yes exactly

2218
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,719
um i mean dimitri you mentioned you made

2219
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:30,000
an interesting point during your

2220
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:33,440
presentation you said

2221
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,120
we can at uh an epp extension but i have

2222
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,799
never heard we need to

2223
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:39,599
yeah and i think you answered that in

2224
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,360
the first line on your presentation

2225
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,040
i don't see any reason why we would not

2226
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,440
allow uh eai

2227
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,440
in the standard email uh attributes of

2228
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,919
the of the epp contact

2229
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:51,440
and if if a server does not support it

2230
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,320
they would return a three

2231
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:55,919
2 306 per meter policy error in epp

2232
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,559
explaining that it's not possible and

2233
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,639
that's it

2234
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:02,480
uh so uh i quite frankly

2235
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:04,719
maybe i missed something but i don't see

2236
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:07,199
that there is much radio edit here

2237
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:08,880
besides like pushing at another epp

2238
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:11,280
extension on top of the registry and

2239
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:14,560
registrars that they need to support

2240
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,559
um i don't see the value

2241
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:21,840
i agree that it's one of the reasonable

2242
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,840
approaches

2243
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:32,239
but i don't

2244
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:35,839
i published it as an option because

2245
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:37,919
all this option should be discussed

2246
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:40,320
without consensus we anyway can't move

2247
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,320
ahead

2248
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:46,719
okay jim cool have your hand up go ahead

2249
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,840
please

2250
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:57,520
i uh actually i can help answer alex's

2251
01:30:53,280 --> 01:31:00,800
uh uh comments as well is the fact that

2252
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:03,280
yeah the xml schema does support um

2253
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:04,080
internationalized email addresses but

2254
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,719
there is no

2255
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:07,840
signaling whatsoever in epp at this

2256
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:11,600
point that would

2257
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:15,040
indicate that servers do in fact support

2258
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:18,239
internationalized email addresses so um

2259
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:20,159
to me it seems like having a simple epp

2260
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:20,480
extension would be the better route to

2261
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:23,440
go

2262
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:25,280
to at least provide that signaling um

2263
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:27,120
and also

2264
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:28,960
i believe that it's better to have some

2265
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,519
explicit xml

2266
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,080
to indicate the intent of the client

2267
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,320
that they

2268
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:35,440
are passing internationalized email

2269
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:37,840
addresses to a

2270
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,960
for a specific object whether it's a

2271
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,840
contact or an

2272
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,440
organization or one of the proprietary

2273
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,800
extensions that are out there

2274
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:47,839
so of the options um that are on this

2275
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,880
slide

2276
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,800
uh i i personally uh

2277
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,400
would prefer the replacement marker

2278
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:59,360
element

2279
01:31:54,400 --> 01:32:02,400
out of those options thank you

2280
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,920
thanks jim any comment to meet me or

2281
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:09,199
should we go on to scott uh we

2282
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,199
can go on discussion

2283
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:14,799
go ahead scott thanks jim scott holland

2284
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,880
back here and i know i'm probably

2285
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:20,560
channeling alex a little bit here um

2286
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:22,960
but i think you know part of the issue

2287
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:26,159
here is not really about the xml

2288
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,800
um it's that a lot of implementations

2289
01:32:26,159 --> 01:32:30,080
have

2290
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,520
another layer of processing that is

2291
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,239
problematic like

2292
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,040
a regular expression parser or for

2293
01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:37,280
example

2294
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:38,800
you know that that's used to look at the

2295
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,719
you know the left side of an email

2296
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,080
address and make sure that it conforms

2297
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:43,440
to the syntax

2298
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,360
you know specified in the current

2299
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,759
normative references

2300
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,759
and and so i think we do need some kind

2301
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:51,120
of a signaling mechanism

2302
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,040
you know between the client and the

2303
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:55,599
server to indicate

2304
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:57,040
support for something that would do

2305
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,280
something different in terms of

2306
01:32:57,040 --> 01:33:02,480
validating the local part

2307
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,159
so um i'm definitely not a fan

2308
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:05,839
of you know going back and trying to

2309
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:07,679
update the core epp

2310
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,120
rfcs for example i mean this is the

2311
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,880
whole reason we have an extension

2312
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:12,800
mechanism so we could add

2313
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,080
capabilities like this without updating

2314
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,760
these core specs

2315
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:18,080
and so if we decide that we want to do

2316
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,840
this i i definitely prefer the idea of

2317
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:22,480
coming up with an extension

2318
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,320
new xml namespace and some type of a

2319
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,559
signaling mechanism so that people and

2320
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:28,239
you know clients and servers know that

2321
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:29,600
um you need to do something different

2322
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,440
here you know to allow

2323
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:37,840
non-ascii characters in the local part

2324
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:37,839
of an email address

2325
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:43,679
thanks scott um i'll just

2326
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,639
speak for myself and comment quickly

2327
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,520
that uh

2328
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,480
you know i i wonder sometimes why people

2329
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,880
have uh

2330
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,000
make any business of um uh checking the

2331
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,520
local parts

2332
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,199
uh should be allowed to be whatever

2333
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,159
whatever the user wanted it to be but i

2334
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,919
i do get

2335
01:33:56,159 --> 01:34:00,080
usability concerns we like to help the

2336
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:02,639
user make sure they do the right thing

2337
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:05,840
um so uh john kang you have your hand up

2338
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,840

ei is deploying

2343
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:28,159
is currently in deploying many

2344
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:30,239
email service providers such as

2345
01:34:28,159 --> 01:34:33,599
microsoft uh

2346
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:36,159
google and uh apple so for

2347
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,960

china and

2349
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:45,440
india and other countries all have

2350
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:48,960
deployed yeah so service so some country

2351
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,960
some users or

2352
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:58,000
regis registrants need a year address

2353
01:34:54,320 --> 01:35:01,199
so i think we need such a extension

2354
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:04,239
and maybe an epp extension

2355
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:08,239
to have included a

2356
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:10,000
eir address so i think it will be good

2357
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:15,839
for the future

2358
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:15,840
that's my point thank you

2359
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:19,839
and uh jim gold you're going to get the

2360
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:22,000
last word here and then we have to move

2361
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,000
on

2362
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,000
uh one other point scott already brought

2363
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:30,239
up about the

2364
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,400
the fact that it's not an xml issue but

2365
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,280
there is an issue on the server side and

2366
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:36,320
the fact that

2367
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:39,920
how the data is stored because uh

2368
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:43,519
the domain part could be peanut code

2369
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:45,920
but the local part could be utf-8 and

2370
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,000
pretty much the ability for the server

2371
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,920
support storing that utf-8

2372
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,119
is important from a signaling

2373
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,520
perspective

2374
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:53,519
thank you

2375
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,199
thank you dimitri closing comments yeah

2376
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:03,520
closing comment uh

2377
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:06,960
so i hope that this document

2378
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:11,280
will be adopted in this of that form

2379
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:14,400
and i hope that it will be possible to

2380
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:16,639
get some consensus of what approach is

2381
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:18,879
preferable for most of us

2382
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:18,880
thanks

2383
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,040
thanks dmitry i think the question for

2384
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:27,199
the working group

2385
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:28,719
is um based on this discussion there's

2386
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:31,678
some question as to whether

2387
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:33,360
there is something to do here so part of

2388
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:36,000
adopting it

2389
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,880
for us to think about here will come to

2390
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,880
that question

2391
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,639
is do we do we believe that there's work

2392
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:42,880
to be done here since one of the options

2393
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:45,920
was to do nothing

2394
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:48,000
so we do need to think about whether we

2395
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,360
want to focus on the signaling mechanism

2396
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,440
and then we can talk about the way in

2397
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,960
which to do that so i just want to put

2398
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:54,320
that out there for the working group to

2399
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,119
keep that in mind

2400
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:58,639
as we go forward uh tom harrison or

2401
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:00,080
george michelson i'm not sure which one

2402
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:01,679
of you was going to do the presentation

2403
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,519
are you ready to go

2404
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,199
and tom you have your mic off so over to

2405
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,600
you

2406
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:08,480
can you hear me yes we can go ahead

2407
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,239
please

2408
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:12,239
okay uh next slide please

2409
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:18,639
so this is a really short document that

2410
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,119
defines a way for a server to

2411
01:37:18,639 --> 01:37:22,800
indicate to a client that when it's

2412
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:24,320
going to redirect something

2413
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,239
and it knows something about the

2414
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:28,480
resource that's been requested

2415
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:30,799
then it will include that information in

2416
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:33,040
the body of the response

2417
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,880
we have a few different use cases here

2418
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:36,480
two of them are the ones that are

2419
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,880
motivating this work

2420
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:40,559
and the other two are things we might

2421
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,760
think things we think are used may be

2422
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,719
useful for some people

2423
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:46,560
so the first one is when the redirector

2424
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:49,920
has useful less specific

2425
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:52,320
information so for us we delegate large

2426
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,920
blocks to national registries and then

2427
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,480
they make delegations out of those

2428
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,119
blocks

2429
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:58,959
to their own account holders currently

2430
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:00,719
if somebody does an art app query

2431
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:02,080
they'll get information back about those

2432
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,080
smaller delegations

2433
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,760
but it can be useful to know about the

2434
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,480
delegation that we made to the national

2435
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,159
registry

2436
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,718
as well um

2437
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:13,599
the second case is when the redirector

2438
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,280
conforms to

2439
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:19,360
an external profile if the client wants

2440
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:21,280
responses that conform to that profile

2441
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:22,960
and is happy to live with the

2442
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:24,800
less specific information that the

2443
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:26,800
redirector has

2444
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:28,840
then they have options in that space and

2445
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,440
that's useful for us

2446
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:34,000
because uh we the regional registries

2447
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:36,080
are working on an adap response profile

2448
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,159
but it can be tricky in some cases to

2449
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:39,760
mandate compliance from the registries

2450
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:41,920
we delegate resources to

2451
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:44,080
so this giveaway gives options to

2452
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,520
clients in that respect

2453
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:47,040
the third use case is when the

2454
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,639
redirector and the target have differing

2455
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,280
information about the resource

2456
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:52,320
so the client can combine the two

2457
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:55,360
responses to get

2458
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:57,440
a fuller picture of what's going on and

2459
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,480
the fourth is similar to the second one

2460
01:38:57,440 --> 01:39:02,239
in that if the target is unavailable and

2461
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:04,000
the client is willing to live with the

2462
01:39:02,239 --> 01:39:06,320
less specific information

2463
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,960
then they can fall back onto that next

2464
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,960
slide please

2465
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,840
the first question is whether this is

2466
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:16,800
even permitted it's kind of unusual

2467
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,480
to return a substantive body in an http

2468
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,760
redirect

2469
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:24,799
the first document is 7231 http

2470
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:26,000
semantics and content for all the codes

2471
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:29,920
that are relevant to rdap

2472
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:32,080
so that's 301 302 303 and 307

2473
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,040
this document has text along the lines

2474
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:37,040
of

2475
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,920
a server will will usually or ought to

2476
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:41,519
include html with a link to the target

2477
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,600
resource

2478
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,360
but none of that text is normative and

2479
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,520
there's also no text that says

2480
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:49,119
for example don't return substantive

2481
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:51,600
content in a redirect

2482
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:52,239
so it appears to be okay as against this

2483
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,840
document

2484
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:58,000
next slide please

2485
01:39:55,840 --> 01:40:00,400
the second relevant document is 7480

2486
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
which is the rdap http one

2487
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:03,759
this one's a little bit more interesting

2488
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,239
because it

2489
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,800
clearly has in mind a model for adapt

2490
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,638
where

2491
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,920
there's a single answer to every query

2492
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,080
the server either

2493
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,600
answers or it doesn't answer or it

2494
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:17,360
redirects

2495
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:19,040
um however there is well

2496
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,799
in a way this isn't really returning the

2497
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,159
answer it's returning information that's

2498
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:25,119
related to the answer

2499
01:40:22,159 --> 01:40:25,759
so we think it's distinguishable um from

2500
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,559
the current

2501
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,760
text in the document and there's also

2502
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,320
nothing normative here

2503
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:32,960
that would prevent returning this body

2504
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:35,599
but it is

2505
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:38,080
it's an arguable issue for this one next

2506
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,080
slide please

2507
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,880
the document as it stands doesn't have

2508
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,440
any client signaling

2509
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,119
if a server supports this then it always

2510
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,839
returns

2511
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:50,239
the content that it has if it's

2512
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,000
redirecting

2513
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:53,519
there are two reasons for this the first

2514
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,119
one is that when you have a chain of

2515
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,400
redirects there's no need

2516
01:40:55,119 --> 01:41:00,400
for each server to pass on the signal

2517
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,519
and the second is that without signaling

2518
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,440
this is

2519
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,440
all just the property of the response

2520
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,519
and it might be possible to skip

2521
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,360
the ietf process and just register this

2522
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:11,840
as not app extension

2523
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:11,839
next slide

2524
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:18,000
some related work is the entity id to

2525
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,440
rdap server document which

2526
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,360
was presented by mark blanchet at ietf

2527
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:26,000
104

2528
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,639
that document had in mind a model where

2529
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,560
the

2530
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,639
rdap server that was responding to a

2531
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,159
query could include a pointer to another

2532
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,840
server that would provide

2533
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:36,320
additional information and that was

2534
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:40,400
motivated by the thin domain registry

2535
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:42,320
use case where the registry would

2536
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:44,559
return some information about the

2537
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:45,599
resource but also include a pointer to

2538
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:48,800
the registrar

2539
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:51,760
who would have some other information

2540
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,360
so that uh explicitly addressed the idea

2541
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,800
of having the client

2542
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:58,960
combine two responses into one

2543
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,400
but there wasn't much discussion after

2544
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,119
that was presented

2545
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,119
next slide please

2546
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,679
so apart from the question you know

2547
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,400
whether this is a good idea

2548
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:11,920
uh we have a few uh issues we like

2549
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,400
feedback on the first one is

2550
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,480
can this be registered as an extension

2551
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:19,839
at least based on the text of the

2552
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:23,119
relevant documents it appears to be okay

2553
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:25,199
um but we're sort of a little bit

2554
01:42:23,119 --> 01:42:26,960
cautious because

2555
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:28,480
because of how this is a little bit

2556
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,600
different from how artif

2557
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,320
is sort of put together as a single

2558
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,080
answer model

2559
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,840
so it would be interesting to know what

2560
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:38,080
people thought about that

2561
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:39,520
um whether this is useful in the domain

2562
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,080
namespace

2563
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:42,880
presumably not but if anybody is

2564
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:45,199
thinking about

2565
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,639
delegating to a domain name holder so

2566
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:49,599
they can answer queries for

2567
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:50,960
subdomains that will be interesting and

2568
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,960
the last one is whether

2569
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:54,840
this should have client signaling for

2570
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,840
some reason

2571
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,840
thanks

2572
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,959
thanks tom any questions or comments

2573
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,959
from anyone

2574
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,239
so they ask again here is um about

2575
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:12,560
whether or not the working group wants

2576
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:16,000
to adopt this work

2577
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:19,040
and uh you know consider uh

2578
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,040
moving forward with it

2579
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:27,280
and i'm good sorry um

2580
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,040
if nobody has any issue with this being

2581
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,239
registered as an extension then we can

2582
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:32,400
just do that

2583
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,400
so

2584
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:39,679
well the question would be whether you

2585
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:43,119
want it to be

2586
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:46,480
a uh standard or not

2587
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:48,639
um extensions you know can just be uh

2588
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,320
registered by anyone uh you know

2589
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,080
specification required it just gets

2590
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:54,559
expert review um

2591
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,840
and then it goes forward but if you're

2592
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,600
thinking it ought to be

2593
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:58,960
a standard extension and be on the

2594
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,800
standard track then it would need to

2595
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:05,199
come into the working group

2596
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:06,960
um so tom yes

2597
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:08,480
what we're interested in is if anybody

2598
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,159
had any concerns about this being

2599
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:12,718
registered as an extension

2600
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,719
basically

2601
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:18,839
okay so you're not actually necessarily

2602
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:20,239
requesting working good adoption that's

2603
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:24,080
fine

2604
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:25,440
alex go ahead please uh quite explicitly

2605
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,440
i have no concerns about it

2606
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:30,320
i think it's useful uh please go ahead

2607
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:34,400
and register it via the standard

2608
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:37,920
extension mechanism

2609
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:41,040
thanks alex gavin go ahead please

2610
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:44,080
um yeah sorry um i

2611
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:45,600
i well sorry i i i may have missed this

2612
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:47,280
in this presentation but there are

2613
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:49,920
other regional registries where where

2614
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:51,040
this is a requirement and and

2615
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,960
is there going to are there going to be

2616
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:54,320
multiple implementations of this

2617
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,800
at the at the highest level at the

2618
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:59,759
regional internet registry level

2619
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,639
um as far as i know the only two

2620
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,320
registries that

2621
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:05,280
delegate to um sub registries within

2622
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:09,440
their regions are

2623
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:11,040
us and laknik so

2624
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:17,839
i'm not sure if the others have plans to

2625
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:17,840
do any delegation

2626
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:23,119
uh gavin i assume that's an old hand

2627
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,519
okay any other questions or comments for

2628
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:25,519
anyone

2629
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:33,360
all right then

2630
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:35,519
with that let's go back to our

2631
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,480
chair slides here i believe that takes

2632
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,520
us through the

2633
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:42,959
uh new work adoption requests

2634
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:44,639
um so uh you know these are just

2635
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:45,920
opportunities for the working group to

2636
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:48,239
continue to move forward

2637
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,880
uh some new issues have come up and so

2638
01:45:48,239 --> 01:45:52,879
this is the perfect opportunity to move

2639
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:55,280
into a discussion of our milestones and

2640
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:58,480
what work we do have on our list here

2641
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,880
and what all of that means so

2642
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,400
this is just a quick picture of what our

2643
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,080
milestones currently

2644
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:07,360
look like just so that people can

2645
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,920
remember

2646
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:11,599
the rdap reverse search and the registry

2647
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,480
maintenance and federated authentication

2648
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,119
of the rdap

2649
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:17,040
are still there on our milestone list

2650
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,960
you can see that the rdap reverse search

2651
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,440
is woefully behind

2652
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,880
so we certainly ought to consider moving

2653
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,440
forward

2654
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,080
that particular milestone date if we're

2655
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:28,239
going to pick

2656
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,920
and continue that work that's already

2657
01:46:28,239 --> 01:46:31,280
working group work and it's already on

2658
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,040
our list here

2659
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,719
um the next four up there have check

2660
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:34,960
marks by them and that's because they

2661
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:37,520
are

2662
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,239
imminently or already you know in the

2663
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,440
queue to be

2664
01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:43,119
published so they're going to move off

2665
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,919
of our milestone list

2666
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:46,799
imminently here and so we don't need to

2667
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,639
to worry about

2668
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:53,040
us being full at the moment

2669
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,719
and then i observe here for completeness

2670
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:55,920
that the simple registration reporting

2671
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,760
in fact does not actually have a

2672
01:46:55,920 --> 01:47:02,080
milestone listed yet

2673
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:03,840
um and so i just uh speaking for myself

2674
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,880
i put a suggestion there

2675
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:08,719
for a milestone date i would ask that

2676
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,600
the federated authentication

2677
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:13,040
uh as a chair um asked forward that we

2678
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,760
probably need to push that one forward

2679
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,239
again

2680
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:17,199
we've been carrying that waiting for you

2681
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:20,799
know some uh

2682
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:22,559
uh work to start in in in icann um

2683
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,320
you know uh some interoperability

2684
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,920
testing and work there

2685
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:27,840
to start to move that forward although

2686
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,800
as scott noticed earlier in our meeting

2687
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:30,639
here today

2688
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,400
uh maybe we have a different motivation

2689
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:35,360
for moving forward with that work

2690
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:38,000
uh nonetheless we do have to consider

2691
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:40,400
moving that milestone forward

2692
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,760
as a last reminder here and then we'll

2693
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,360
see what discussion we get from the

2694
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,760
working group on this

2695
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,799
in in general uh we've always kind of

2696
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:50,000
had this model

2697
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:53,600
of approximately seven uh work

2698
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,639
items on our list at a time and that's

2699
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,960
approximately

2700
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:57,840
you know three work items on the rdap

2701
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:00,880
side

2702
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:03,199
uh three work items on the registry side

2703
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:05,119
um and then you know we have an extra

2704
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,879
one that could be on either side

2705
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:09,280
the federated authentication has been

2706
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:12,080
kind of filling that extra one slot

2707
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:13,199
um so you know of the work items that

2708
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:15,440
have been proposed

2709
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:18,159
i i think the numbers work out in our

2710
01:48:15,440 --> 01:48:19,919
favor here in terms of taking them on uh

2711
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:20,960
but nonetheless there's a priority

2712
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,719
question

2713
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:24,400
uh which we'll decide as part of

2714
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:25,920
milestone dates

2715
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,159
so that's just something to keep in mind

2716
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:31,520
as we work out what we want to do here

2717
01:48:28,159 --> 01:48:34,559
um and and where to go so uh let me

2718
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,239
first uh go back over to antoine here

2719
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:37,600
to uh you want to jump in here about the

2720
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:40,080
milestone list

2721
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,960
and um then folks if you want to say

2722
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:42,639
anything in the

2723
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:45,280
in the you know jump in for a discussion

2724
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:47,199
here um and add any comments about what

2725
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,119
to do here going forward

2726
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:51,119
any final comments about what work to

2727
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:54,480
adopt or not adopt or

2728
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:57,280
status of anything antoine

2729
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,759
uh well jim you already said everything

2730
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,679
that

2731
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,199
i wanted to say too you know we have

2732
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:05,040
slots available

2733
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:06,879
and people can suggest a new work

2734
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:10,159
uh the process we do this of course is

2735
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:12,320
that this

2736
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:14,239
we can discuss it here but the request

2737
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,440
will be made on the mailing list

2738
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:19,598
and please make sure that when you want

2739
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,759
to have a document adopted

2740
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:22,960
please let the chairs know we will issue

2741
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:24,639
a formal

2742
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:26,960
call for adoption on the mailing list

2743
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:28,800
for the documents

2744
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:31,599
where the decision will be made but i'm

2745
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:35,679
happy to have any sort of discussion

2746
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,679
on which direction we want to go

2747
01:49:41,119 --> 01:49:45,119
does anyone have any suggestions

2748
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:54,560
alec go ahead please

2749
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,800
given how small our working group is i'm

2750
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,639
wondering whether it would be more

2751
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,040
efficient to like concentrate on a

2752
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:05,119
smaller number of documents at a time

2753
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,800
and three to get them through in like a

2754
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:10,159
shorter period of time

2755
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:12,880
rather than like keeping seven documents

2756
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:14,320
open i mean yeah it's just a

2757
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:16,159
consideration that's it's essentially

2758
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,639
the same that we're trying to do in

2759
01:50:16,159 --> 01:50:19,280
my team that we have the feeling that

2760
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:23,119
addressing

2761
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:26,800
less issues at the same time leads to

2762
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:30,799
shorter uh q completion time

2763
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:33,920
so i'm i'm i'm unsure but but

2764
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,679
typically i tend towards less items but

2765
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:39,520
but completing them in a shorter time

2766
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,960
frame maybe then we have we have uh

2767
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,800
we can have shorter periods between

2768
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:45,280
milestones in the first place yeah

2769
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:47,119
if we address something so exactly if we

2770
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,599
like say okay the only thing we want to

2771
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:51,679
achieve

2772
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:53,360
until march 2021 uh is the art up search

2773
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:56,320
at the simple registration reporting we

2774
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:56,320
might probably make that

2775
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,040
yes and and the question of course alex

2776
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:02,719
is you know

2777
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,840
the the four items that have been

2778
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:08,400
brought up to the working group now

2779
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,280
um i think they will all uh start asking

2780
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:12,320
for adoption

2781
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:14,880
but work is being done on these issues

2782
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:17,040
anyway regardless of whether we put it

2783
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:19,520
on our milestone list or not

2784
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:20,639
um it's it's just of you know the formal

2785
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,520
process of

2786
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:24,880
adopting it to adopt into adopting it to

2787
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:28,000
the working group

2788
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,520
and to set milestones for it

2789
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,360
do we have another remark from james

2790
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:33,520
james go ahead

2791
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:34,559
well before jim goes just to add

2792
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,719
something to

2793
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,320
to that i i think you know this working

2794
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:41,840
group has always struggled with

2795
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:43,040
whether or not um uh with the fact that

2796
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:45,920
there's only a few of us

2797
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,560
i i think alex you know whether or not

2798
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,119
we take

2799
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,239
documents on board one at a time and

2800
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:52,559
work them forward

2801
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:54,239
is really not it's really only an

2802
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,320
administrative difference

2803
01:51:54,239 --> 01:51:57,839
with take all the documents on board at

2804
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,639
least label them as working group

2805
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,119
documents

2806
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,560
and you set the milestone list out so

2807
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:04,239
that you order them in the way in which

2808
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:06,159
you're going to do them so in theory you

2809
01:52:04,239 --> 01:52:08,879
only work on them one at a time

2810
01:52:06,159 --> 01:52:10,400
um but again as you say you know

2811
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,800
wherever the working group wants to do

2812
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,719
it

2813
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:14,560
we've sort of taken the approach so far

2814
01:52:12,719 --> 01:52:17,040
that we tend to take them on

2815
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,080
and then try to move them forward a

2816
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:20,639
little bit at a time

2817
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:22,480
but um whatever we think we want to try

2818
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:25,920
is certainly what we'll do

2819
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:31,199
on our side as chairs so uh

2820
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:35,199
yeah so now over to you jim

2821
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:38,799
say that uh having a mix of

2822
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:42,480
graphs like rdap epp and data format

2823
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:45,520
uh drafts uh helps um so you would want

2824
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:48,638
to have them all in art app or all epp

2825
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:51,040
or to be able to

2826
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:52,719
have it scale because i think there's

2827
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:59,840
different folks in the working group

2828
01:52:52,719 --> 01:52:59,840
that are focused in different areas so

2829
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,520
right thanks jim that's a good point too

2830
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,639
one of the reasons for having multiple

2831
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,880
documents

2832
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,560
in play at the same time is because yeah

2833
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:10,000
we're a small group but

2834
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,679
one or two people you know will

2835
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,239
typically work on each document

2836
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:16,080
and there's not a lot of overlap there

2837
01:53:14,239 --> 01:53:19,119
in in that as far as

2838
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:21,840
progressing work is concerned

2839
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,839
alex go ahead

2840
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:27,199
thank you jim um another another work

2841
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:29,040
mode that i've seen in a lot of working

2842
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:31,598
groups is that as soon as the document

2843
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:33,519
is being requested to adopt it the the

2844
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:34,239
working group chairs actually asked

2845
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:37,280
crowd

2846
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:41,040
uh i will take five names of people who

2847
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:43,040
are committing to work on that um

2848
01:53:41,040 --> 01:53:44,639
that has proved successful though in a

2849
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,719
little bit larger working groups i'm

2850
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:47,119
afraid that if we do that here it might

2851
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,880
be the

2852
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:51,519
same five names on each of the drafts in

2853
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,719
the first place we don't into lots

2854
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:58,000
so but it might be

2855
01:53:54,719 --> 01:53:59,119
it might be to to to ask people not only

2856
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,800
to provide a

2857
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:02,480
document chapter as soon as the document

2858
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,920
is adopted but also provide a set of

2859
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:05,199
like a core team that that actually

2860
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,080
works on the document that is really

2861
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:09,519
interested

2862
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:12,719
in getting the work forward

2863
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:14,239
yeah thank you alex i i know that

2864
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:15,920
when we started this working group we

2865
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:19,440
tried this um

2866
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:19,440
you know other working groups already

2867
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:24,239
they always asked for about five people

2868
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,159
who want to work on a document

2869
01:54:24,239 --> 01:54:28,159
we tried this at the beginning with

2870
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:29,360
three but we didn't always get a

2871
01:54:28,159 --> 01:54:32,159
response

2872
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:33,598
um where the authors still wanted to

2873
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:36,719
progress their work

2874
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:39,040
so yes we can certainly ask that during

2875
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,080
the adoption process and we always ask

2876
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,679
the question

2877
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:44,239
the question is what do we do when we

2878
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:46,000
set a limit of five and we get four

2879
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:48,480
do we then reject the adoption of the

2880
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,480
documents

2881
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:52,719
technically yes unless you like step

2882
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:56,559
forward

2883
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:59,119
okay i'll work on it as well yeah so but

2884
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:02,000
you know it's it's not an actual work

2885
01:54:59,119 --> 01:55:04,480
organization scheme it's more like uh

2886
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,639
you're watching the attention of people

2887
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:06,638
yeah

2888
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,360
into consideration that um

2889
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,719
while adopting a document we need to at

2890
01:55:13,360 --> 01:55:17,199
least to have

2891
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:18,080
a certain number of reviewers and people

2892
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:21,360
who are who

2893
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:24,159
are willing to work on the document

2894
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:24,719
thank you very much you have any remarks

2895
01:55:24,159 --> 01:55:28,719
on that

2896
01:55:24,719 --> 01:55:31,040
jim no i was thinking about reading out

2897
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:32,639

2898

2902
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,800

2903
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,480
