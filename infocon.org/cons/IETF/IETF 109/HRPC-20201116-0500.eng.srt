run through our welcome slides the

13
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
highlights of the agenda are we're gonna

14
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
hear a

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,799
talk from kim creighton um followed by

16
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
our work items so at the moment that's

17
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,520
draft association

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,839
niels is here he's going to help me with

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,560
that and um

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,759
gerschabod who may or may not be in the

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
call if not

22
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,000
we'll probably just all take a look at

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
the um the dock ourselves and see if

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
there's anything

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,640
we can glean from that he may just be a

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
little late

27
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,839
which is fine um

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
so yeah you've been here before thank

29
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,720
you all for coming to

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,640
um to hrpc uh we want to make sure that

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,560
you've seen the note well

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,720
and i'm not entirely confident that my

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
slides are showing up properly

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,160
um but since this is one of the first

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,400
it is actually maybe the first slot of

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,040
ietf 109. it's really important that you

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,959
understand what's in the note well as

38
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,200
far as intellectual property rights go

39
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
and also privacy and code of conduct

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
issues

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
so you can also find these anywhere on

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
the ietf site

43
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,319
um so the human rights protocol

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
considerations research group

45
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,839
is part of the internet research task

46
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,959
force so we're looking at

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
long-term research issues we're very

48
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,840
much curious about and exploring

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,799
the ways in which the human human rights

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,760
framework

51
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,760
might intersect both impact and be

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,959
impacted by

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,959
internet protocols and their

54
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
standardization

55
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,040
so we're not developing standards but we

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
are conducting research

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
that is relevant to standards

58
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,599
development

59
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,640
um we were chartered to

60
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:35,760
look at again how protocols can

61
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,440
strengthen and threaten human rights

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,440
and you can check out more on hrpc.io

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,440
so we have some objectives we want to

64
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,920
look at the relationship

65
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,640
between internet protocols and human

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,798
rights

67
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,839
we specifically mentioned on our charter

68
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
a focus on

69
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,840
two human rights the right to freedom of

70
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,679
expression

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,319
and the right to freedom of assembly and

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,319
association

73
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,120
we also want to propose guidelines

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,319
that's a goal

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,159
that was that has been here longer than

76
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
i've been here so proposed guidelines to

77
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,920
protect the internet as human rights

78
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
enabling

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,159
environment in protocol development

80
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,479
um we we've been inspired by the work of

81
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
the privacy considerations

82
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,440
or the privacy considerations

83
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
directorate i guess

84
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,719
although we don't have a directorate we

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,160
don't plan to have one for

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
human rights work um but it was an

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
inspiration so and then lastly

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,360
we just want to increase awareness both

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,039
ways so

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
you know talking more about human rights

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
in in the technical community

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
and being able then to make the

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,040
connections

94
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,159
and relevant um you know technical

95
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
developments

96
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
in the human rights community so that

97
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,199
there's actually a dialogue there

98
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
so far well these are the planned

99
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
outputs we want to work on internet

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
drafts but that's not all we want to do

101
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,960
we want to do policy and academic papers

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,960
um aubrey has talked about that in the

103
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,320
past i'd love for that to be on aob

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,159
this session or any in the future um

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,919
in the past there's been film and

106
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,039
textual interviews

107
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,639
and also maybe at some point in aob

108
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,919
in this meeting or another one we can

109
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,880
talk about data analysis and

110
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,880
visualization

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,120
of the current rfcs also

112
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,719
um discussion on the list that sort of

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,960
thing and what we can glean from that

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
and then lastly um and this relates to a

115
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,198
bit of the work on the guidelines

116
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,520
draft that we'll be discussing later we

117
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,720
do

118
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,799
from time to time protocol analysis

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
to assess impact on human rights

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,960
so specifically we've already talked

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,919
about the charter

122
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,799
so that happened that film was screened

123
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,198
and then also we've got an rfc 8280 that

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,919
was published so

125
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
that's our sort of timeline history but

126
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,198
bringing us

127
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
up to date we have two active drafts in

128
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
the past we've had lots of others some

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,960
have expired um

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
including draft politics but i kept it

131
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,719
on here or draft political

132
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,000
i kept it on here because it might be

133
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,520
relevant um

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
it's only recently expired and it might

135
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
be relevant after kim stock to talk

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
about reviving that a bit and how we

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,758
might do so but the main drafts we've

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,000
got which we will talk about today

139
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
in the second half of the meeting are

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,400
freedom of association

141
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,520
which has some nice update to it and

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,039
guidelines

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
guidelines for human rights protocol

144
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,800
considerations so that's it that is the

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,799
welcome

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,800
um i hope everything is going well

147
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
i do thank you aubry always so good at

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
this stopping me from just rolling right

149
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,400
ahead we need to pause

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,199
because we need a note taker

151
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,318
i believe the notes are very handily

152
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
linked from the agenda

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,479
so if we could get somebody in the chat

154
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,318
to just signal that they're

155
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,000
taking notes i think we'll all feel

156
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:17,840
better about that and we can move on

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:17,840
with kim's talk

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:31,840
any volunteers for note-taking

159
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,199
well since it's a talk um that's for the

160
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,840
next 30 minutes i might

161
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,720
i'll ask again after kim is done if we

162
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,039
can take some notes on the discussion

163
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
but i will take some but i would really

164
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,280
appreciate

165
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,960
if there would be others in the notepad

166
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,000
taking them uh but but so please

167
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
you know join me there thank you

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
yes please join aubrey um you don't have

169
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
to take notes on the next part

170
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,878
necessarily because it's a talk and

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,759

187
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,839

and you can tell me um when you'd like

194
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,880
me to hit the next slide

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
now this is going to be interesting

196
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,959
because i often jump back and forth so

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,279
i've never had someone control my slides

198
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,959
so

199
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,040
just be patient do you want to try to do

200
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,040
it if you no no no

201
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,920
this system is way too complex for 12 am

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
so i'm good right on i need to i need to

203
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,719
try again because i have the wrong thing

204
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
going on

205
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,600
give me two seconds

206
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
all right that should be showing now

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,040
do i just start yeah you can just go

208
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,160
i'm ready when you are all right um

209
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,040
hello everyone

210
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,439
um this after talking to mallory i

211
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,760
we had a brief conversation i was just a

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,760
passing um

213
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,880
statement and she mentioned the internet

214
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,640
and how people who are working

215
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
on the internet don't believe it's

216
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
political and i want to challenge that

217
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
particularly

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,519
it's easy to be apolitical when you're

219
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,920
the default

220
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,920
next

221
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,839
i am kim creating my pronouns or she her

222
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,320
um and that's my twitter handle as well

223
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,760
as

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,160
my um um website

225
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
next

226
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,519
i'm an educator so i always start with

227
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,680
defining terms

228
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,680
so we'll get started next

229
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,480
i um start every talk i do with

230
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,760
these terms because they um as an

231
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
educator i want to make sure that

232
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
everybody is on the same page and we

233
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,120
have the same understanding

234
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
before we move forward um so in this

235
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
sent in

236
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,439
when i'm talking about when i'm using

237
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,319
these words this is what i mean

238
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,160
privilege is simply about access and i

239
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,600
use this picture because i don't know

240
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
how many people have seen

241
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,200
um these monkeys that are in

242
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,120
this the warm springs that are in japan

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,279
and when you see them in

244
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
you know national geographic or whatever

245
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,959
nature show it just they seem very

246
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,760
harmonious and just all people like

247
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,719
that's cute

248
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,720
well actually what it is is there's a

249
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,079
matriarchal family that gets to be in

250
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,680
the hot springs and every

251
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,359
all the other monkeys are trying to

252
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,359
jockey for attention

253
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,399
or mating rights just to get in the hot

254
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
spring so

255
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,040
privilege is simply about access who can

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:28,720
use who can gain

257
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:31,040
who can be a part of next

258
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,000
is simply about numbers um you see a

259
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,680
picture with

260
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,640
um several men and one woman

261
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:46,000
she is underrepresented next

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,959
is about groups of people um so

263
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
um and how groups of people are treated

264
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,199
so it's not about

265
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,839
individuals um it is about um groups of

266
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,760
people

267
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,040
so in tech although white women

268
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,439
are underrepresented unless they are um

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,959
intersect at another unless they have

270
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,720
another intersecting

271
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,079
um lgbtq um

272
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,880
if they're disabled from um

273
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,040
from a community of color they're

274
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,360
usually not marginalized

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
next

276
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,560
diversity is simply about variety and i

277
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
use this as a and i know this is an

278
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,518
international

279
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,959
um meeting so i want to i try to use

280
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,279
um very generic examples so

281
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,279
you see here there's there are paints of

282
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
their cans of paint

283
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,279
various cans of paint that's what

284
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,399
diversity is so if i'm

285
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,920
um if i'm only given uh

286
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,399
i'm i'm told to to paint a picture

287
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,399
and i only have four colors that picture

288
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,079
is gonna look

289
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
and because i really can't paint that's

290
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,760
gonna be a very simple ugly picture but

291
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,880
if i've given

292
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,519
20 30 60 different colors

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,040
um i it may still be an ugly picture but

294
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
i can create some colors that i could

295
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,719
never create by myself by mixing colors

296
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,800
together

297
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,720
and or all kinds of things so that's

298
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,359
what that is diversity is simply about

299
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,680
variety

300
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,680
next

301
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,279
inclusion is about experience and you

302
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
don't get to tell someone if they're

303
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,800
included they tell you based on how

304
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
their experience your

305
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,880
community your organization your event

306
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,240
do they feel included

307
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,279
next inclusion is

308
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,920
not about equality um we in tech

309
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,120
like to have this false narrative that

310
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,079
everything is equal

311
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
when some people come in um when we and

312
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,120
we know

313
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,239
that people who enter spaces at

314
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
different levels

315
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,800
um as a black woman i do not have the

316
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,519
same power and privileges as a white man

317
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,319
in tech

318
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,399
so to give me something that's equal

319
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,399
does not help with my lived experience

320
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,399
does not help with my inclusion next

321
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,399
it is not about quotas it's not about

322
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,800
saying we need

323
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,639
um 10 people of color we need somebody

324
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,199
who's on the autism spectrum

325
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,839
we need somebody who has um who um who's

326
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,880
deaf

327
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,240
uh we need several lgbtqa people it's

328
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,000
not about quotas

329
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,720
next i just want you to

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,120
reiterate it is about lived experience

331
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,120
next

332
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,360
so everything i do um every decision

333
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,360
i make i look at it through the lens of

334
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,199
the guiding principles and they start

335
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
from the top down um tech is not neutral

336
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,760
nor is it apolitical

337
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,600
if you this is this you have to

338
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,800
understand this fundamentally before you

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,800
can get to the other

340
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,800
guiding principles once you understand

341
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,560
that tech is not neutral um nor is it

342
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,639
apolitical then you start to understand

343
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,518
that intention is strat without strategy

344
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,680
as chaos

345
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,079
there's so often that we're we have

346
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,199
these intentions to do things

347
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,680
and then we the impact of our intention

348
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,639
is has caused harm and that was not our

349
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,120
intention

350
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,920
but the impact matters and without it

351
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,959
strategy

352
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,800
it causes chaos um lack of inclusion is

353
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,319
a risk management and increasingly a

354
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,599
crisis management issue

355
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
we see often how someone or some

356
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
company's

357
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,440
behavior has caused a lack of inclusion

358
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,040
behaviors cause a risk management or

359
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,560
crisis management issue

360
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,199
and once you fundamentally

361
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
understand those you understand why it

362
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,439
is important to prioritize the most

363
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,759
vulnerable

364
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,759
next

365
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,359
for this talk we're going to focus on

366
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,399
the tech is not neutral nor is it

367
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
apolitical next

368
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,040
so this definition of political

369
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,720
is one of the um is problematic for me

370
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,599
it it it's it's on the surface it seems

371
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,440
um innocent enough but it's very binary

372
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
because it speaks only to

373
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
government and public affairs and

374
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,560
countries um

375
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,600
and it's it and it uses politics in the

376
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,000
word politics in the in its definition

377
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,680
and when people think of when you use

378
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,720
this definition

379
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,880
you only think of like political parties

380
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:28,240
or um you um how you

381
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,920
fall within political governmental

382
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,959
sphere and i am working on uh

383
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,079
redefining a definition of political

384
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,560
and so far what i have is um any belief

385
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,199
decision or action with the potential

386
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
to influence systems institutions and

387
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,479
policies because those systems

388
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,160
institutions and policies

389
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,839
impact people's lives we this

390
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,719
um is one of those a very binary um

391
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,880
the the definition of political that is

392
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,519
on the screen is a very binary

393
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
um extracts the human out of it and we

394
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,520
have to understand that

395
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,039
our beliefs decisions and actions if

396
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,760
they have the potential to

397
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,720
influence systems institutions and

398
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,879
policies

399
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
are indeed political next

400
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,879
so i was watching a new documentary

401
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,000
that's out called

402
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,120
coding coded bias and

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,400
um i saw this image and because uh

404
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,239
after talking to mallory i was like

405
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,880
where am i gonna go with this talk

406
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,720
and then i just saw this image and i was

407
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,520
like oh i think i know where i'm going

408
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,480
to go with this

409
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,160
go with this talk because this is where

410
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,200
um at the same time

411
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,400
that the internet was being um

412
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
thought about and developed so i need

413
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
you to look at this picture and we'll

414
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,199
come back

415
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,679
to to it later or a concept of it later

416
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,679
so next

417
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,000
and the person who um she was talking

418
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,678
meredith was talking about this

419
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,039
picture um in the movie coded bias and

420
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,679
she says

421
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,559
our ideas about technology and society

422
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
that we think

423
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,039
are normal are actually ideas that come

424
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,679
from a very small and homogeneous group

425
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,360
of people

426
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,120
and i really want you to understand that

427
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,439
because that is political

428
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,439
next

429
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,639
and when i was um watching this

430
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,080
documentary reminded me

431
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,760
that i had taken this coursera course

432
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,439
and if you don't know what coursera is

433
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,720
it is a open source

434
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
um open learning platform with a lot of

435
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,360
free classes and that's where i was

436
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,360
taking when i first injured tech was

437
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,918
taking a lot of my technology classes

438
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,639
and i remember taking this um course by

439
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,440
charles dr

440
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,720
charles severance and who um is at the

441
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,240
university of michigan

442
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,840
and that just clicked for me and i was

443
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,200
like oh let me see what's in this

444
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,959
and so what you'll see next is a a a few

445
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,200
slides from this

446
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,200
class from this um course next

447
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,559
so for me history matters and so that's

448
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,440
why i wanted to

449
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,160
to walk through this class so alan

450
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
turing

451
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
and you and and [ __ ] bletchley park um

452
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
when he's

453
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,439
we're talking about the development of

454
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,840
the internet um with cold breakers and

455
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,280
and

456
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,840
and um people who worked um in

457
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
in world war ii next

458
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,799
and so after post-world war

459
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,439
post world war two you have alumni from

460
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,679
the us

461
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,760
and the uk cold breakers working on

462
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,799
these various

463
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,799
computer processes either it was

464
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,000
hardware software building the internet

465
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,320
or whatever

466
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,320
next

467
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,679
and so you have this this reliance on

468
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,600
math and science

469
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,880
um both um broad-based investment

470
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
uh and maintaining u.s and and the west

471
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
intellectual lead now i want you to

472
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,918
think about i want you to remember this

473
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,159
intellectual lead

474
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,360
um and then you you have these

475
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,760
mathematicians that were

476
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,479
recruited you know their value recruited

477
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
brilliant

478
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
arrogant and quirky and then they talk

479
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,840
about um

480
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,840
the beautiful mind next

481
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:30,559
and so um nash was is like you know the

482
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:34,260
this this quintessential um

483
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,678
tech god and um

484
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,559
[Music]

485
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,039
and you know he's he's the story behind

486
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,200
um he's the person behind the story of

487
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,200
beautiful mind next

488
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,280
and so in this diagram it is um

489
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
the architects or the authors of the

490
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,879
opernet

491
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,879
completion report next

492
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,559
and then you have the in ncsa

493
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,678
and you have larry smear who was

494
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:13,440
um pivotal in um bringing

495
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,799
a super computer um to

496
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,000
um um urban champaign urbana

497
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
university next

498
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,760
and then you have the nsfnet

499
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,200
at the university of michigan um and

500
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,280
they were the networking part of the

501
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,640
uh of this super compute they didn't get

502
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,559
a super computer so they wanted to be

503
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:40,720
the networking part of the

504
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,720
internet next

505
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,280
and then you have um

506
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,158
this individual larry uh leonard sorry

507
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,000
and he

508
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,840
was the first person to do two packets

509
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,240
on the internet

510
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,240
next

511
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,640
and then you have robert and he was a

512
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,080
co-op inventor of the web

513
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,360
and so i st um i stopped

514
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,280
grabbing images from this um this

515
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
course for a reason next

516
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,840
next

517
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,639
because i wanted to talk about what is

518
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,320
the default because what will the

519
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,320
default of early technologies

520
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,600
next they were white

521
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,320
cisgender heterosexual able-bodied

522
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,199
western

523
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,158
christian english-speaking educated

524
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,760
fathers

525
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,440
uh married it was male uh white male

526
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,039
focus it was patriarchal and it was

527
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,840
binary thinking and then there were

528
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,200
other

529
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,240
but those were the main um that you saw

530
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,400
in those pictures uh um i would say that

531
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,919
the majority of those individuals

532
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,280
including that image of

533
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,480
the ai team fall in this category

534
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,480
and um next

535
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
and people might say why is this

536
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,080
important because the closer individual

537
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,880
to

538
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,639
is to the default the greater their

539
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,960
access to privilege

540
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
their ability to determine and to step

541
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,200
set the status quo

542
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,960
their um their chances of being extended

543
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
the benefit of the doubt

544
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,600
their feelings are prioritized the

545
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,159
impact of their behavior is evaluated

546
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,639
from the assumption of positive intent

547
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,240
and they expect and the expectation of

548
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,039
being treated with compassion and

549
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,360
empathy

550
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,360
next

551
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,559
the furthest an individual is from the

552
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,720
default the greater their level of

553
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,480
vulnerability related to the decisions

554
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,799
and behaviors of others

555
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,559
and that's why i wanted to i need i want

556
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,158
to um

557
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,678
re um define what political is because

558
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,640
it's not just the government

559
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,039
um so um and and then the instances of

560
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,320
being

561
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,720
impacted by unintended um harm

562
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,559
the chances of never being extended the

563
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,480
benefit of the doubt

564
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,879
their thoughts feelings and perspectives

565
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,640
are minimized or dismissed

566
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,799
the impact of their words and behaviors

567
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,360
will be evaluated from the assumption of

568
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,000
negative intent perspective and the

569
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,799
expectation of extending compassion

570
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,440
and empathy to empathy to others even

571
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,760
those who've caused them harm

572
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,760
next

573
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,360
whiteness is political and i don't care

574
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,960
where you are in this world right now

575
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,600
you can turn on any news show um

576
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,360
and you can see that whiteness is

577
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,678
political

578
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,678
next

579
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,480
so why does understanding this matter

580
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,480
next

581
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,279
because systems institutions and

582
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,080
policies are developed to reinforce

583
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,600
the default and i want to bring in um

584
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,199
before i move forward

585
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,439
i took as uh based on the intro that

586
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,720
um not even the intro mallory was going

587
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,240
through

588
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,279
um like the the your core values

589
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,840
are was internet as a human right

590
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,039
to have that as a core value is

591
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,678
political

592
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,400
and then um you had a networking and

593
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,760
standards

594
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,640
and politics that was um

595
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,520
i guess that has expired that is

596
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
political

597
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,360
those are systems institutions and

598
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,080
policies that are developed

599
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,320
and and we have to be mindful that those

600
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,320
are developed to reinforce the default

601
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,720
next

602
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,240
so i wanted to give you an example

603
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,480
because some of you may not

604
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
understand why i'm saying what i'm

605
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,120
saying because if you have an

606
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:58,399
idea that the internet is is um is

607
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,399
is neutral or is apolitical um

608
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,639
this is why i want you to understand and

609
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
this is why i love

610
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,200
his history is because

611
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,720
what i showed you previously were

612
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,640
white men uh when i showed you when you

613
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,000
saw the slide of the default

614
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,000
it was for white men and so people

615
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,520
um the narrative is always what other

616
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
people weren't there or

617
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,360
um they're absent and we see it in our

618
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,320
organizations now um people still make

619
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,799
these same excuses for why there aren't

620
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,399
brown and black people in these spaces

621
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,158
why there aren't

622
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,559
indigenous people in these spaces and

623
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,360
and without a historical perspective you

624
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,360
just think

625
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,399
they weren't there because they weren't

626
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,279
interested

627
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,120
um they had other things to do um they

628
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,039
weren't good enough that's usually

629
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,799
um one of the things that leads to them

630
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
when we go back to the definitions of

631
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,639
what marginalization

632
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,279
is it goes back to that marginalization

633
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,960
or they

634
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,440
you know they're just not good enough

635
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,120
but when you particularly and

636
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,720
this is why i took this route because

637
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,959
particularly

638
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
the individuals that developed the

639
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
internet were

640
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,720
in the us um in in in

641
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,880
um and right after

642
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,159
world war ii and we had

643
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,640
something in place called the gi bill um

644
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:26,080
right after world war ii

645
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:30,320
and as you will see it is

646
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,799
political and it ensured

647
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,559
all but ensured that only people who

648
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,760
were available

649
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,600
to develop the internet

650
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,559
were white people so um the gi bill was

651
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,799
to help

652
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,639
um qualifying veterans and their

653
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,720
families get money to go to

654
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,039
to get costs for schools and trainings

655
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,039
next

656
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,640
but there's been um some things that

657
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,760
people don't talk about the gi bill how

658
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,720
the gi bill's promise was denied to

659
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,399
millions of black

660
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,399
world war ii veterans next

661
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,520
and it was denied in in many spaces but

662
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,600
we're going to specifically talk about

663
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,960
um it was denied in housing it was

664
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,120
denied in um

665
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,559
the wealth wealth accumulation but

666
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
specifically we're going to talk about

667
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,840
here

668
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,279
education black veterans in search of

669
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,720
education

670
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,159
they have been guaranteed f fair

671
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,000
no better um many black men returning

672
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600
home from war didn't even try

673
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,520
to take advantage of the bill's

674
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,520
educational benefits they could not

675
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,399
afford to spend time in school

676
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,720
instead of working but those who did

677
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,719
were

678
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,240
at a considerable disadvantage

679
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,440
disadvantage compared to their white

680
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,520
counterparts

681
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,600
public education provided poor

682
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,879
preparation for black students

683
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,240
and many lacked um much

684
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,120
educational attainment at all due to

685
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,120
poverty and social pressures this is

686
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
political so when we talk about

687
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,239
who got to decide who built the dip who

688
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,199
built the internet

689
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,559
um when these soldiers came back because

690
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,559
and i'm talking about this specifically

691
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,760
because those individuals who

692
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,039
um who left bletchley park who were

693
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,600
at um mit who were at

694
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,799
all these great illustrious um

695
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,480
universities

696
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,480
they had a different first of all they

697
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,320
had this is why equality

698
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,240
we have to be mindful of equality and

699
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,520
it's we're looking for equity we're not

700
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,760
looking for equality

701
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
because in this very paragraph it says

702
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,320
that black students because

703
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,080
of the lack of education because of the

704
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,399
communities that they came from

705
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
they weren't even educated as many

706
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:45,120
weren't um

707
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,720
ready to work at that college level they

708
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,039
just weren't there

709
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
next

710
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,439
as veterans applications flooded

711
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,080
universities black students

712
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,919
often found themselves left out northern

713
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
universities dragged their feet

714
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,279
when it came to a meeting black student

715
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,240
and southern colleges

716
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,720
barred black students entirely and the

717
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,520
va

718
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,520
itself encouraged black veterans to

719
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,320
apply for vocational training instead of

720
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
university

721
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,879
admission arbitrarily denied educational

722
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,720
benefits to these students

723
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,080
so again i'm trying to show you a

724
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,120
through line

725
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,799
of why there are only white people uh

726
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,678
white males because you can't even say

727
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,279
white women

728
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,039
white males in these universities who

729
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,240
were getting to make the decisions

730
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,360
on the internet even the va was

731
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,919
encouraging

732
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,840
was discouraging black men from going to

733
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,360
universities and pushing them into

734
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
vocational training next

735
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,480
those students who did attend college

736
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,678
found doors closed

737
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,159
at every turn a full 85

738
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,200
of black veterans were shunted off to

739
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,600
black colleges

740
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,360
institutions that were underfunded and

741
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,080
overwhelmed by the influx of new

742
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,719
students

743
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,799
most were unaccredited and with a

744
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,360
massive influx of applications

745
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,480
they had to turn away thou tens of

746
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,399
thousands of veterans

747
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
so first of all i want to make sure that

748
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,439
i am clear

749
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,799
there's there was absolutely nothing

750
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,919
wrong with black colleges and

751
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,320
universities

752
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,960
except for in the united states we had a

753
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,039
thing

754
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,640
of separate but equal and these things

755
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,240
were not actually equal

756
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:27,360
the universities white universities

757
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,080
had far more um resources

758
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,678
and facilities and and qualified

759
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,960
educators

760
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,960
than on black universities next

761
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,840
through though congress granted all

762
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,158
soldiers the same benefits theoretically

763
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,519
the segregationist principles of almost

764
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,159
every institution of higher

765
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,200
learning effectively disbarred a huge

766
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,320
proportion of black

767
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,880
veterans from earning college degrees so

768
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,678
this is why again why i love history

769
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,960
because people

770
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,960
again have these binary

771
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,399
they weren't there because they made

772
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,080
choices not to be there they weren't

773
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
there because they weren't good enough

774
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,000
there were systems institutions and

775
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,840
policies in place that kept blacks out

776
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,840
of the university system

777
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
next

778
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,840
so next

779
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,840
who got to build the internet was

780
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
political

781
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
next

782
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,158
and since whiteness is still the default

783
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,720
throughout the technology ecosystem

784
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,720
the internet is still political

785
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,539
next thank you

786
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,539

discussion q a after presentations we're

790

not going to do that today

791
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,799
but there may be an opportunity to take

792
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,240
the uh the lessons the discuss or the

793
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,960

has

795
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,159
raised and started um and feed it into a

796
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,879
conversation about potentially uh draft

797
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,840
political

798
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,360
that is still you know a research group

799
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,000
draft but we're going to put that

800
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,959

853
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,799
introduction um the hrpc was chartered

854
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,359
to

855
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,240
focus on human rights and protocol

856
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,598
considerations

857
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,560
but two specific human rights namely

858
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,240
um freedom of expression and freedom of

859
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,599
association assembly so

860
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,598
this draft is um a specific you know it

861
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,040
was part of a specific road map for

862
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:55,920
this research group um niels

863
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,560
and gisela de accio were the first

864
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,240
authors

865
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,160
they um gave us a completed draft

866
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,359
actually from beginning to end well

867
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,200
researched and everything

868
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,720
but there were some changes that were

869
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,720
needed so we asked for

870
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,879
some additional editors along the way so

871
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,680
joe hall at some point was an editor

872
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,760
stephen couture from university of

873
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,118
montreal also was an editor up until

874
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,480
very recently

875
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,240
um and in that period of

876
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,040
just sort of revising the draft we

877
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,680
actually held three interims

878
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,640
just to talk about this draft um it was

879
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,359
mostly around

880
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,319
doing redoing a literature review um and

881
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,160
then at the end

882
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,079
the conclusion of that literature review

883
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,720
stefan moved on as editor

884
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,160
and then uh but but not before

885
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,160
identifying a

886
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,359
handful of sub-questions the

887
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,598
sub-questions

888
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,799
we stopped there and we thought we

889
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,760
needed to really answer the

890
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,040
sub-questions

891
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,160
with case studies from

892
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:58,079
ietf protocols and so niels

893
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,078
and i have done that since then

894
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,078
right so we've also changed the research

895
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,200
question a few times

896
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,160
actually meals um could you help me out

897
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,279
by

898
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,799
um reading the actual research question

899
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,520
because i think it changed again

900
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,520
i apologize

901
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,839
i can't hear your audio yet but this is

902
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,839
me putting you on the spot so

903
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,750
you're not you're on me at least i can't

904
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,079
hear you oh right of course

905
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,480
[Music]

906
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
go ahead

907
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,839
okay hold on

908
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,000
um yeah putting me on the spot no

909
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,160
problem whatsoever

910
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,640
the uh the research question

911
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,560
uh was what are the considerations

912
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,200
of the right of freedom of assembly and

913
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,839
association for protocol development

914
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,160
and that has now changed

915
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,160
into um

916
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,839
what are the protocol development

917
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,118
considerations for freedom of assembly

918
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,200
and association

919
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,320
so we made it tighter to stick more

920
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,759
closely to

921
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:10,160
the uh to the to the charter of

922
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:13,359
um uh of the research group

923
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,920
and we also tried to make the draft more

924
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,839
tighter to answer the question so where

925
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,520
the research was first aimed at

926
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:25,599
uh trying to establish more relations

927
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:29,119
in a uh in a similar manner to rfc 82

928
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,119
8280 we now try to narrow it down

929
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,320
and make it tighter also based on the

930
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,680
structure proposed

931
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,480
by the literature review and now we try

932
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,118
to answer

933
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
the questions in a more structural way

934
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,240
which would then also allow us to better

935
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
answer

936
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,439
the research questions and the sub

937
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,400
research questions

938
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,359
so now okay over to you awesome thank

939
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
you so much

940
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,200
um so yes and originally as well

941
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,960
the draft did not plan on offering

942
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,640
overall conclusions as far as i

943
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,680
understood we wanted to keep those

944
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,240
in sort of guidelines and out of this

945
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,520
draft

946
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,078
but because it appears to be a

947
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,759
full you know piece of research with a

948
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,040
literature review sub questions case

949
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,079
studies etc

950
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,359
it may also make sense for us to finish

951
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,079
this draft by

952
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,960
um giving some conclusions so that's you

953
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,079
know a tvd

954
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,720
on that but let's go into it first so

955
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,160
here's

956
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,160
where we landed with the literature

957
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,839
review here are some highlights

958
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,000
i actually really don't want to go over

959
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,279
them um but you can check out the slides

960
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,240
if you want to see what we found to be

961
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,800
interesting

962
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,598
um and you know obviously it's all in

963
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,720
the draft

964
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,599
but to to to say that this it was worth

965
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,439
going back

966
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,880
and and looking at the literature review

967
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
i've also had um

968
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,640
an offer from um

969
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,279
folks who work in the huma like you know

970
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,759
just for

971
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,119
human rights organization to to help

972
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,800
strengthen some of this

973
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,560
the footnotes we have so not to really

974
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
change the substance of what

975
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,839
we've said but to maybe just make some

976
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,640
of our pointers

977
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,599
um a bit better so we'll follow up with

978
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,598
that in the future

979
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,760
um these were the sub questions that

980
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,000
came out of the literature review so

981
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,160
things that were very clear some of it

982
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,760
was on the established side of like this

983
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,279
is the nuance behind freedom of

984
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,280
association and assembly

985
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,400
some of it was behind here's what

986
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,920
happens when you

987
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,599
slap the internet on top of a society

988
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
doing its best to adhere to human rights

989
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,720
and the things that fall out of it

990
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
so these were these were not necessarily

991
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
research gaps they were genuinely things

992
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,560
that we felt we weren't

993
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:33,040
wanted to be more curious about um and

994
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,599
so

995
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,800
in an attempt to keep moving the

996
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,160
research forward

997
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,040
we elaborated on these questions um

998
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
and at the last meeting at 108 we

999
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,279
presented these questions

1000
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,720
and we more or less as far as we can

1001
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,240
tell had consensus

1002
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,040
that these were the right questions to

1003
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,160
ask no changes to them no additions no

1004
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,560
subtractions

1005
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,359
um so go ahead and try to answer them

1006
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,920
and that was

1007
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,440
um then the sort of mandate that niels

1008
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,440
and i worked on

1009
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,119
so we did that in this in section six

1010
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
we're calling it cases and examples

1011
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,000
because it's not like a case study in

1012
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,839
which you would take

1013
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,680
one thing and start from the beginning

1014
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,920
and go all the way to the end and

1015
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,598
you know it's not it's not like that

1016
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,640
actually it winds up

1017
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,400
um using a couple different in most

1018
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,598
cases

1019
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,280
kinds of technologies protocols that

1020
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,880
have been standardized in the ietf

1021
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,000
to talk about a few different themes

1022
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,119
that then answer in aggregate the

1023
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,599
questions above

1024
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,480
so it's not a perfect one to one it's

1025
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,640
not

1026
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,000
always what we had expected we would do

1027
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,319
but i think it's quite interesting right

1028
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,240
so

1029
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,520
this is the this is the outline of the

1030
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,640
sixth section

1031
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,079
so first we talk about um

1032
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,240
the peace versus um

1033
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,560
peaceful versus unpeaceful or

1034
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,319
non-peaceful as it's laid out in freedom

1035
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,279
association assembly it's an important

1036
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,400
element there

1037
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,440
can we distinguish network traffic

1038
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,040
um as you know in its character

1039
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,040
characteristics of being peaceful or

1040
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,400
unpeaceful um

1041
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,800
spam adidas um so

1042
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,720
also on on agency so another really

1043
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,920
important part of freedom of association

1044
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,359
and assembly is the

1045
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,440
question of of agency does you know

1046
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,640
a member of this assembly or this

1047
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,000
association have

1048
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,000
agency to leave and to join etc

1049
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,760
so we looked at mailing lists and spam

1050
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,839
to talk about those things

1051
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,280
and then generally speaking there's just

1052
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,799
a lot in

1053
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,040
as you can imagine freedom of

1054
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,760
association in civic space

1055
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,880
so the ways in which um you know

1056
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,079
assembly

1057
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,560
and public space are used to

1058
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,599
um you know to enact one's civic duty

1059
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,520
and to be

1060
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,760
you know civic members of society etc

1061
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,680
whatever so yeah we found that the

1062
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,720
interesting cases there and examples

1063
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,720
could come from email mailing lists irc

1064
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,480
webrtc and peer-to-peer networking

1065
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,799
so those are sort of fall in that last

1066
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,599
bucket and that one thing that sort of

1067
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,760
joins them all

1068
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,119
together is that they're you know really

1069
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,160
communications that are happening

1070
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,599
between

1071
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,000
people with agency um so that's it

1072
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,200
we uh really encourage you to read that

1073
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,319
section thoroughly

1074
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,520
um i think there it could benefit from

1075
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,759
um additions and corrections if if

1076
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,200
the analysis is off based on you know

1077
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,119
people who are familiar with it i would

1078
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,480
love a bit more technical specificity in

1079
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,760
all of those but i mean i think at some

1080
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,800
point it just needs to be

1081
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,520
you know swept and and um edited we can

1082
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,119
take

1083
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,640
pull requests in github of course for

1084
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,760
any of that stuff um

1085
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,078
but moving forward thinking about where

1086
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,640
this

1087
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,880
might go and then i'll be done talking

1088
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,799
and i want niels to come in and

1089
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,160
offer anything else that i've any

1090
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,680
corrections to what i've said um

1091
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,839
we're thinking that we might actually

1092
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,879
want to do a conclusion section

1093
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,680
um so to

1094
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,280
um not to not to add more case studies

1095
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,839
although we could still continue to do

1096
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,920
that

1097
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,200
um it just seems like there's some

1098
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,960
interesting things

1099
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,960
that we could maybe pull out um and

1100
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,079
but but to be completely honest with you

1101
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,760
all we have i have

1102
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,240
at least i haven't done that yet so you

1103
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,200
know spent time writing out section six

1104
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,560
but i have not yet you know for me it

1105
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,040
would be printing it out on piece of

1106
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,160
paper

1107
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,440
going through it with a red pen and

1108
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,279
actually trying to find some of these

1109
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,800
conclusions and pulling them out and

1110
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,760
making a case for some of these things

1111
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,520
so if we feel like that's an okay

1112
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,040
mandate for the draft to have we could

1113
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,560
go ahead and do that or

1114
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,560
i mean i wouldn't say we i would

1115
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,160
actually welcome anyone in the group

1116
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,880
because this is a research group draft

1117
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,598
to step up and um offers do that

1118
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,280
so um yeah here are the things that

1119
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,800
maybe need to be done

1120
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,480
um in this in this in this meeting um

1121
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,480
but yeah actually before i do that i

1122
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,240
just wanted to make sure that we were

1123
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,680
that i was correct in the things that

1124
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,399
i've said and give neil's a chance to

1125
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,319
chime in with

1126
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,400
anything he wants to um elaborate on

1127
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:05,279
previously i can also move back a slide

1128
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,280
or two if you need me too

1129
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,280
no thanks so much mallory for this uh uh

1130
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,439
for this excellent overview

1131
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,640
i already saw a question in the chat

1132
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,800
about the interrelation uh with uh

1133
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,118
with other rights and this is something

1134
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,640
we also like reiterated

1135
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,680
in the draft that all rights are

1136
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:34,160
are interrelated uh

1137
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:37,118
uh uh inextricable and interdependent

1138
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,839
so uh we also talk about privacy in this

1139
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,599
draft but

1140
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:43,359
the the vantage point is also uh

1141
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,520
is of course the right of association

1142
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,078
and assembly so what we've been doing is

1143
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,720
really

1144
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,319
built the draft up from the ground on up

1145
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,640
because we've been working on this

1146
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,240
in this group for now for quite a bit

1147
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,480
and i think we made

1148
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,598
great progress but i'm really curious to

1149
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,720
hear uh

1150
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,720
from you all and if you think that the

1151
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,000
uh structure has improved so in the

1152
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,839
previous session

1153
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,400
every week we adopted the literature

1154
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:09,119
review so if we can adopt the analysis

1155
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,280
this time

1156
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,040
they can we can work on putting the

1157
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,000
crown on top of the work

1158
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,960
and rework the conclusions for next time

1159
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,920
and then hope

1160
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,520
uh we got a draft that is almost good to

1161
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,960
go so i'm very curious

1162
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:25,680
to hear from the people what you think

1163
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:39,839
for it about it

1164
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:39,839
perfect exactly yeah

1165
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,240
sorry aubry i didn't hear what you said

1166
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,000
was it

1167
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,000
i think you need to unmute yourself as

1168
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:56,400
well

1169
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,720
hi uh this is ben schwartz uh

1170
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,480
i'm not sure if i'm i'm not sure i'll

1171
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,839
turn yet

1172
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,920
but uh i thought maybe aubry said it was

1173
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:11,599
yeah uh i'll just say

1174
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,680
um i think i think this is is great work

1175
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:18,720
um this is an important area i

1176
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,960
i think that the idea of trying to

1177
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:25,279
determine how to design protocols to

1178
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,319
respect and support freedom of assembly

1179
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,280
sounds very challenging

1180
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,520
at least you know it in my simple

1181
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,200
interpretation where that

1182
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,759
implies essentially a forward-oriented

1183
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,279
logic

1184
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,040
where we attempt to predict the outco

1185
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,200
the effects that our protocols will have

1186
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,480
on the world i think that that that kind

1187
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,799
of prediction

1188
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,319
is is very difficult and coming up with

1189
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,920
principles for that prediction sounds

1190
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,079
even harder

1191
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,000
uh so i would in in the course of

1192
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,400
conclusions that you're drawing

1193
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,280
uh i would be really interested if we

1194
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,599
could

1195
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,359
see um conclusions that are a little bit

1196
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,520
more reactive

1197
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,920
yeah you know if we see a protocol and

1198
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,400
it is having a certain kind of impact

1199
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,040
you know how can we react to that and

1200
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,680
maybe

1201
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,279
make changes or updates that that

1202
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,839
improve things

1203
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,839
thanks

1204
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,839
thanks for that ben yeah i think for the

1205
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
that would be really good to capture in

1206
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,599
the notes just so that when we're

1207
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,000
typing away at the conclusions later we

1208
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,960
don't

1209
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,559
accidentally say things that are going

1210
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,400
to be impossible to achieve

1211
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,839
but yeah i think that's a fair point

1212
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,440
that i mean

1213
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:45,759
it's not necessarily so much about

1214
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,400
predicting or designing around it as it

1215
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
is for me anyway just having the curio

1216
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,440
like the genuine curiosity of like what

1217
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,558
are some of the aspects and

1218
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,119
characteristics of

1219
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,559
these technologies that have um either

1220
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,760
enabled or been an issue

1221
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,559
for um when considering freedom of

1222
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,760
association

1223
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:04,559
so i don't think they will be

1224
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,400
prescriptive

1225
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:13,839
conclusions i think that would probably

1226
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,839
not work anyway

1227
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,079
anyone else wants me to uh i'll jump in

1228
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,359
a second with

1229
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,800
uh of your comments if i can this is

1230
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,880
honestly

1231
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,880
um i'm really quite impressed with it

1232
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,359
with the direction this is taking

1233
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,400
and and you know the way it read and i

1234
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:35,359
just you know

1235
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,400
just reread it again before the meeting

1236
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:40,000
and

1237
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,599
while it it it's it's still moving along

1238
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,520
i can see the things that you want to

1239
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,160
add but i think it's really

1240
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,720
coming very close to a point where we

1241
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,399
have

1242
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,640
you know what looks to me like a

1243
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,400
well-balanced document that gets going

1244
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:55,440
into the issues and while there's a

1245
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,800
little bit more of the

1246
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,200
end in terms of okay so now what or

1247
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,640
or how do we look at it i'm actually

1248
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,200
quite quite impressed with the way it's

1249
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,920
going

1250
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,480
and it and i just wanted to mention that

1251
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:11,599
while we were talking about this

1252
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,240
thanks i do have some smaller points at

1253
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,319
places

1254
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,598
but mostly the issues i found were more

1255
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:18,000
editorial

1256
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,160
and and evenness of language and and

1257
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,280
things like that through the document

1258
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,399
but but nothing jumped out at me as as

1259
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,599
being necessarily

1260
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,200
problematic or or you know sort of going

1261
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,200
in in a problematic direction

1262
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:34,000
so thanks very much to all of you for

1263
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,000
all you've done on it

1264
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,640
absolutely well thanks for the

1265
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,400
encouragement audrey i think i'm really

1266
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,440
pleased with it as well and

1267
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,000
um like you know

1268
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,520
so thanks to um thanks to everybody who

1269
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,319
stuck with it

1270
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,440
um this whole time i think it's made it

1271
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,440
a better piece

1272
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,480
so um i think there's somebody

1273
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,480
so i'm looking at the chat

1274
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,839
um the protocol was asked what's for

1275
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,000
asking questions you can just go ahead

1276
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,359
and

1277
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,359
your mic on as far as i can tell

1278
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:19,839
we can turn it off that seems to be

1279
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:19,839
about it

1280
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,520
yeah it's hard to know i mean and then

1281
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,118
there's a so i don't know if i should

1282
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,200
read this question out or if

1283
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:38,480
ch would like to actually ask it

1284
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,000
directly but it says um

1285
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,839
i think the association draft would

1286
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
benefit from a discussion of resource

1287
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,160
and performance for example

1288
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,200
many services use big and costly servers

1289
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,598
to replicate

1290
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,960
messages to multiple people replication

1291
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,599
can also happen in a peer-to-peer

1292
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,920
network

1293
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,440
but it is limited by resource bandwidth

1294
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,839
of user connection power of user

1295
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,280
computers even time availability

1296
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:04,640
i like that so um

1297
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:06,240
yeah i'd love if ch wants to hop in

1298
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,520
that's a good question or it's a good

1299
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,839
addition as well something to think

1300
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,839
about

1301
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,240
this is christian with us what's my

1302
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,839
question uh brilliant

1303
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,319
go ahead yeah uh and it's something that

1304
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,960
we

1305
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,839
we found a lot actually doing the

1306
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,480
evolution

1307
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,160
of video conferencing networks and

1308
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,280
systems

1309
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,279
it's that it's doable but

1310
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,960
very hard to do this kind of stuff

1311
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,960
peer-to-peer

1312
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,800
because effectively you're dealing with

1313
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,040
a limited resource and

1314
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,640
it's much easier to consume what's

1315
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,200
coming from a server

1316
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,960
than to try to be the server for

1317
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,558
multiple people from your home

1318
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,760
connection on your home computer

1319
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,880
or your phone connection and your phone

1320
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,200
uh there are issues there

1321
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,960
and and the fact is that the more you go

1322
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,359
to the

1323
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,079
this resistance point the more you go

1324
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:04,319
towards server-based systems that are

1325
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,520
inherently under the control of whoever

1326
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,520
is putting up the servers

1327
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,440
and and that that's that's clear

1328
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,359
attention there

1329
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,040
if you want to do that in peer-to-peer

1330
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,920
you need to engineer your system you

1331
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,319
need in fact

1332
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,000
you you need to catch up a lot with the

1333
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,359
possible research in engineering to make

1334
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,480
that work

1335
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,000
and we have not been doing that and

1336
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,440
that might be something which is

1337
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,440
interesting to discuss

1338
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,440
yeah thanks for sharing that christian i

1339
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,319
think that is really interesting and it

1340
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,079
also then

1341
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:45,200
gets to some notion of access

1342
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,160
which i think is mentioned um

1343
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,919
certainly it's mentioned in the

1344
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,598
literature review it'd be nice if we

1345
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,240
could elaborate that in the case studies

1346
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,000
and maybe this is one way to do that

1347
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,520
access meaning quality of access and

1348
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,359
things yeah go ahead

1349
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,200
yeah it might be inter so i i'd be

1350
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,640
curious christian do you think this

1351
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,640
should be

1352
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,118
under peer-to-peer and conferencing

1353
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,520
because i can also i could also see

1354
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,960
how this would intersect with

1355
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,960
accessibility

1356
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,400
so do you think like performance

1357
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,079
considerations

1358
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,839
and impact should that be a separate

1359
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,200
heading or you think it should be part

1360
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,480
of peer-to-peer

1361
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,879
of web conferencing or or of something

1362
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,400
else

1363
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:27,839
because i also understood that

1364
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:31,359
processor cycles also were important

1365
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:33,599
vis-a-vis encryption and stuff so

1366
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,720
would performance and considerations are

1367
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,400
around that

1368
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,000
be a separate case and so what would

1369
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,680
that case be or should we

1370
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,680
integrate it further across the board

1371
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,799
i have to get used to that ui

1372
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,040
performance

1373
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:56,640
is mostly a problem in so much that it

1374
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,880
interacts with usability

1375
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:03,839
for example if you want to relay audio

1376
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:07,200
from peer to peer to peer to peer you

1377
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,200
end up with huge latencies

1378
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,200
and so so that and because you end up

1379
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,799
with these latencies your system is much

1380
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,640
less usable

1381
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,880
than one that goes to a big server and

1382
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,879
back

1383
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,558
so so and the same goes for video for

1384
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,160
the

1385
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,680
the the um the frame rate of the video

1386
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,399
or the definition of the video and

1387
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,440
things like that

1388
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,240
it also the other aspect which is also

1389
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,040
part of usability part of performance

1390
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,040
is the historic reason why we went away

1391
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,880
from peer-to-peer system as

1392
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:49,119
basically as an industry which is

1393
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,880
effectively that in many cases

1394
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:57,520
we are using now systems phones

1395
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,520
that are on only a fraction of the time

1396
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,200
and because they are on only a fraction

1397
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,160
of the time

1398
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,118
it's not a good fit for something like a

1399
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,680
a connection that

1400
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,440
has to be a peer-to-peer network that

1401
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,558
has to be up all the time and get

1402
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,720
synchronization and things like that

1403
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,920
so that's probably something that needs

1404
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,118
some

1405
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:21,359
research because i mean uh

1406
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,640
it is it's hard it has been tried and it

1407
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:25,759
has failed many times

1408
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,279
it's and

1409
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,520
and the alternative of courses have big

1410
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,040
servers and then depend on the goodwill

1411
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,520
of whoever is putting up those big

1412
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,520
servers

1413
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,200
um jonathan if you don't want to send

1414
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,400
audio i can read your question out loud

1415
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,078
because it's pertinent to this

1416
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,359
particular discussion and then we can go

1417
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,960
down the my cube but

1418
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:58,960
um jonathan says is there a technical

1419
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,720
reason that peer-to-peer would be slower

1420
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,720
it would seem that it should be possible

1421
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,680
to achieve lower latencies versus round

1422
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,680
trips to servers

1423
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,839
that might be to you christian

1424
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:51,839
i can't i can't hear christian

1425
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:19,839
yeah i don't hear anything christian

1426
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:32,000
okay but um chris lemon's replied

1427
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,919
peer-to-peer often creates a

1428
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,680
many-to-many situation where the total

1429
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,839
number of connections and transmissions

1430
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:40,078
increases with the square of the

1431
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,558
participants in multi-participate

1432
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,319
participant communications uh when a

1433
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,839
central server is involved often only a

1434
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:47,680
single connection for each person into

1435
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,880
the server is required it varies by the

1436
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,759
protocol of course

1437
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,760
i mean i need i think in just maybe to

1438
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,680
um

1439
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,200
answer your question nails or to think

1440
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,279
more about your question

1441
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:00,319
um and where to place it i do think we

1442
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,680
need a way of

1443
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:09,119
talking about how the manner of assembly

1444
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,839
may be very much defined by

1445
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,960
the platform of the protocol being used

1446
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:19,119
and that may be notable in

1447
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,599
the analysis across all of them i mean

1448
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,559
certainly in the last section so that

1449
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:27,599
would be let me get my slides back

1450
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,680
so here um 6.3

1451
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,400
it might actually be worth talking about

1452
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,160
the the quality and nature of assembly

1453
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,920
that's possible and how it's defined by

1454
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,799
the protocol or the platform and then

1455
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,400
that

1456
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:40,480
maybe would lead to an overall

1457
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,520
conclusion um of some kind

1458
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,359
but we first have to set it up

1459
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,359
in the analysis

1460
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,839
okay

1461
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,960
good infrastructure too i like that

1462
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,359
okay so yeah folks in the queue i'm not

1463
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,640
sure that i can moderate that

1464
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,640
and look i'm like i can

1465
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:18,880
only take people out of it well i'm not

1466
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,920
sure what we do and i'm afraid to click

1467
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,839
on one and cancel

1468
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,839
one from before i've not done this

1469
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:25,839
before

1470
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:45,040
i can't do anything is is me

1471
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:45,040
midoko folks um

1472
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,240
i think if you've put your hand up and

1473
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,839
you're first in the queue

1474
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,359
and it looks like dan is the first nicu

1475
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:56,078
i think you should be able to just

1476
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,078
unbeaten yourself

1477
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:05,039
yeah can you hear me

1478
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,000
yes yes it worked hey uh

1479
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,559
so thank you niels uh so i'm wondering

1480
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,920
you know

1481
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,079
i read your draft and i'm wondering if

1482
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:16,000
there's any sort of uh

1483
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,000
prescriptive uh

1484
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,720
suggestions that you you could make for

1485
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,039
protocol developers

1486
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,799
to to help with association i'm i'm

1487
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,280
thinking for instance like

1488
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:28,240
let's say a you know on an authenticated

1489
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,359
key exchange

1490
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,558
uh it would seem to me that having the

1491
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,920
property of

1492
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:39,920
of deniability would be useful

1493
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:42,720
to facilitate freedom of association

1494
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,559
and so i'm wondering if you can create a

1495
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,038
section that has some

1496
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:50,880
prescriptive instructions for

1497
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,200
protocol developers in the itf that we

1498
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,760
could as we're developing a protocol we

1499
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,960
can

1500
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,839
look back and say you know

1501
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,520
are we abiding by rfc xyz

1502
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:07,200
section you know

1503
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,880
a.z something like that uh

1504
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:13,439
i think that would that would make your

1505
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,240
make and resulting rfc be much more

1506
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,359
useful and

1507
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,640
and uh i would

1508
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,640
at least find value in that thank you

1509
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,359
thanks dan mallory will you answer this

1510
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,240
yeah i can i mean i think that we we

1511
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:35,119
want to

1512
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:37,118
be helpful and we want to

1513
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,440
come to conclusions that are useful but

1514
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,640
i don't know that we can be prescriptive

1515
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,920
i don't think that's

1516
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:44,400
actually our role in the irtf i think

1517
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,160
that

1518
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,119
um just getting to the point where we've

1519
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,160
you know made the connections we've done

1520
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,160
analysis

1521
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,000
and it seems rather comprehensive and

1522
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,279
then we can pull out lessons learned

1523
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,920
i think that's actually as far as we

1524
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:03,599
need to go um

1525
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,880
but you know i'd love for

1526
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,960
um this to be referenced you know if it

1527
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,559
is if if there's someone out there

1528
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,520
developing a protocol that might benefit

1529
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,039
from

1530
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:18,160
um you know referencing the

1531
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,280
this association work then that's that's

1532
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,480
great but i don't think we can be

1533
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,000
prescriptive actually

1534
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,680
i'd be happy if somebody else had a

1535
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,839
different view aubrey or niels or

1536
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,839
even colin

1537
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,440
you know and certainly can't be

1538
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,559
prescriptive about work being done

1539
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,799
in the idea you know we can

1540
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,000
you know do things as we've done before

1541
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:50,400
is you know

1542
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,680
the consideration type consideration

1543
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,640
type questions

1544
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:55,279
that one can ask themselves and and can

1545
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,720
even give

1546
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,760
indications of of perspectives one can

1547
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,680
take

1548
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,520
but but yeah being prescriptive

1549
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,038
especially being prescriptive about work

1550
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,759
done in the ietf

1551
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,640
we're probably going uh further than we

1552
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,119
should

1553
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,640
unless someone that does want to say

1554
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,640
otherwise but but i

1555
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,640
have the same impression thanks

1556
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,359
yeah perfect and yeah i i heard that

1557
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,160
loud and clear

1558
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,880
you know and that is in our research

1559
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,440
group

1560
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,400
title so you can offer up considerations

1561
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,680
cool

1562
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,680
so dan i'm going to take you out of the

1563
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,839
queue and mike you're up next

1564
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,279
you can just go ahead and unmute

1565
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:39,920
yourself

1566
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,920
can you hear me

1567
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:47,598
that's my audio yeah we can hear you

1568
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,799
awesome thank you um so i

1569
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:54,240
had a few thoughts here um

1570
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:57,599
one is that in response to

1571
01:05:54,240 --> 01:06:02,078
this recent discussion um

1572
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:05,280
it seems like it may be useful to

1573
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:08,319
um kind of spell out

1574
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,119
the different um principles that are in

1575
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,240
tension

1576
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:15,520
um and kind of frame it as

1577
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,399
uh trade-offs that need to be made not

1578
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,000
necessarily always

1579
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,319
in a protocol although sometimes that

1580
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,319
will be

1581
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,160
the case but also in you know

1582
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:28,160
implementation

1583
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,839
and adoption of those protocols um

1584
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:42,480
i think that uh there are a lot of

1585
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,480
like values and and um

1586
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,160
principles that uh are are in conflict

1587
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,920
and

1588
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:53,279
it's not easy to resolve that with a

1589
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,640
purely technical um

1590
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,079
you know solution in terms of like a

1591
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,558
digital

1592
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,440
um you know protocol definition that

1593
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,039
says this is

1594
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:08,559
how it must be done um and uh

1595
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,760
i think that part of the way that um

1596
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:14,799
we get there is i think it was um ben

1597
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:19,359
earlier who is suggesting that

1598
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:20,720
perhaps rather than being prescriptive

1599
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:22,480
you know we we have some more

1600
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,839
considerations to

1601
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,839
how to react to issues once they are

1602
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:29,759
seen

1603
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:33,038
um and so

1604
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,039
maybe that's uh

1605
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:40,160
the uh the way of doing that is to

1606
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:44,640
to think of it in terms of agency

1607
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:46,558
to react um

1608
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:48,480
in in terms of especially for things

1609
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:52,000
like the uh section on

1610
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:55,280
um you know blocking together and

1611
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,520
um like the roc

1612
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:02,160
use case uh i also think of like um

1613
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,280
mastodon in a federated model where you

1614
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,960
have

1615
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:08,960
um control at different layers

1616
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,119
um and you can look at that in terms of

1617
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,359
agency so

1618
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:13,359
uh

1619
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:22,238
i wonder if um that might be

1620
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:25,439
one way that we can keep it

1621
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:28,559
at the level of considerations

1622
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:33,678
rather than being really prescriptive um

1623
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:39,839
but also provide some some useful

1624
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:39,839
bits and pieces that you can be adopted

1625
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,399
yeah thanks mike that's a good idea is

1626
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:48,960
to

1627
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:50,318
um hone in on tensions and trade-offs

1628
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,080
i think that's a really good idea just

1629
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:53,120
to make sure in each sort of case study

1630
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:54,880
we've done that

1631
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,880
and see if there are commonalities that

1632
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,120
can be even conclusions

1633
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,319
i mean it's also a very human rights

1634
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,000
thing as well

1635
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,080
to look at tensions and trade-offs i

1636
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,158
mean that is you know there are tensions

1637
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,920
and trade-offs between um

1638
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,278
you know freedom of expression privacy

1639
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,920
for example and other things like that

1640
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,440
so it's

1641
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:16,960
definitely um not unique to this

1642
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:18,238
um area of inquiry so we will

1643
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,158
i think it's good to get that in the

1644
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:22,158
notes as a way to

1645
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:24,960
check that we've done our due diligence

1646
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,960
in all these sections

1647
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,879
i'm going to take you out of the queue

1648
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,319
if

1649
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:35,359
nobody else is in the queue so

1650
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,239
we've got we actually may not use our

1651
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,440
whole two hours

1652
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:42,718
um but before we end this

1653
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:45,439
particular section um just to

1654
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,000
let me go back to my last slide um just

1655
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:49,358
to

1656
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,799
ask for folks who may have an interest

1657
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,600
in this um to to work with us or if

1658
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,239
you've

1659
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,239
reviewed the draft if you've read it um

1660
01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:01,199
if you haven't please do that and then

1661
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:02,320
um go ahead and send any you know pull

1662
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:05,440
requests

1663
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,320
or or open issues in our github

1664
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:09,519
for hrpc um which is linked from our

1665
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,000
data tracker page

1666
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,880
that would be very helpful in getting

1667
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,239
this

1668
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,880
text shined up and ready for um

1669
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:20,639
ietf 110 in which hopefully we will have

1670
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,840
like a fully completed from introduction

1671
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,239
to conclusion

1672
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,040
and everything in between draft done for

1673
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:28,480
you all

1674
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:29,199
um for final discussion um what i'm i'm

1675
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,839
not hearing

1676
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:33,360
that there are any issues uh really like

1677
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,159
big large outstanding

1678
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,719
ideological you know thought-provoking

1679
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,679
issues

1680
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,120
with um the section six on case studies

1681
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,560
and examples so i'm really happy about

1682
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:45,519
that and i think it means

1683
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,880
that we should go ahead and um move

1703
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,960
uh for having this discussion i'm

1704
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:37,199
talking about the latest revision of uh

1705
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,880
draft guidelines i put the link

1706
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,120
in the chat if you want to have a quick

1707
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,640
look but of course you have all

1708
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:45,360
read them thoroughly just to refresh

1709
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,520
your mind

1710
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,120
the objectives of draft guidelines is a

1711
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,280
created document

1712
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,640
for human rights guidelines and

1713
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:55,199
considerations

1714
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,080
it's practice based and practice

1715
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,040
oriented

1716
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,199
so it takes off uh the findings that

1717
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,960
were found in rfc 8280

1718
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:07,599
it might seek to uh to update it

1719
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,000
because it has more experience and

1720
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,400
builds

1721
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,840
on that on doing your human rights

1722
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,719
reviews

1723
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,600
i've done that on doing uh doing

1724
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,760
interviews

1725
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,520
on doing reviews etc

1726
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,679
people were already pretty happy with

1727
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,560
the draft but then there was one final

1728
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,760
discussion

1729
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,360
on uh on attribution that we still

1730
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,880
needed to rework

1731
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:37,599
and we have done that now so in

1732
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:41,040
a previous sessions we've said

1733
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:44,480
well it is almost good uh for last call

1734
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,800
and that is why uh uh

1735
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,040
gurshabot and i would like to bring

1736
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,480
forward and ask if you all think this is

1737
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,600
ready for last call

1738
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:54,718
and hope we can uh continue uh with this

1739
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,960
document

1740
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:03,520
so uh rather short and sweet so the only

1741
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:06,239
changes that have been made was 2.3.3.20

1742
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,600
which is a very much a on the one hand

1743
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:11,919
on the other hand

1744
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:13,600
uh guidelines and consideration but um

1745
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:19,840

1751
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,080
sort of facilitation perspective what

1752
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:48,239
would be useful for you

1753
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,519
in terms of feedback at this very moment

1754
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,639
other than just sort of an open

1755
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,199
invitation to discuss

1756
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,560
like do you feel like it needs is it

1757
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:57,839
ready to go

1758
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:00,239
is it ready to go yeah yeah because we

1759
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,239
had achieved it is ready to go but then

1760
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,599
gorshebot said we should add that last

1761
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:04,559
point of the discussion because we

1762
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,000
reviewed

1763
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,760
before we said it's ready to go we

1764
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,840
reviewed the whole discussion

1765
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,199
on the list which were many threats and

1766
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,760
this was the only threat we hadn't

1767
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,519
covered

1768
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,120
so now it's covered so we feel that

1769
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,800
we've answered and covered

1770
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:19,040
pretty much everything that was covered

1771
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,040
in hrpc discussions

1772
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,400
and stuff that came up in the interviews

1773
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,320
and during the experience

1774
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:28,559
of uh of doing human rights reviews

1775
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,719
so this should be a practical document

1776
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,400
for people who want to do human rights

1777
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,600
reviews of their own drafts

1778
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:37,360
or the draft of others yeah

1779
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,640
and it's been because like the very

1780
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:42,960
first version has been

1781
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:46,000
out for quite some time since 2017 um

1782
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:49,679
it's been it's been put to use i know in

1783
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,960
practical ways um by various folks

1784
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:57,280
and yeah and it's on its

1785
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,880
sixth version so um

1786
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,480
i mean i can't imagine it being more

1787
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,800
ready to go that's the

1788
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,639
that's where i'm stuck so i in by by

1789
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,520
that that token i think it is ready to

1790
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:08,080
go but i'm happy

1791
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,840
to hear from my co-chair others all

1792
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,199

1793
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:13,760
ready for

1794
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:13,759
last call

1795
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:19,839
which is great so we should do that on

1796
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,840
the list

1797
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,280

can leave it open for the next

1836

01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,440
them directly to me

1850
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:38,960
and then we can get that

1851
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,960
item that was still on the back burner

1852
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:44,080
going again

1853
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,840
can i ask you um so this is maybe future

1854
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,679
work for you but it could also be picked

1855
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,199
up at any time can you just give

1856
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,800
for folks who aren't familiar with it

1857
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,559
can you just give the broad overview of

1858
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,320
what draft political is all about

1859
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,640
what it's trying to achieve it's

1860
01:17:54,320 --> 01:18:00,320
research objective

1861
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,880
uh thank you thank you very much mallory

1862
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,080
of course

1863
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,080
extremely brief i'm just kidding what

1864
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,360
the draft political is trying to do is

1865
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,400
trying to analyze

1866
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:13,599
what are all the different uh aspects of

1867
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:16,320
uh of standard setting in the ietf

1868
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,159
and so of protocols and standards and

1869
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,960
the process of protocol and standards

1870
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:21,679
making

1871
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,120
and thereby to understand how power and

1872
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,360
politics play a role

1873
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:26,800
in both the process and the outputs of

1874
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:31,199
these documents

1875
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:31,199
all these of these processes

1876
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:44,560
so it is it is a uh

1877
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:45,519
it is it is a similar multiple case

1878
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,440
study design

1879
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:52,080
similar to the um to draft political

1880
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,919
to a draft association but as draft

1881
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,280
association draft political needs to be

1882
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,679
cleaned up again

1883
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,880
so but maybe we could now now we have

1884
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,199
more issues and

1885
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,239
more things we could first do more is

1886
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:04,320
more parts

1887
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,678
and then restructure it clean it up and

1888
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,280
continue with that as well

1889
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,760
so that seemed to work really well for

1890
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:14,880
draft association so maybe we should go

1891
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:17,760
for a similar mode for draft political

1892
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,560
yeah i can see that um working really

1893
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,239
well

1894
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,920
like the formula for draft association

1895
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:22,400
seemed to work really well once we hit

1896
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,199
it

1897
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,080
um the only thing that i would say is a

1898
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,719
potentially

1899
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,400
slight drawback is that while freedom of

1900
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,679
association and assembly are incredibly

1901
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,759
well defined

1902
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,040
um because they're in the universal

1903
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,640
declaration on human rights

1904
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,080
political and the nature of what it

1905
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,679
means to be political is a little bit

1906
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,159
more nebulous but i think

1907
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:42,719
what we can do there is what i think you

1908
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,839
have done

1909
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:47,600
already um and what many scholars in

1910
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,480
this field would do which is to really

1911
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,320
lean on

1912
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,639
the existing writing about it and

1913
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:55,040
there's no shortage of

1914
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,400
scholarly's research that makes the case

1915
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:59,440
for this and

1916
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,480
what political means may be part of that

1917
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:02,799
discovery

1918
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:04,000
trying to explain it and talk about what

1919
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:06,880
political means

1920
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,679
um in this context in a clear way for

1921
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,639
people reading it

1922
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:12,320
might actually be very helpful yeah and

1923
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,400
i do hope that it could then also

1924
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,000
contribute to other discussions

1925
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,440
that we've seen popping up vis-a-vis

1926
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,920
consolidation etc

1927
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,599
so it would i think it could contribute

1928
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,920
and mix into separate discussions so

1929
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,320
yeah

1930
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,679
looking forward to that work if we can

1931
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,799
add that as an explicit

1932
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,480
goal of this research in some way um

1933
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,880
that we want to actually unpack what it

1934
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:35,519
means to be political i think that would

1935
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,080
really help people care about this draft

1936
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:39,600
more

1937
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:41,040
frankly yeah those are all

1938
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,639
great things that i hope make it into

1939
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,600
the notes and then once we're done with

1940
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:48,560
last call of

1941
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:48,560
draft guidelines get right on it cool

1942
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,560
abra you were sort of in and out of

1943
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:05,679
unmuting yourself did you want to jump

1944
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,679
in on draft political

1945
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,639
no i can't hear you though

1946
01:21:17,199 --> 01:21:20,000
is it just me

1947
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,840
can i get hurt now yeah

1948
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:29,840
no i lost hotel

1949
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:43,839
still there

1950
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,839
okay so aubrey's comment being um the

1951
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,239
draft political can look more in the

1952
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:01,360
civil and political rights aspect

1953
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:04,159
yeah i think that's i think that's fair

1954
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,440
for sure i think just even the you know

1955
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:09,120
the basics

1956
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,080
of uh one slide that i remember kim had

1957
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,320
in her talk in the

1958
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,639
in the beginning of it was just it's not

1959
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:15,199
it is it is political and it's not

1960
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,400
neutral

1961
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:18,879
and those are actually two different

1962
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:20,239
things i think sometimes draft political

1963
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,440
was just trying to make the case that

1964
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,199
things were not neutral

1965
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:25,199
but then taking a step further to talk

1966
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,678
about um

1967
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:29,678
the actual positive expression of civil

1968
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,800
and political rights

1969
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:36,000
now i also really enjoyed

1970
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:39,040
the the finding that

1971
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,920
kim brought really clearly to light uh

1972
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,960
that uh equality and equity are not the

1973
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,080
same things

1974
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,800
and i think it would be really

1975
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:49,519
interesting to to to bring that forward

1976
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:51,120
and and research that deeper into in

1977
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,120
this context

1978
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:55,599
i like that too i think that's a really

1979
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,599
good idea

1980
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:08,560
i'm pausing for anyone who wants to jump

1981
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,639
in the queue on any of these issues

1982
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,000
we'd love to hear feedback we can also

1983
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:13,440
take it to the list and would appreciate

1984
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,560
your feedback there as well

1985
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:19,759
on all these things and um

1986
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,960
again feel free to jump in on this

1987
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,400
in github where we take issues and pull

1988
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,239
requests

1989
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,839
and i think because we weren't able to

1990
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:28,480
it was just a bit of an awkward time

1991
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,320
zone

1992
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:34,638
for a lot of our speakers um and

1993
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,400
we weren't able to get a second speaker

1994
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,760
as we'd hoped so we're just about 30

1995
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:39,599
minutes early

1996
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,080
and i'm sure no one would complain i'm

1997
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:44,400
not going to complain

1998
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,000
it is sunday night for me still okay

1999
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:49,120
great david lawrence please

2000
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,639
go ahead you can unmute yourself i just

2001
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:52,400
had a quick question about whether we

2002
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:53,199
were supposed to blue sheet for this

2003
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:57,199
meeting or not

2004
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:57,199
in the cody or what have you

2005
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:03,920
um can i ask um for

2006
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,199
help on that one because i'm not

2007
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,639
actually sure how blue sheets are being

2008
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:09,759
handled at 109

2009
01:24:06,639 --> 01:24:12,320
if they if it changed over since

2010
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,320
108.

2011
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:18,239
colin go ahead yeah yeah the blue sheets

2012
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:21,519
being auto-generated

2013
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:24,239
that's what i thought okay

2014
