1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,480
okay

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,200
well um it is midnight uh

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
eastern time uh my carriage is being

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,400
transformed

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
in a pumpkin and i hope i'm not losing

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,599
any shoes but i guess in the meantime we

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,919
can do

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,920
uh computing in the network uh

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,080
and so good morning to people or good

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,120
night to others

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,280
this is again computing in the network

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,839
uh the three chairs are here jeffrey

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,520
here from the wonderful university city

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,559
university in hong kong

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,640
eve from intel and we currently in

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,280
montreal concordia university

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,280
next slide

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,079
so you can connect to us in many

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,280
wonderful ways obviously we have all the

20
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
meeting material

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
and the data tracker and you can get it

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,720
from there

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
there's another pad there's the jabber

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
we still don't have anybody to take

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,880
notes but

26
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,720
unless we have that in the next few

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
seconds in any way we can take notes

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,840
from the recording because all

29
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,759
sessions are being recorded uh so

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
please everybody and i think everybody's

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
doing it video is off

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
keep yourself muted unless you're

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,520
speaking

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,280
and uh there is actually um

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,439
that there's a chat and there's the

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
queue and there's also there's a slack

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,520
channel

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,720
that i created if anybody likes slack uh

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,039
which is also pretty much used uh next

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,039
slide

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,398
so this is the uh usual uh intellectual

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,040
property

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,920
if anybody who is presenting something

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,000
today

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,200
especially people from industry uh

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
please make sure that

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
you are uh very much aware that you

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,119
might

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,479
must disclose your ipr and i think the

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,880
big thing here is a timely manner

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,000
uh because in other research groups we

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,160
had problems with

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
the timing next slide

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
this is also the privacy and the code of

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
conduct

56
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
obviously everybody is expected to be

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,200
respectful

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,680
and um not harass people

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
or do anything that people could think

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,760
could be harassment

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:38,959
so this is obviously being good citizen

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,959
and in that case good netizens next

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,239
uh we have to remind a lot of people

64
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,680
also that this is the irtf this is

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
not a standards development organization

66
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
we

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,800
have a mandate of conducting research

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,440
of fostering research and i think

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
uh as the chair also of another research

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,000
group and this one

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,040
we have to remember remind i think

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
especially draft writers

73
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
that when they write a draft it is not

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
about something that will become a

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,599
standard

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
but something that should highlight what

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,518
is the related research

78
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
and why the research community should be

79
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
aware

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
of this work next slide

81
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,440
so coin who are we i i think i will take

82
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
just a few more seconds than i usually

83
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,519
take

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,599
on on this slide uh because of a

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
previous meeting that happened

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,679
uh yesterday for some of you and i think

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,239
it's yesterday now for me

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,760
and probably earlier today for others uh

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,239
our goal is to foster

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,840
research in computing in the network and

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,280
what does it mean that's what i think is

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,480
is getting to be interesting

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,120
uh our scope is pretty wide

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,560
and we put architectures and protocols

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,640
and obviously

96
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
real-world use cases application and

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,399
work in progress

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,599
and again this is research and

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
architecture

100
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,359
research and protocol and research and

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,120
use cases

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
for those of you who did not have a

103
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
20-hour day or had time to sleep in the

104
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,759
middle

105
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,000
uh there was this morning a um

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,479
well i guess it was yesterday by now a

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
meeting a side meeting on something that

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
was called fight which is future

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,240
internet

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,719
protocol evolution and it made me uh

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,680
understand because we were a little bit

112
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
we're recited

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,040
in that meeting it made me understand

114
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,320
that a lot of people did not really

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
understand

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,719
uh what what we were about so let me

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,840
take just a few seconds for that

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
uh we are about adding computation in

119
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,880
network nodes

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,560
we're not doing p4 we had hackathons on

121
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,600
p4 because p4

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,400
is one way to put computation in

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
some network nodes but p4 is not

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,000
everything

125
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,039
we're not about switches uh somebody

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,720
this morning

127
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,280
and um in the chat but well these people

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,400
are looking at programmable switches

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,400
yes and no uh we're about research

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,759
at in the network which is a distributed

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
computer board

132
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
and this computer distribu computer

133
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
board has computing

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,320
units and storage units and these units

135
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:33,520
are connected by communication means

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,400
uh this also

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,599
gives us an incredible amount of

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,359
potential uses

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,520
and that's where the research becomes so

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,479
interesting uh those of you who were

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,320
at uh at sitcom and those of you who

142
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
were at icn

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,159
uh could the conferences this year could

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
see that there was an awful lot

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,000
of research on this potential use

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,440
of this distributed computer board and

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
routing

148
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,639
uh which will be presented sharon is on

149
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,319
now

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,800
is one of these applications this is the

151
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,160
in the network of the computing and the

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,639
network

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,800
but there is also uh i don't know if i

154
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,639
don't know if lars on but lars and

155
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
davoran have raised the issue that we

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,720
could also be doing

157
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,199
computing on the network so once we're

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,479
done filtering packets and routing them

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,720
we may be wanting to do more with them

160
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,758
or to process them further for

161
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,800
applications in iot and ar vr

162
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,160
so we're computing in the network layer

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
and on the network

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,680
layer because we do that

165
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,080
it also means that we need addressing

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,039
and we need discovery

167
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
and this is also application and some of

168
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,680
the

169
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
semantic routing that was uh discussed

170
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,880
in the previous meeting

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
uh and so it means all this discovery

172
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
work

173
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,039
that was going to be uh presented and

174
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
goes

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,080
way beyond the original intent

176
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
of of some of the computing network

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
which was basically for data centers

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
so goes into also loads and in machine

179
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,039
learning and things like that

180
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,479
uh this morning when i was listening to

181
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,599
the

182
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,159
presentations it made me even uh

183
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,560
think back in my old days when i was a

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,080
an architect in telodesic which was the

185
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,800
internet in the sky

186
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,359
and for a long time we had thought that

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
um

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
that telodesic was the computing in the

189
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
sky

190
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,319
because we needed a lot of for onboard

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
processing

192
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
to compute the routes and compute all

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,680
the things that we needed there

194
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
so this was also computing in the

195
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
network but in that case the network is

196
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,080
really above our hair

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,120
so we welcome the research

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,840
that is related to some of the issues

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
that were presented this morning

200
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,000
in our use cases in our applications in

201
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,199
the work in progress

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,840
we welcome presentations and it made us

203
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,120
think also after listening to this

204
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,198
morning's presentation

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,639
that today we have an awful and awfully

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,840
loaded uh schedule with with

207
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:16,240
as uh jeffrey is going to present

208
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,799
nine presentations but that maybe

209
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
when we have our our interim sometimes

210
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,680
in february

211
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
we could have a longer interim and

212
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
actually really really

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
focus on research presentation this time

214
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
and

215
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,280
the people from five you're more than uh

216
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,080
welcome to present

217
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,718
so i think because of josiah said that

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
because of

219
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
what i just said i will probably take on

220
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,080
to me to update

221
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,120
the the description of the working group

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,959
uh on the data tracker to make sure that

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
you know there's no um

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,040
assumptions about what we do that is

225
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,600
something that we're not doing

226
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
so uh this said this was my this was my

227
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,480
spiel

228
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
and uh i will let it to jeffrey to

229
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,760
introduce the agenda

230
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,040
and our growing number of drafts

231
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,760
okay so we will

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,439
take a quick look at the current current

233
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,120
drafts and the milestones

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
before the presentation then the

235
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,160
presentation will start from

236
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,160
an use case ai at the edge

237
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
then there could introduce their

238
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,600
direction draft

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
which is has been accepted as our

240
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,760
working

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,080
research group document after

242
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,200
a pre last meeting then if we introduce

243
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
the data discovery and discussion this

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,279
is the following

245
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,080
the discussion in the last meeting as

246
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,200
well also

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,480
in the mailing list then after that so

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,680
ike or dirk the question will introdu

249
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,360
will induce

250
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,680
the another research group

251
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
document the use case they have evolved

252
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,599
from

253
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:03,040
industrial use case to a more general

254
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,160
then there's some updates for the

255
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,240
uh no so the there's another

256
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:13,600
uh presentation so that's from

257
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,640
a draft initially proposed to tsg

258
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
working group but they are just one use

259
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,640
cases

260
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,760
so explicitly mentioned

261
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:27,920
in that draft that is related to coins

262
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:32,399
use cases so we so they will introduce

263
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,760
their this draft briefly so in the past

264
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
related to us

265
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
so then there will be some updates for

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,959
the transport

267
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,680
document and the application centric

268
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,560
microservice and the security and then

269
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,920
finally

270
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,680
sophia will introduce their new european

271
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,719
uh project which is related to us as

272
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,920
well

273
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,720
so after that hope we can have some time

274
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,839
to discuss the future plans next please

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,600
if yes so this is a current

276
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,720
draft so we have two uh candidates

277
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
research group documents the the use

278
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
case is

279
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,959
not not specific to indulge or not more

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
general

281
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,760
and then the second is the

282
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,839
culture the conscious uh direction so we

283
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,519
hope these two research group documents

284
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,720
can contain

285
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,200
the insights or discussions in

286
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
you know in this group then there are

287
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
several uh

288
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,880
jobs will be present here

289
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,000
today and next time

290
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,279
before you go jeffrey go before again

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,600
i think we had gone to the to the uh

292
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,959
list about those two uh rg documents and

293
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,360
since we had no um

294
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,479
no comment about not accepting them i

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,920
think we can consider

296
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,519
that they are accepted so i guess we can

297
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,959
move on to those two

298
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,480
and then look at the others

299
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,359
yeah okay so these these are jobs not

300
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,880
presented

301
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,920
today including some new

302
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,880
uh drafts coming after last meeting from

303
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,479
from the second one and the third one

304
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,920
okay maybe we adjust this

305
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,120
later okay

306
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,479
next so this is milestones so for the

307
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,240
state of art

308
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,920
and the challenges maybe we we have we

309
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,600
have at least partially adjust

310
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,880
in the direction and direction document

311
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,360
and but we need uh more contribution

312
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,959
about the requirement and the

313
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,279
implication for

314
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,518
the network elements and for the use

315
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,720
cases we now have the use case

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,040
uh research group document and we can

317
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,480
discuss further on that

318
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,279
and okay so

319
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,920
as for the scope as we just say and as

320
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,560
we have

321
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,000
we have discussed this a little bit

322
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
right we can continue this

323
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
discussion about the scope of this

324
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,120
research group

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
if you have any suggestions for the

326
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,240
milestones

327
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,240
please let us know

328
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,079
and i think the intent of the um the

329
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,639
february interim

330
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,359
is really to focus not just on research

331
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,959
but also on scope

332
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,880
okay yeah all right

333
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:45,599
so i think that's it uh

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,600
i guess i should stop sharing if i can

335
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
um

336
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,079
and our first presenter

337
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
is sharon who will be speaking about the

338
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,680
ietf lisp

339
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
virtual routing for ai at the edge

340
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,279
presentation

341
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,479
yes hi good morning can you hear me

342
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,600
yes we can that's good can you share my

343
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,000
slides so i

344
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,839
don't mess up your setup oh sure okay

345
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,240
uh i guess i have to go back to the

346
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
sharing

347
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:28,160
okay no worries that was exactly why i

348
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,880
queued things up i'll share my entire

349
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,639
screen

350
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,639
here we go um

351
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,959
i think this is you yes yeah yeah and

352
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,359
let me just put this into presentation

353
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,359
mode

354
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,000
okay

355
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,800
okay it was there

356
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,360
do you see it uh you said you clicked on

357
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,839
stop sharing

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,320
oh i what i meant to do was to click on

359
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,880
um

360
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,120
to hide the screen sharing sorry let's

361
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,320
quickly do that again

362
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,519
okay all right meanwhile

363
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,519
i'll just um

364
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
start talking i guess um i'm going to

365
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,800
present

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,160
the use of virtual routing to help call

367
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,880
me use cases

368
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,880
uh specifically um

369
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,399
aji so

370
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,880
this is mostly informational because it

371
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
uh shows how to use existing hard

372
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,240
standards implemented already in

373
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,279
software and hardware

374
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,639
uh in a certain way to help

375
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,439
aji use cases i think it's been a very

376
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,480
edgy

377
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,440
itf all around so

378
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,120
there's a lot of interest hopefully and

379
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,040
maybe this can help

380
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,000
so basically um edge and basically ai

381
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,880
is about taking raw data and turning

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
again

383
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,720
by green sites there's a lot of compute

384
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,639
involved mostly

385
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
multiplying matrices and solving

386
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,160
equations

387
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,759
and it requires a very high level of

388
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,120
concurrency

389
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
uh today mostly we do that in the data

390
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,240
center

391
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,839
using uh leveraging significantly the

392
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,839
spine leaf architecture

393
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:28,079
to scatter gather workloads

394
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:31,360
and maximize concurrency this way

395
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:35,279
and that is fine

396
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,959
using emr data break spark

397
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,399
and we should concentrate uh when

398
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,079
we can but then we have to distribute

399
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,600
when we have to

400
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,439
and that's when we want to push edge to

401
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,839
the

402
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
these edge mostly have to do with

403
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,000
situations

404
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
where the sla is a

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,759
sub second so if you think of the data

406
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,240
center as the brain you can think about

407
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,959
things

408
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,559
uh the edge is more like the spine you

409
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,639
have to react immediately but

410
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,119
intelligently

411
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
um the load is of the raw data is too

412
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,639
heavy

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,079
uh for me to bring in a timely matter to

414
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,120
the data center

415
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,918
that's another situation where i have to

416
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,198
push

417
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
ai to the edge or when there's a

418
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,120
commercial

419
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,080
or regulatory uh

420
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,120
situation where i have to run in a

421
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,439
carrier

422
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,280
in edge premise or in a car oem premise

423
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,960
or in a municipal

424
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
premise or because

425
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:48,000
i want to pull a ai compute

426
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,910
out of the appliances in the field

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,160
as much as i can for the frame exact

428
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,120
[Music]

429
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,240
approach concentrate as much as i can so

430
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,520
i will pull

431
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,520
as much ai as i come from cars

432
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,879
because of updates because of cost

433
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,039
because of idle time

434
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,080
and but i cannot push it all the way up

435
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,320
to the cloud

436
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,320
all right done next slide please

437
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,799
okay so uh we want to push things edge

438
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,919
ai to the edge but we don't have the

439
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,799
data center

440
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,919
mechanisms that we that are are

441
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,480
available to us and

442
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,919
we need to find alternatives and we're

443
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,360
going to examine these alternatives

444
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,080
based on virtual routing

445
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,240
uh by two use cases on production

446
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,559
networks

447
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:41,120
that fit in

448
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:44,480
both i'm sorry

449
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,239
can somebody mute yeah somebody is

450
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,559
typing loudly and there's background

451
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,559
noise

452
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,879
yeah okay so i'm gonna use two

453
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,919
um two production networks that hit

454
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
all of these uh checkpoints uh volume of

455
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,000
raw data response time the cost of

456
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,640
compute

457
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,640
and constraints that they must

458
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,960
be pushed to the edge so one of them is

459
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,000
uh

460
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,840
mobility networks and car

461
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,360
auto big data information gathered by

462
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,840
cars as they drive by

463
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:30,000
vision and sensory and next slide please

464
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,918
and the other example is cyber

465
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,880
where switches

466
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,880
terabit switches are sampled at gigabit

467
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,400
rates and

468
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:46,320
and generate alerts and visibility

469
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,919
for attacks using ai

470
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,559
all right so next slide please i'm gonna

471
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,120
have uh

472
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,320
three slides on virtual routing there's

473
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
not enough time to

474
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,760
deep dive into it so if uh any double

475
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,719
clicking

476
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,480
it can be done in the offline or in the

477
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,960
working group which are relevant so

478
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,320
just uh virtual routing 101 everybody

479
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,200
knows sd1

480
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,240
vxlan the ability to run a logical

481
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
address space

482
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,640
on top of the topological address space

483
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,039
is very useful for hosting enterprises

484
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,480
on

485
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,120
data centers for hybrid clouds and so on

486
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
and the basic idea is if aaa is a

487
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,959
logical address and he wants to talk to

488
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,400
bbb

489
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,039
then that logically addressed packet

490
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,760
is encapsulated inside the topologically

491
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,520
addressed

492
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,480
tunnel between 1.2 and 1.3 and that's

493
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,158
this is how

494
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,320
traffic gets from aaa to bbb

495
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
so the basic uh virtual routing

496
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,639
standards tell us how to encapsulate

497
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
there's a few ways but they don't tell

498
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
us how does

499
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:59,039
um the router 1.2 know that vbb

500
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,760
is behind 1.3 the reason they don't

501
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,840
is you could claim that an overlay

502
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,480
network is just another network

503
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,080
and you could use any routing protocol

504
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,120
of your choice

505
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,360
uh if you like vector path or link state

506
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,439
or whatever

507
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,240
next slide please um

508
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,039
so lisp takes an extra step beyond this

509
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,440
basics

510
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
uh the claim here is that if i'm going

511
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,400
to apply

512
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,799
uh logical routing

513
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,480
in the logical network then i'm going to

514
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
have topological constraints

515
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,240
on my logical addresses i'm going to

516
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,440
have to have route peering which is a

517
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,960
constraint

518
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
i'm going to have to have subnetting

519
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,880
which is a topological constraint

520
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,000
and lisp notion here is that um

521
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,480
i can use an overlay uh

522
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,080
routing for the overlay and underlay

523
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,039
routing for the underlay and overlay

524
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,760
routing idea

525
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,520
is quite simple actually if there is an

526
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,240
overlay there must be an underlay

527
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,360
therefore i can scale a mapping system

528
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,640
between logical address and topological

529
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,320
location

530
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,480
um this is going to be key

531
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,158
for aih because we're going to use

532
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,559
logical addresses as data

533
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,880
indexes we're going to address raw data

534
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,600
using logical addresses to these kill

535
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
zones

536
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,240
where the data is going to be reduced to

537
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,520
insights based on that

538
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,240
sourced routing so a few list concepts

539
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,559
here like

540
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,559
really quick uh eid is the logical

541
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,360
address our lock is the topological

542
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,158
address

543
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,000
xtr is an ingress aggress tunnel router

544
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,919
and rtr is what we use here

545
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
which is a retaining router which is if

546
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,200
aaa is on verizon

547
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,360
and bbb is on a tnt this will still work

548
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
okay next slide please and this is the

549
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,959
last slide

550
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,080
on virtual routing and then jump to

551
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,440
examples uh

552
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,240
if i have a mapping system then i can

553
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
define

554
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,600
a multicast scheme uh which is different

555
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,840
than what we know from pim and mbone

556
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,918
uh which is more like tv kind of uh

557
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,439
multicast where we have thousands of

558
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,880
channels to millions of people

559
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,080
if i use a mapping system then mlds

560
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,520
from aaa subscribing to

561
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,840
s comma g source bbb

562
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,799
theme xyz the mld will stop at the

563
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,240
the tunnel router and he will register

564
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,360
himself

565
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,600
as subscribed to these feeds

566
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,199
so when bbb will send a packet to rtr

567
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,000
uh 1.3 it will look up okay which rtrs

568
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,520
are subscribed on behalf

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,400
of the peers behind them will replicate

570
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,639
to them and these rtrs in turn will

571
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,080
replicate to those

572
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,320
clients so this is uh very useful

573
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,760
for what we're going to do with the edge

574
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,960
reduction because this allows us to have

575
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,400
millions of channels for

576
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,480
thousands of endpoints and this

577
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,679
will be a very effective public

578
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,120
subscribe for

579
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,159
um reductions all right so let's take a

580
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,120
look at how this works uh

581
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,520
next slide please here is example one i

582
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,959
have

583
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,720
sampling of terabit switches uh

584
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,960
in 0.1 percent meaning every

585
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
second i'm gonna scoop thousands out of

586
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,640
millions

587
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,559
of tuples and i'm going to steer them

588
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,279
right at the source or close to the

589
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,600
source

590
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,840
to eids which are five tuple masks

591
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,799
so if every in every sampling cycles and

592
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,000
every switch i'll

593
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,039
pick up some tuples then

594
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,760
uh i will still steer them to one

595
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,799
location which keeps tracks of this five

596
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,039
tuple

597
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,799
a mask or these a bunch of flows or one

598
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,520
flow depending on how i divide this

599
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,080
thing

600
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,960
so that means i can calculate the

601
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,760
distribution

602
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
the bayesian distribution of the flow

603
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,039
and

604
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,679
i can predict what it's going to be i

605
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,000
can create visibility

606
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,240
to the entire traffic even though i'm

607
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
just sampling a fraction of the traffic

608
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,720
and i'm tangent to the network

609
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,799
and without any inline components and

610
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,000
when the flow surprises me then i can

611
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,639
raise the alerts

612
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,559
so this has been very effective uh to

613
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,480
put on top of existing situation or

614
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,279
existing protections and

615
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,320
this mechanism which is uh as i said

616
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,400
tangent

617
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,639
was able to detect ddos like a minute

618
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
before firewall

619
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
sharon you're you're almost out of time

620
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,039
can you uh

621
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,159
advance yes so i'll just skip

622
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:58,000
uh skip this is shows the reduction this

623
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:01,039
shows you the pattern a

624
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,760
row data is sourced

625
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:10,158
to context and then reduced to feeds

626
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,600
and last slide next slide uh

627
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,799
next slide yeah it's okay

628
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,918
and this is the last slide no no no one

629
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,679
more

630
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,679
no back back one

631
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,080
yes okay the second production

632
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,719
example is when cars drive around they

633
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,799
steer

634
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,919
images to a tiles of the earth

635
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,360
which have an ip address an eid

636
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,000
and that eid is calculating the state

637
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,760
it's calculating changes in it

638
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,279
aggregates detections

639
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,039
and it creates a feed over for

640
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,799
other cars of what's going on in this

641
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,158
exactly location so the rest is i think

642
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,039
self-explanatory of what kind of ai

643
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,720
is done how does it reduce the data what

644
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,919
is the data reduction you can take a

645
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,840
look at it yourself

646
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,640
and if there's any questions they'll be

647
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,799
happy to go offline homography

648
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
db scan simplex same i think the

649
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,520
important point here

650
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,159
is that uh this

651
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,240
method of achieving concurrency at the

652
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,960
edge is based on existing standard

653
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,320
existing hardware that performs the load

654
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,600
balancing the security at wire speed

655
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,720
and it's very practical to leverage

656
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,199
going forward in this direction

657
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,200
that's it thank you thank you so much

658
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,520
uh are there any questions i don't see

659
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,720
any hands i don't see any chat

660
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,399
uh however i will have a very quick

661
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,440
question why the next people

662
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:52,239
uh line up their slides if they want to

663
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,240
oh does somebody want more to display

664
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,158
and uh you're next

665
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,000
however sharon i do have a question uh

666
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,080
how do you see the future of this

667
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,080
into coin will you

668
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,479
submit a new uh a new draft it's related

669
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,200
a little bit to the draft that was

670
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,919
started that was looking at

671
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,919
ai and uh computing the network and ai

672
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,679
we can take the discussion to the list

673
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
if you want but it would be nice if you

674
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,960
could

675
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
uh you know think about how you want

676
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,600
this to

677
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
evolve in this group okay that's a great

678
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
question

679
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,559
so uh the the throughout this uh when i

680
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,080
first developed it for

681
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,840
for mobility uh the the my goal was to

682
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,480
invent as little as possible

683
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,240
so that's why i took the lifting overlay

684
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,600
standards and specifically the existing

685
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,880
lisps as standard

686
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,719
so now a what from what we observe after

687
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,000
multiple production networks and use

688
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,320
cases

689
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,360
is that what changes between

690
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,799
use cases is a uh what is the

691
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,439
addressable space meaning

692
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,120
giving a problem how do you divide it

693
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,000
naturally

694
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,639
so that it's algorithmically can be

695
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,760
source

696
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,840
routed to uh achieve distribution and

697
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,600
power processing

698
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,879
and then a a what else changes of course

699
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,719
is the reduction functions which are

700
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,559
domain specific and what else can we

701
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,320
support so the next step will be to

702
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,678
to generalize but keep it informational

703
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:35,279
uh and so would allow you to to

704
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,840
take a a family of uh

705
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,919
problems that can be naturally

706
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,000
pre-partitioned

707
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,000
to an addressable space and that space

708
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,480
after reduction can be subscribed in

709
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,919
scale by applications databases

710
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,000
the next step of processing okay

711
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,279
uh we can also have some of that

712
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,399
discussion online

713
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,480
thank you very much for your

714
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,279
participation and uh

715
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,200
it was great to see you know a different

716
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,000
type of uh

717
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
of computing in the network here uh next

718
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,399
presentation

719
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,479
is dirk in york

720
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,719
do you guys want to present or shall i

721
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,960
present actually it's already there

722
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,960
here's dirk with video wow

723
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,279
yeah so i'm trying to think do you you

724
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,320
have to admit me

725
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:30,080
that i can present i think

726
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,158
do we have to yes yes but i think

727
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,840
you have to request if it doesn't work i

728
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,440
granted it i granted it hopefully it'll

729
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,678
respond

730
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,960
we can see are you seeing my screen

731
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,720
still

732
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,120
yeah you are i think so okay uh but i oh

733
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,320
maybe what it is is that i have to stop

734
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,360
um sharing i think that's what the

735
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,279
issue is i think that's what i heard

736
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,279
okay sorry to delay things here

737
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,080
and now you should be able to yeah

738
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,840
that's what it is so in the future we

739
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,320
have to un

740
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:14,879
display and then others can be granted

741
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,399
how's that perfect looks good okay

742
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,159
okay thanks yeah good morning everybody

743
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:22,239
or um thanks for

744
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,840
staying awake for so long um

745
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,880
okay so this is an update um on the

746
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:33,840
joint work um with the york and

747
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
tamu on coin directions

748
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,320
so

749
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,559
the intention of this draft was to

750
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,279
describe for for the group essentially

751
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,720
or summarize basically um our intentions

752
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,240
so what why are we doing this

753
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,080
what do we mean by in or as uh

754
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,159
marijuana say earlier i mentioned on

755
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,480
network computing um

756
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:04,159
so kind of trying to um characterize the

757
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,600
say most um significant um

758
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,200
ways of conceiving this

759
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,879
um so presenting some some thoughts so

760
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,000
um so at what um say layers or

761
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,200
say also levels of complexity can you

762
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,399
think about

763
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,120
computing in that context and

764
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,120
also trying to

765
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,960
lay out the research landscape so what

766
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,120
are

767
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
actually interesting questions that we

768
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,760
could look um

769
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,039
into in in coin and

770
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,000
so the draft um so far is

771
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,320
um say roughly structured like this so

772
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
we

773
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,720
are introducing different types of

774
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,399
network computing systems

775
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,799
we um kind of collected some

776
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,439
useful terms trying to

777
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,320
differentiate ourselves um and so

778
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,399
characterize

779
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,480
computing a network versus packet

780
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,918
processing network computing so

781
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,880
um um talk about a few

782
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,159
examples from maybe different points in

783
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,080
in this overall

784
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,960
um landscapes and then we um have a

785
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,960
list that's still growing uh of research

786
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,240
challenges

787
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,399
um quickly on the updates

788
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:29,200
um yeah so thanks for adopting this um

789
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,000
as a research group item um thanks very

790
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,559
much

791
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,679
sergey for the feedback on the list so

792
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,760
we are currently working on this for the

793
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,600
next revision

794
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,960
in the meantime we also had additional

795
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,320
discussions with uh

796
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,120
of course within our co-author community

797
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,279
but also with

798
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,039
other collaborators in our research

799
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,840
projects

800
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,519
um and so so interestingly we are

801
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,678
currently working with applications

802
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,200
and developers that have some

803
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,559
interesting use cases that are

804
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:06,799
beyond the traditional data center

805
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,159
and same multi-access edge computing uh

806
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,199
scenarios

807
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,560
so we hope to also get some more in yeah

808
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,839
kind of insights and

809
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,839
perhaps also feedback from that

810
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,040
okay maybe um so the the feedback

811
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:26,000
um if we were to summarize that um

812
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,320
um again thanks very much sergey um for

813
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
for

814
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,639
providing that um so we have a

815
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
you know to do item list here um there's

816
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,000
some um

817
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,839
of course editorial things to take care

818
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,359
of um

819
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,639
it was an interesting point raised um so

820
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,679
yeah to what extent um yeah should we

821
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,960
consider

822
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,839
you know packet processing as really a

823
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,960
computing in the network um thing i mean

824
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,239
we have some work

825
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:00,400
um like we also talked about earlier

826
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,799
on the topic um so yeah we are

827
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,520
could be i mean interesting to discuss

828
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,960
um

829
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,560
so how much we want to do on that in the

830
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,599
future i'm not excluding it but

831
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,279
um so in general

832
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,720
i mean um the idea of adopting a a draft

833
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,160
is of course also that

834
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,959
the group takes over the

835
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,319
change control of the draft so it's also

836
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,960
now up to you to really check it more

837
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,960
carefully and

838
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:35,200
tell us what needs to be added um

839
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:38,160
so then there are questions of um

840
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
discovery um in the research challenges

841
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,720
so

842
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,879
whether that that should be um like a

843
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,000
prominent topic there

844
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,000
um we haven't made up our minds yet um

845
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,480
but um of course uh it's a good question

846
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,440
um savia also raised an interesting

847
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,119
question

848
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,400
um as to who's actually um the user in

849
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,119
in like

850
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,240
coin scenarios i mean is it like the

851
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,400
traditional

852
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,759
maybe you know human mobile user or

853
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,720
something

854
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,280
um or is there also some so a different

855
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,319
uh

856
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,119
notion so who is uh in that sense

857
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,880
invoking a distributed computing for

858
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,079
example

859
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,000
um so that could be that they yeah they

860
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,000
did like user initiated

861
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,680
foreground things we would also have

862
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
some um

863
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,359
so kind of background um

864
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,280
processing or something so we

865
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,960
actually yeah we are currently

866
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,040
discussing with like taco operators for

867
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,160
example whether there is a

868
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,160
point in using like a coin approach to

869
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,759
network management for example and that

870
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,799
could maybe

871
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:52,240
a bit going into this selection

872
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,800
um also related the lifetime of and life

873
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,200
cycle

874
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,079
of in-network compute functions so is

875
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,118
that something like more like a service

876
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,560
or something like a one-shot status

877
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,480
invocation of course there

878
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,960
is probably both um but so

879
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:14,640
maybe better describe these different um

880
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,800
types of computing perhaps um

881
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,078
other things that we came up with um

882
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,520
result provenance

883
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,480
um so there are these um use cases where

884
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,079
um

885
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,839
you know computing is about data

886
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,359
processing and

887
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,759
so that's um interesting

888
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,960
yeah important question um so how can

889
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,359
you trust the data

890
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,240
and how can you trust the computation

891
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,759
steps

892
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,598
on the data or can you say anything

893
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,240
about that

894
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,079
um bit related perhaps to the previous

895
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,439
presentation

896
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,160
impact of mobility so sometimes you want

897
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,359
to

898
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,839
you know maintain a set of

899
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,480
um distributed computing nodes for

900
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,400
example

901
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,000
um how is that possible or what are the

902
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,640
challenges when things are

903
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,640
more dynamic

904
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,599
um so in general this is a bit um

905
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,118
so the additional thoughts we we put up

906
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,720
together

907
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,040
um so we have we we had this discussion

908
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,000
about um computing in the network

909
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,440
whether it's in network

910
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,480
computing or on network computing um

911
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,440
so i think uh what

912
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,400
we probably don't want to do is um you

913
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,520
know

914
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:35,200
integrating computing in the say a big

915
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,440
big internet capital internet

916
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,480
in the sense that while we are changing

917
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
the internet

918
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,680
architecture or something that you know

919
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,960
every router has

920
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,160
has to be programmable or has to support

921
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,800
computing um and also

922
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,000
i don't think it's you know leading to

923
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,000
anywhere

924
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,520
when we have to like you know develop

925
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
alternative cloud architectures all

926
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,759
these kind of things

927
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,240
but we think what's interesting here is

928
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,359
um

929
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,919
you know also maybe approaching this

930
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,240
from from

931
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,040
two perspectives so applying internet

932
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,598
principles

933
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,880
uh to uh distributed computing um for

934
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,079
example

935
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,040
thinking about um you know the function

936
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,240
or work split between things like um

937
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,040
yeah routing

938
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,759
forwarding intelligence um mapping

939
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,920
systems

940
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,720
like the ones we heard about before um

941
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,280
but then also in the other direction um

942
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,919
learning

943
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,720
um from how distable computing systems

944
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,839
work today

945
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,959
and uh maybe how this could be

946
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,640
on the one hand um supported better

947
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,640
by um say maybe say a network approach

948
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,720
but also what can we learn in terms of

949
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,160
um you know mechanisms

950
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,919
consensus mechanisms these kind of

951
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,200
things um for for building systems

952
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,040
and um so while we're not kind of

953
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,520
probably changing the whole internet we

954
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,640
may end up with a set of technologies in

955
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,720
the end that help us

956
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,839
to do distributed computing better

957
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,240
for specific environments and yeah i

958
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,960
mean

959
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,279
they could then leverage yeah coin

960
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,359
derived principles perhaps

961
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,640
um we don't think this this should be

962
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,359
necessarily constrained by

963
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,078
you know our understanding of how you

964
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,240
know

965
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,680
communication tcip based communication

966
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,240
works today

967
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,240
but of course there's also um

968
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,759
probably one end of the spectrum and

969
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,759
yeah we have seen that there are many

970
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,440
domain specific solutions

971
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,800
industrial iot use cases and so on

972
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
on the one side would be good if they

973
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,440
are not only you know

974
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,480
you know point solutions um on the other

975
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,680
hand of course there is

976
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,880
also good reason to you know have maybe

977
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,118
kind of specialized

978
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,119
um

979
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,040
yeah implementations of of a coin

980
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,480
systems in

981
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,920
these environments so

982
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,400
we haven't really put this into the

983
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,240
draft yet but

984
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,599
so we think that concluding the network

985
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,479
is a bit more than just forwarding

986
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,040
packets to

987
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,000
nodes that happen to host um you know

988
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,560
services

989
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:21,040
on vms or represented as processes

990
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,400
this because this can be done um already

991
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,759
with various tools

992
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,480
so i think there's potential to go a bit

993
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,119
beyond that

994
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,240
um and so yeah we embrace the idea of

995
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,400
supporting

996
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,759
disability computing better as we as we

997
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,920
discussed before

998
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,000
so not just building pipes between

999
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,440
processes

1000
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,880
and um yeah i think we mentioned that

1001
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,880
last time so

1002
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,440
it's probably not so we don't see much

1003
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,920
research potential in you know

1004
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,040
um you know enhancing tcp adding new

1005
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,079
headers or something

1006
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,040
um to support in-network computing um in

1007
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,680
in that direction

1008
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,160
so because first of all probably doesn't

1009
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,200
really

1010
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,149
um fits so well to the end-to-end

1011
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,640
stream model when you have to

1012
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:10,720
[Music]

1013
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:14,078
implement hot by hop processing or

1014
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,439
you know data manipulation

1015
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,599
so if i think if we run into this

1016
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,520
problem we probably should rethink our

1017
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,480
requirements fundamentally and

1018
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,400
um so i think it's really important also

1019
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,599
to keep the security model in mind so of

1020
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,599
course we can

1021
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,800
you know manage to steer packets to any

1022
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,440
point in the network

1023
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,240
uh where some compute happens but we

1024
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,160
don't think that's

1025
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,399
uh necessarily um helping so much so

1026
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,520
it's also really important to have a

1027
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,720
good security

1028
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,640
um story um so as we mentioned before

1029
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,399
um can you trust the nodes can you trust

1030
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,960
the computation the results and so on

1031
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
um so that's a bit uh i mean it's not

1032
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
only like

1033
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,520
to be just picked this tcp example is um

1034
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,839
say one way to to illustrate uh what's

1035
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,200
probably not so not so um interesting to

1036
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,560
us

1037
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,439
at least our view so far

1038
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,319
okay so here's the plan so we will

1039
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,480
resubmit

1040
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,480
the draft now with the new name um

1041
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,720
currently trying to think about say yeah

1042
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,160
more representative use cases so i mean

1043
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,078
we don't want to you know just fill

1044
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,520
pages with describing all kinds of

1045
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,359
possible use cases but

1046
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,960
should be you know they should bring

1047
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,240
some some merit and

1048
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,280
interesting aspects um yeah

1049
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,839
try to to include more

1050
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,079
there are different technology variants

1051
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,720
um

1052
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:49,520
we started some discussion or work on

1053
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,520
taxonomy type of text

1054
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,000
and i think we could also now update the

1055
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,520
draft a little bit with um

1056
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,480
you know capturing so like recent um

1057
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,040
activities in in in coin and um so

1058
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,800
that's

1059
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,759
also on the list um so but the overall

1060
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,839
goal remains so i mean this is not about

1061
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,400
laying out a coin architecture or

1062
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,759
something or

1063
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,880
of course also not any kind of solution

1064
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,480
but really more as a document that helps

1065
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,400
us to understand the problem

1066
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
um and so hopefully it's going to be

1067
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,760
useful for that

1068
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,240
um so yeah of course it may not cover

1069
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,720
all the

1070
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,520
all the um possible variants of network

1071
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,520
computing but

1072
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,839
um so let's let's find a like a 80

1073
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,839
percent

1074
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:51,520
coverage here okay that's that's it for

1075
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:55,839
for this time so i'm done

1076
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,960
thank you um i don't see anybody in the

1077
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:04,160
uh there's

1078
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,160
a lot of chat but okay

1079
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,440
question was your reference to the use

1080
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,000
cases draft

1081
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,880
um i kind of like the idea actually of

1082
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,599
using that

1083
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,000
as a holding place for use cases that

1084
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,440
are

1085
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,079
interesting because then every draft

1086
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,440
every other draft doesn't have to

1087
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,280
re-enumerate

1088
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,880
all the use cases was that what you were

1089
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,960
saying sir

1090
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,760
or were you saying you were on the line

1091
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,200
with it you clarified

1092
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,839
yeah i mean use cases um in terms of

1093
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,359
you know yeah classes of use cases so

1094
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,040
representative use cases that

1095
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:44,480
um yeah reflect some

1096
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:49,119
different categories of

1097
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,760
coin concepts or realizing coin concepts

1098
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,160
um of course i don't think we should you

1099
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,960
know we should use an internet draft to

1100
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,720
collect all kinds of possible use cases

1101
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,160
i mean that could also be done on a

1102
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,839
wiki page or something but yeah some

1103
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,759
some

1104
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,920
some level of extraction would be good i

1105
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,920
think

1106
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,319
any other question if not thank you very

1107
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,200
much

1108
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,480
and i think we will go to the next

1109
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,598
presentation

1110
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,720
hang on it looks like that icky and phil

1111
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,040
both have questions yeah hi here's ike

1112
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,759
so one of the authors of the use cases

1113
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,119
draft

1114
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,599
um i just wanted to chime in here um

1115
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,480
so our idea was actually just as eve

1116
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,359
said to

1117
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,920
have a like collection of the drafts of

1118
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,640
the different

1119
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,280
uh available use cases that we have and

1120
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,000
then

1121
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,640
similar to what dirk said we then want

1122
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,960
to

1123
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,640
yeah create also some form of taxonomy

1124
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,720
out of that so that we just

1125
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,480
don't only have that collection of use

1126
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,279
cases but also some

1127
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,839
um yeah for the good coming from the

1128
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,880
draft

1129
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,839
um yeah because just as dirk said um we

1130
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
could also collect

1131
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,759
use cases somewhere else but we also

1132
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,240
want to provide them some form of

1133
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,640
taxonomy from that but i will talk about

1134
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,359
that later as well

1135
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,680
okay yeah so um yeah i mean we're happy

1136
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,279
to

1137
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,240
um you know find a useful

1138
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,079
um split between you know topics use

1139
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,879
cases for

1140
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,440
with the other draft um so yeah i think

1141
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,280
that let's

1142
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,880
just discuss this offline what is it

1143
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,760
it's a good way to speak to

1144
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,760
um organize this

1145
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,160
i think what would be how it's phil here

1146
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,400
i think what would be nice

1147
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,279
um not just to make a taxonomy of them

1148
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,800
but to

1149
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,040
try and draw out the kind of key

1150
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,119
requirements for coin

1151
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,359
so you know collect them together in a

1152
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,319
way that it's the requirements that come

1153
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,799
out rather than just

1154
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:56,640
a taxonomy use cases yeah so

1155
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,960
um i think we are a bit reluctant on

1156
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,759
really calling this requirements because

1157
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,119
i mean this is

1158
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,920
research um i mean we

1159
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,640
so it's a bit more collecting ideas and

1160
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
um

1161
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,920
yeah you know putting them together in

1162
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,439
an understandable way

1163
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,880
we can't really uh mandate some so many

1164
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,079
things here

1165
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,920
yeah perhaps it's the wrong way of

1166
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,760
putting it but what are the sort of

1167
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,040
weird or surprising things that come out

1168
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,960
of these use cases that

1169
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,319
mean that you the comment the common

1170
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,760
elements maybe

1171
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,920
yeah yeah okay good

1172
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,359
i don't know okay so we're out of time

1173
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,480
right now uh okay so i think um

1174
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,640
eve you're the one who's going to

1175
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,400
present the next one right

1176
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:46,240
i am okay there you go okay so i think

1177
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,240
okay let's see go back to this

1178
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:54,558
um uh we're running a bit behind so

1179
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:55,440
um why don't i make it really quick let

1180
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,119
me just make it well

1181
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,119
of my time okay

1182
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,160
what did you want to see say you should

1183
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:08,160
say that thing that's fine

1184
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:11,200
okay let me put this in full screen moon

1185
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,558
okay um one change that happened was

1186
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,359
that xavier joined the

1187
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,079
the drafts um we had kind of two

1188
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,680
phenomena

1189
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,280
happen we started out life um as having

1190
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,520
a draft that was specifically around

1191
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,800
data discovery for edge

1192
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,800
um based on some use cases that in fact

1193
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,640
we presented pretty early on

1194
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:36,000
in the um beginning of the coin

1195
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,799
uh endeavor and at the bath and um

1196
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,119
it ended up that we there were quite a

1197
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,720
few

1198
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,800
other discovery drafts that it generated

1199
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,759
kind of an overarching discovery problem

1200
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,720
statement and

1201
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,760
also then a mobility discovery uh if we

1202
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,078
don't see your

1203
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,079
your screen at all oh

1204
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,839
okay uh

1205
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,480
start again

1206
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,800
okay

1207
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,279
okay and so the point was that we kind

1208
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,920
of expanded into

1209
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,640
three drafts around discovery and now we

1210
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,359
are beginning

1211
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,799
to kind of re-coalesce and in this

1212
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,520
latest iteration

1213
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,800
uh xavier's draft on mobility uh the

1214
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,880
language was included

1215
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,359
um some of the language was included in

1216
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,079
the edge data discovery draft and it is

1217
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,440
our

1218
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,359
intention to revisit whether we need um

1219
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,599
you know multiple drafts on discovery or

1220
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,480
just one but i wanted those of you who

1221
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,160
hadn't

1222
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,880
been following to understand at least

1223
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,879
the lineage

1224
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:59,279
let's see if i can get this to move

1225
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,279
uh for some reason

1226
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,960
i'm not getting controls

1227
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,000
are you seeing anything i'm not it seems

1228
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:13,119
like my computer doesn't move

1229
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,800
it's not moving okay let's just do it

1230
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,200
this way then

1231
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,920
okay um so what is the problem here

1232
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,799
uh the problem as alluded to by all of

1233
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:27,839
the talks

1234
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:30,720
today is that increasingly the compute

1235
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,359
capabilities are really scattered around

1236
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,240
the network

1237
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,000
everywhere and that really has blurred

1238
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,720
the line between what's the network

1239
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,200
and what's compute and what's storage

1240
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,279
and

1241
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,799
just as the compute is getting scattered

1242
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,359
increasingly

1243
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,280
a consequence of that is that the data

1244
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,880
is getting created everywhere

1245
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,280
it's getting cached and copied

1246
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,760
everywhere and each time it's computed

1247
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,319
across

1248
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,280
it's transformed and becomes yet new

1249
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,839
data so data begets new data

1250
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,960
and so we have this problem that data is

1251
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:04,049
scattered

1252
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,280
and especially um

1253
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,800
[Music]

1254
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,720
you know again this the problem sort of

1255
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,480
originated uh with

1256
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,839
with these sort of edge use cases that

1257
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,599
we were examining

1258
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,759
um but what it leaves us with the

1259
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,520
predicament is that we really would like

1260
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,559
to understand then

1261
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,640
how do we find this data or pockets of

1262
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,359
data data lakes or databases

1263
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,799
and within those pockets of data

1264
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,279
specific data

1265
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,200
objects where are they located and we'd

1266
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,680
like to do that

1267
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,558
to locate this distributed data in some

1268
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,520
kind of open

1269
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,640
and standardized way instead of in sort

1270
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,559
of proprietary

1271
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,078
silo fashion because there are many

1272
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,079
solutions to this but

1273
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,000
you know how do we kind of liberate the

1274
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:49,760
data from all of these

1275
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
disparate places and

1276
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
when we say data we mean data that's

1277
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,880
measurement data that's sort of the

1278
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,640
typical iot

1279
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:01,440
definition of data but also

1280
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,720
when we talk in terms of you know what

1281
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,280
it is that we're sending across the

1282
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,759
network

1283
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,680
really the network is agnostic and

1284
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,599
protocols would be agnostic

1285
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:12,319
to what it is they're sending it's

1286
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,079
really just a bag of bits and in fact

1287
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,200
um sometimes we're sending around the

1288
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,359
compute itself programs and services

1289
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,240
that are the executables or functions or

1290
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,319
algorithms

1291
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,558
um because we need to move them around

1292
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,558
because in fact the data measurements

1293
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,040
they're so enormous if it's video or

1294
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,119
something else

1295
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,640
sometimes we can't move the measurement

1296
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,240
data or the monitoring data we have to

1297
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,359
move the compute to it so in that case

1298
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,319
it's the bag of bits

1299
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,640
and then of course there's all the

1300
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,119
metadata that describes either the data

1301
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,200
or the

1302
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,720
or the applications and and other things

1303
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,078
and those might describe for example

1304
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,118
resources

1305
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:49,440
um uh eve can you make the font slightly

1306
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,440
bigger

1307
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,720
how's that yes it's better okay

1308
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,920
um and so uh last time there was quite a

1309
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,919
bit of discussion

1310
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:04,800
about um we were kind of on the brink of

1311
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,520
asking the the group whether or not the

1312
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,319
edge

1313
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,200
data discovery draft was ready to be

1314
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,880
adopted

1315
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,680
um as a draft to and in fact drill down

1316
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,839
as uh dirk alluded to this issue about

1317
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,960
discovery to what extent is that an

1318
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:23,119
attendant problem around coin um but we

1319
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,280
were really challenged in the debate

1320
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,960
uh and question and answer at the last

1321
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,160
ietf and so we thought we'd take a

1322
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,640
moment to say

1323
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,520
you know why do we think that discovery

1324
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,480
particularly

1325
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,440
around data is fundamental to coin and

1326
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,839
it's because

1327
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,960
at least my mental model of what coin is

1328
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:41,119
or what computation

1329
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,200
is is that it's a function it gets

1330
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:48,400
performed on data and it typically

1331
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:51,040
generates data and so all three of those

1332
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
aspects each like the input data we need

1333
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,880
to marshal it from somewhere

1334
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,440
we may not be you know things are not

1335
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,000
always tidy containerized

1336
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,920
workloads we may need to marshal the

1337
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,319
data from somewhere

1338
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,599
on the fly particularly in autonomous

1339
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,279
kinds of situations

1340
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,880
furthermore it's not just the data we

1341
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,079
may be marshaling but we may be needing

1342
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,760
to marshal

1343
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,920
the function itself the compute the

1344
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,160
algorithm and so forth because again

1345
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,040
sometimes it's contextual what it is

1346
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,078
that we want

1347
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,640
the function to be um and then uh

1348
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,760
sort of in this last stage uh of course

1349
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,720
there's output

1350
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,520
from the computation and we need enough

1351
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,200
context

1352
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,319
and metadata about our place in the

1353
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,919
universe

1354
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:36,079
whether we're mobile or you know

1355
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,400
changing dynamic network um

1356
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,680
situations to understand where do we

1357
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,079
place that data

1358
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,680
for potential reuse whether it's cached

1359
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,599
or replicated

1360
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:50,319
um uh or archived for that matter

1361
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,319
and so that's really um you know the

1362
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,680
crux for why we we think data discover

1363
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,960
is fundamental

1364
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,520
so we we outlined why do we think that

1365
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,559
coin might be the right place for this

1366
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,280
kind of discussion

1367
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:04,160
well um research groups are good staging

1368
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,280
grounds for

1369
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,680
um uh

1370
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,640
it says mature ideas but it says i

1371
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,000
wanted to say mature

1372
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,160
ideas that are not mature um and and so

1373
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,559
in fact data discovery is an early stage

1374
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,640
idea and as such it has no specific

1375
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,680
protocols or architectures that we're

1376
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:25,680
recommending at this point um but as i

1377
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,520
stated data discovery is motivated by

1378
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,480
compute but it's also motivated by

1379
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,599
mobility

1380
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,799
and network dynamics uh linking back to

1381
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,559
the previous talks

1382
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,640
and then you know why wouldn't we put it

1383
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,440
in coin well it seems a bit off topic

1384
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,598
based on our

1385
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,559
original group charter it would seem

1386
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,880
less off topic

1387
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:44,400
uh in terms of the if you know if you

1388
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,640
were following the progress of these

1389
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,599
discussions uh since the beginning of

1390
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,400
coin

1391
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,319
um and you know we did have this problem

1392
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,319
that the documents have

1393
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,319
we've had multiple documents that seem

1394
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,279
to have sort of blurred

1395
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,400
uh the relevance or you know grown the

1396
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,160
scope and that maybe

1397
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,400
one of the outcomes of these debates is

1398
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,279
that uh maybe we need to better

1399
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,720
characterize

1400
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:11,200
what needs discovery in coin um

1401
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,118
and really focus in on that so that was

1402
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,879
really um

1403
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,079
the recap and uh so really the question

1404
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,440
to the group is

1405
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,079
uh do people think that it is relevant

1406
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,119
and if so is the document at least

1407
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,799
mature enough

1408
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,559
uh having been now to about five

1409
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:32,240
iterations um

1410
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:34,000
to regret uh request adoption so i guess

1411
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,200
you mean the first one right because

1412
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,520
there's three of those

1413
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,480
oh no uh the one that's the most mature

1414
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,839
is the edge data discovery okay so the

1415
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,559
first one

1416
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,040
uh and for for the sake of time i i

1417
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,839
think

1418
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,359
we could put that question to the group

1419
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,920
uh i think you were

1420
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,520
right in uh saying yet people were

1421
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,480
thinking it was a bit off topic but

1422
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,200
again

1423
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,200
uh when i started listening to like i

1424
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,960
said other meetings and when i started

1425
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,839
thinking about it and i did meet with

1426
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,440
seve

1427
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,759
here in montreal i think we had a good

1428
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,720
discussion about what it could mean

1429
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,559
so we could push that to the list uh but

1430
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,118
i would ask you the question you always

1431
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,880
ask

1432
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,559
but everybody presents them to this

1433
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,720
group eve

1434
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,520
is it only you guys or there's actually

1435
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,439
other research on that

1436
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,280
well i don't know i mean like i could

1437
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,960
bounce this question back to dirk i mean

1438
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,240
it was on his list and we did not

1439
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,359
coordinate

1440
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,319
um you know i i didn't prime him to say

1441
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:33,279
that he thinks that

1442
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:33,920
you know discovery is a is a research

1443
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,119
topic

1444
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,400
um or a research direction for coins so

1445
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,520
um perhaps you know hearing from people

1446
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,440
from these other quarters would be a

1447
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,200
helpful different perspective i mean my

1448
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,640
my position is like you can't do compute

1449
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,480
without data and well we need to find it

1450
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,200
and whether we we think that these

1451
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,400
different flavors of computation

1452
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,759
that we refer to in in the title coin

1453
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:06,400
um represent the kinds of computations

1454
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,680
that uh are less tidy than containerized

1455
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,760
workloads which was i think what the

1456
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:11,200
debate about was about last time

1457
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,119
and that they're going to be these more

1458
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,839
autonomous situations

1459
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,640
um with more dynamic uh context like

1460
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,920
mobility

1461
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:23,040
um and and network uh changes and

1462
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,319
programmable networks uh where

1463
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:29,200
we're going to need to find the data

1464
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:30,319
uh more on the flag and will need to be

1465
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,399
assisted through

1466
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:35,520
discovery maliciously we have lost in

1467
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,520
the queue maybe

1468
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,960
wonderful come debate with us hey guys

1469
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,240
yeah so this is actually a more general

1470
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,480
point not so much

1471
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,919
related to this particular document

1472
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,240
although we can have a discussion here

1473
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,480
too

1474
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:50,000
so i want to say that i'm i think

1475
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,440
actually we're wasting a lot of time

1476
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,280
discussing whether something should be

1477
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,720
adopted by a working group

1478
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,040
um and it's actually not a working group

1479
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,118
it's a research group right or not

1480
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,880
i think that is that is just a waste of

1481
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,319
time right i don't really care whether

1482
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,280
something is a research group document

1483
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,720
or not it doesn't matter

1484
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,040
but i think a much more worthwhile

1485
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,640
question is to ask is would this group

1486
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,200
want to discuss more of this in the

1487
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,680
future

1488
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,960
like this particularly right and then

1489
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:14,078
whether something is a research group

1490
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,920
document or not

1491
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,839
who actually cares right it doesn't

1492
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,160
matter that the point is that you want

1493
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:22,240
to have a discussion on on something and

1494
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:24,160
um therefore also i wouldn't be so

1495
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,160
limited to the charter right whether

1496
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,240
you know if people if there's no

1497
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,920
community here to discuss this further

1498
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,839
um it doesn't matter even if it was in

1499
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,280
the charter right and on the flip side

1500
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,480
if it's not directly in the charter but

1501
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,400
people want to discuss it

1502
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,920
what's the harm in it to do that for a

1503
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,079
while so i would

1504
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,960
um not act so much as a working group

1505
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,640
you guys i think it's

1506
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,400
it's actually harmful what to what

1507
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,720
you're trying to do

1508
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,720
thanks okay thank you for that advice

1509
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,279
so i would say we've had comments on the

1510
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,319
opposite too so i think we're going to

1511
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,640
uh bring that in the middle or they

1512
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,240
could

1513
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,839
take but i agree uh lars that uh

1514
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,680
and this is actually something that we

1515
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,640
discussed about this meeting that we

1516
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:14,960
were completely dominated by drafts

1517
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:17,200
but um and i see mike saying is it

1518
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,559
i'm full to ask for adoption though but

1519
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,640
yeah maybe

1520
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,319
maybe it's not that necessary but i

1521
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,160
would say that we were we were

1522
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,640
lars we were very much discussing the

1523
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,040
fact that we were dominated by drafts

1524
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,558
and that we wanted to have more time for

1525
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,839
uh

1526
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,760
um like more research presentations and

1527
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,279
this is what we want to do for for the

1528
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,799
the interim because

1529
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,280
again this but that's that's the way

1530
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:45,359
it it happened yeah and also i think you

1531
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,079
want to have much more q a than than

1532
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,839
you're having

1533
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,359
which is not a whole lot and mike it's

1534
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,640
not harmful to ask for research group

1535
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:52,480
adoption but i think it just

1536
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:54,319
wastes time and it doesn't matter what's

1537
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,079
the why does it matter whether this is a

1538
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,520
research group document or not

1539
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:01,520
it you know i really

1540
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,319
at this point at least i don't i don't

1541
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,680
really see the value in debating this

1542
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,680
in the meeting where we could actually

1543
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,919
talk about the technical content

1544
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,680
rather than whether we're handling it

1545
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,799
this way or the other way

1546
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:19,359
yeah point taken thank you

1547
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:19,359
thank you dirk did you have a comment

1548
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,160
good morning um i mean i haven't had

1549
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:27,520
an awful lot of time to look at the

1550
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,680
trout yet but i do

1551
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:31,599
think the topic is extremely important

1552
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,200
but i wonder in terms of

1553
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:37,280
um rg relevance it's not about rg

1554
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,520
adoption it's about rg relevance

1555
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,039
to try to ask the questions on data

1556
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,038
discovery more i mean

1557
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,160
coin has two aspects in the title one is

1558
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,400
computation

1559
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,440
and data is probably different i truly

1560
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,160
agree

1561
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,520
but um i think what would be interesting

1562
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,118
to ask questions as

1563
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,920
to what extent is an in-networking

1564
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,440
question or relevance what is it network

1565
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,039
really can do to aid

1566
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,119
the problem the problem of distributed

1567
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,480
data is a huge problem and it's it's

1568
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,039
it's extremely relevant

1569
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,160
um in some of those questions i had

1570
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,319
recently for instance with

1571
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,680
you know transportation automotive where

1572
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:13,839
the trend

1573
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,598
stays at data centralization and compute

1574
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:17,599
centralization purely because

1575
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,599
you know oems and car manufacturers are

1576
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:21,039
very concerned about data

1577
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,640
floating about and not being under their

1578
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,920
control so it's a huge problem

1579
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,400
it's very relevant but i think the

1580
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,039
question for coin would be

1581
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:31,440
to not forget the networking part how is

1582
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,839
it that in-network capability can

1583
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,839
aid the problem and not discuss problems

1584
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,640
about data discovery in general because

1585
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,200
you know that's a computational uh issue

1586
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,319
which

1587
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,640
mutually interesting but i'm not

1588
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,680
entirely sure how much coin can shed

1589
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,160
light on because there's a huge

1590
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,839
community

1591
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,839
out there so it would be good to hone

1592
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:52,720
into the the the

1593
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,720
in the networking part quite a bit

1594
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,119
and i can harm raise my hand on that

1595
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,760
because i have a little bit of interest

1596
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,440
in that i have to see how my time allows

1597
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,880
to more specifically contribute to the

1598
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:04,799
draft but uh

1599
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,079
at least i have an interest in it so see

1600
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,960
it as a half hand

1601
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,760
for conjugation well but you're next

1602
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,039
dirk so

1603
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:16,079
um or where you and ike

1604
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:26,160
so that's

1605
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:28,240
yeah i'll do it's you guys

1606
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,558
so great can you grant me the uh

1607
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,759
presentation right

1608
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:33,760
yes here we go

1609
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,720
see right so um now that we've had a

1610
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,759
discussion already on the use cases

1611
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,399
like before here uh

1612
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,599
let's get it going again um so as

1613
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,160
jeffrey has already said in the

1614
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,599
beginning

1615
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:56,160
um we're now moving away from the only

1616
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:57,760
sole focus on industry but we know all

1617
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,480
the other use cases

1618
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,680
um and um yeah in this quick

1619
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,640
presentation i wanted

1620
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:07,200
to yeah give you our intentions um what

1621
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,440
we want to achieve with this draft and

1622
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:11,200
yeah as is all as you have also heard

1623
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,319
now durk has joined us

1624
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:17,839
um in the group of authors

1625
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:20,079
so yeah um

1626
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:21,038
the premise of the draft was or

1627
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,200
previously was

1628
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,240
that we wanted to um highlight the

1629
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,960
importance for

1630
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,959
of coin for industrial use cases um so

1631
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,160
we collected quite a bunch of them

1632
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:34,079
in that draft um but then dirk suggested

1633
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,200
that it might be a good idea to have a

1634
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:37,039
draft that is

1635
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,240
rather open for other use cases as well

1636
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,799
because then we can

1637
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,558
actually cover a larger spectrum of

1638
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,559
requirements as well

1639
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:45,599
and this is why we have now opened up

1640
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,799
our draft

1641
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:52,000
so that we now want to really um yeah

1642
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,280
also take a look at other use cases um

1643
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,480
this also reflects

1644
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,480
in the the new structure that we have on

1645
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,520
the draft so as you can see we have

1646
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,280
um moved down

1647
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:08,160
the industrial use cases part from

1648
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,200
the from the title down into a section

1649
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,160
level

1650
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,038
um as you can see on the on the bottom

1651
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,680
we have

1652
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,799
quite a bunch of other use cases that we

1653
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,038
are planning to

1654
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:20,640
insert into the draft or currently they

1655
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,200
are only placeholders

1656
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:28,240
um so we didn't really find the time to

1657
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:30,558
insert them already so that's one of our

1658
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,038
next steps that we want to do

1659
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,880
we then want to have a similar structure

1660
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:38,799
for all of those use cases

1661
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:41,039
um so as you can see up there in uh 3.21

1662
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:43,440
and 3.22 for example

1663
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,559
um there's also some part of that in

1664
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,039
what phil

1665
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,720
suggested a couple of minutes ago and

1666
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:52,000
then finally we want to

1667
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,799
work on those findings that we have

1668
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,880
there and then

1669
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,559
create some kind of taxonomy find common

1670
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,559
building blocks and so on

1671
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,720
um and yeah and the following i want to

1672
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,720
go a little bit into more detail

1673
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,879
on the different aspects that i've shown

1674
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,279
here on the slide

1675
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,880
so first up the new use cases that we

1676
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,799
have already

1677
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,640
so as you can see most of them will be

1678
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:16,960
coming over from the absence draft of

1679
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:21,038
dirk um

1680
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,359
so we we um similar to what i

1681
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,359
said uh in the presentation of the other

1682
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:28,400
dirk a couple of minutes ago

1683
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:28,960
um we think that it might be a good idea

1684
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,319
if we have

1685
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,880
like this these use cases um collected

1686
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,520
in a central position where we can then

1687
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,880
um

1688
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,359
really point to from other other drafts

1689
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:41,280
then

1690
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,200
um so that the other drafts out can then

1691
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:47,200
really focus on on

1692
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:51,598
context on their real content

1693
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:54,240
and like then everyone else

1694
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,000
yet does only have to know the central

1695
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:58,479
use cases draft of the use case that

1696
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,760
are in there and then understanding

1697
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,000
other use cases or

1698
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,359
the the other drafts is then perhaps a

1699
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
bit easier

1700
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:07,200
um but then as you can see here the in

1701
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,160
the 5.2

1702
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,879
are also thinking about some form of h a

1703
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,319
r and v

1704
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,799
r um so the dirk has a use case or

1705
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:19,359
or some ideas on that um we also thought

1706
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:21,278
that it might be a good idea to

1707
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:24,159
potentially move some of the content of

1708
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,000
the uh now expired draft of marijuana

1709
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:28,080
over to this draft here

1710
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,759
um and there are also a couple of other

1711
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:30,238
sources that we could think of at this

1712
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,040
point

1713
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,318
um so to fill this initial set of new

1714
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,158
use cases

1715
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:41,839
um but in general we also open

1716
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:45,439
for for other um use cases

1717
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:46,880
um and what we are generally intend to

1718
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,919
have as a structure here

1719
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,319
is like some form of three-fold approach

1720
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:53,279
we first want to have a short motivation

1721
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,920
that

1722
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,440
generally describes the setting that we

1723
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:00,080
that we're looking at

1724
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,960
um so using the example here of this

1725
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,519
network control

1726
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:05,279
we just described here that cyber

1727
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,480
physical systems are increasingly

1728
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,040
complex

1729
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:10,318
and that local control in that scenario

1730
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:12,399
is not often

1731
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,920
are often not really sufficient anymore

1732
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,399
and that the central control

1733
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,520
um might help in that in those cases so

1734
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,799
just setting the

1735
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:24,000
the major the general stage for

1736
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:26,000
for the um for the use case then

1737
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,679
um after that we then plan on having

1738
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,399
characterization and requirements

1739
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,399
so uh phil mentioned that we also should

1740
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:35,679
collect requirements and that is

1741
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:37,358
actually what we want to at least enable

1742
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:40,719
with our approach here

1743
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:43,920
um and um using the

1744
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,960
example of the network control again we

1745
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,960
would

1746
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,719
characterize it that as a simple control

1747
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:49,679
loop that is running and this control

1748
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,880
loop might be

1749
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:56,080
influenced by various factors and

1750
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,280
it generally requires low and stable

1751
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:02,320
latencies so just

1752
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,880
to have that as an example here and then

1753
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,759
finally we also want to include

1754
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,440
a section on yeah potential approaches

1755
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,679
where we think that

1756
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,519
it might be a good idea to to highlight

1757
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:16,560
how stuff is currently

1758
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,280
implemented maybe or how we would

1759
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,360
envision it to be implemented using coin

1760
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:25,920
um and then also um perhaps formulate

1761
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:27,360
some kind of research questions so to to

1762
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,640
actually

1763
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:33,920
um state what is really the the

1764
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,320
central idea of of this use case and

1765
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,679
what is the the real value for for this

1766
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,159
use case

1767
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,120
um and in the case of the network

1768
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:44,400
control

1769
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:47,679
um we would hear or we've put here

1770
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,519
that we want to have an approximated

1771
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,159
imprecise control

1772
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:53,040
um in the network for a faster response

1773
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,360
and then all

1774
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,360
having slower responses coming from a

1775
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,639
far so from a central

1776
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,239
position maybe and one of the biggest

1777
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,600
questions here or all the research

1778
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,919
questions mainly

1779
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,360
revolve around the question how the

1780
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,400
different approximations that we might

1781
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,440
use here

1782
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,480
can actually be derived

1783
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:17,839
um yeah then

1784
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,360
our main goal as i said is not only to

1785
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,840
collect the different use cases but then

1786
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:23,199
also

1787
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,960
make something out of them um and

1788
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:26,879
here i already said that we want to

1789
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,440
create some form of taxonomy

1790
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,040
um and for that we want to then actually

1791
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,719
use these the structure that we have for

1792
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,800
the different use cases so

1793
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,080
the common uh setting with the

1794
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,120
requirements

1795
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,640
um perhaps also analyze algorithmic

1796
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,519
properties of solutions that could be

1797
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,080
applied there

1798
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,400
and then try to find common requirements

1799
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:49,440
common combinations of requirements

1800
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:52,559
uh common building blocks and

1801
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:54,080
then really try to define different

1802
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,280
classes of use case that we have

1803
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,159
so i think the kucha also said something

1804
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,480
similar to that

1805
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:03,360
in this presentation um so this is

1806
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,559
really what we intend this draft to be

1807
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,040
so a collection of classes of use cases

1808
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,120
with

1809
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,640
certain requirements a list of

1810
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,920
requirements maybe

1811
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:17,199
so that then your work can really be

1812
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:19,840
derived from those use cases and then

1813
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,839
yeah really

1814
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,239
focus on certain aspects of the use

1815
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,639
guests or solve problems in

1816
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:28,480
them and the big thing at this point

1817
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,800
here is that we need more use cases for

1818
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,120
that

1819
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,280
uh so currently as i said we only really

1820
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:36,400
have the industrial use cases in there

1821
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:38,719
uh the other use cases from from the

1822
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,839
app center's draft will move over

1823
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:42,640
eventually

1824
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,040
but even then we only would have like

1825
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,159
three

1826
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:48,239
large groups of use cases and so it

1827
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:51,440
would be really

1828
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,839
great if other people here would also

1829
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,040
have

1830
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:58,400
uh the interest of uh contributing

1831
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,840
use cases so uh the um

1832
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,839
in the first presentation we had like

1833
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,199
this a at itu

1834
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,760
ai to the edge use cases with the auto

1835
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,320
and the

1836
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,280
cyber cases so that sounded uh really

1837
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,440
interesting

1838
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,040
and um yeah thus we really open and

1839
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,799
looking for

1840
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,239
collaborators at this point um so that

1841
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,600
we can then

1842
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:20,159
increase the diversity of the use cases

1843
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,560
and then

1844
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:23,839
really find interesting requirements and

1845
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,480
then um

1846
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,120
yeah hopefully get a good basis for a

1847
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:32,559
future work at this point

1848
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:35,760
um yeah so this is then now the

1849
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,520
last slide um yeah we were not really

1850
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,239
sure about our status as a research

1851
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,400
group draft

1852
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:42,239
um but in the beginning we solved that

1853
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,679
so let's skip over it so that last is

1854
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:46,639
happy also

1855
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,040
um yeah what do we need for our draft

1856
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,920
now

1857
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,480
um we really need input on our approach

1858
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,239
on

1859
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:53,839
how we want to describe and include use

1860
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:55,440
cases so if this

1861
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,320
separation and characterization and

1862
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,559
requirements and approaches make sense

1863
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:01,599
if you guys have um better ideas for

1864
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:04,719
that please

1865
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,960
tell them um so that we can then really

1866
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:08,000
improve the approach here and perhaps

1867
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,760
maybe

1868
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,440
make it more easy for other people to

1869
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:14,239
contribute as well

1870
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:14,879
um yeah we also need new contributors

1871
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:18,000
with new

1872
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,440
new use cases um so we'll add the the

1873
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,560
draft sources to the

1874
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:25,040
research group um github soon so then

1875
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,280
um yeah text contributions should be

1876
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:30,239
really easy

1877
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,519
um and yeah the plans for the immediate

1878
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,599
future are that we will

1879
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,280
uh first move the use cases over from

1880
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,920
the app centers draft

1881
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:42,960
um and then um yeah and follow our

1882
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,760
own um guidelines regarding the

1883
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,920
descriptions

1884
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:47,679
of the use cases there and then as soon

1885
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,199
as we have enough use cases

1886
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,040
to to uh we also want to

1887
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:54,639
start with a rough analysis of of the

1888
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:57,519
use cases so that we can then

1889
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,760
um yeah start in the right in the

1890
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,760
direction of the economy

1891
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,199
and yeah with that i would already be at

1892
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,400
the end and

1893
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:07,040
hopefully now a lot of people show up in

1894
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,120
the

1895
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,800
queue saying that they want to

1896
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,320
contribute to

1897
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,320
the draft so thanks

1898
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,840
ah thank you um

1899
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:33,759
i'm in the queue but who else is there i

1900
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,760
see dirk and the queue

1901
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:40,239
dirk trust thanks thanks um

1902
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,600
just to continue on on on what like as

1903
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,959
presented but also connecting to you

1904
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,400
what um

1905
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:48,080
dirk had said before uh

1906
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:49,440
the taxonomy part is going to be a

1907
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,920
really important one i would really like

1908
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,000
to invite

1909
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,760
also contributors specifically to that

1910
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,600
as well it's not only just a new use

1911
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,800
case but also taxonomy

1912
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,560
because i think one of the critical

1913
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,920
pieces in the use cases first we get a

1914
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,520
place where they are where they are

1915
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,280
are gathered that was the first idea of

1916
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:05,280
merging things and i will

1917
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,040
say that later in our own draft but

1918
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:08,320
we're going to to do that so just to

1919
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,120
move them out of individual drafts

1920
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,000
that's a good thing

1921
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,599
but it also allows us to essentially

1922
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,199
look at the use case and make sense out

1923
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,400
of them i think doug's common about

1924
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:20,000
um there's a lot of edge and cloud here

1925
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,360
is a very important one it also takes

1926
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,159
back what i mentioned before in the data

1927
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:26,239
discovery

1928
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:28,000
i think key to the use cases will be to

1929
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:29,678
a little bit sort them out or at least

1930
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,679
find a taxonomy that kind of

1931
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,440
allows us to point out what are the

1932
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:36,159
coins specific one and coin

1933
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,719
again not just computation which

1934
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,400
sometimes

1935
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:39,840
leads us to entry use cases but the

1936
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,280
in-network part

1937
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:44,159
and that's kind of like what i'm looking

1938
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:45,120
for in the taxonomy to find out what are

1939
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,920
aspects that we

1940
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:50,000
can use in the taxonomy to look at those

1941
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,760
use cases from that perspective

1942
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,199
to really sort out the ones that are

1943
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,960
still interesting and cool i mean

1944
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:57,040
there's nothing wrong with the use cases

1945
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,480
but the ones that are more relevant to

1946
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:02,000
the networking part

1947
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:04,879
um and and are not just in the expo it's

1948
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,280
just edge cases or cloud cases um which

1949
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,040
which

1950
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:08,559
might have an interest of their own but

1951
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,040
maybe doesn't add much to the networking

1952
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,800
part

1953
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:12,159
sets the taxonomy a bit that's i think

1954
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,159
really really important

1955
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,159
and and i'd really like to see anybody's

1956
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:18,239
good ideas to that

1957
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,920
as well another thing i just looked for

1958
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,799
the participant list because i wasn't

1959
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,320
entirely sure

1960
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:27,120
if he would join given the early time um

1961
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:29,360
but i will connect that to ike directly

1962
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,480
i had spoken to a potential

1963
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,639
contributor from ucl on use cases

1964
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,839
so probably given that i can't seem at

1965
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,719
the moment

1966
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,400
in the participant list i probably will

1967
01:17:38,719 --> 01:17:41,760
just make the connection so we may have

1968
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:45,120
already a contributor there

1969
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,560
just wanted to make people aware of that

1970
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:50,800
who is that um david griffin and miguel

1971
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,280
i'm not sure if miguel is here i didn't

1972
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:56,480
scroll that far down no he's not right

1973
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,280
from ucl we've been talking to them

1974
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:01,678
about

1975
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:04,000
use cases related to arts and theater

1976
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,480
and how some of them being extremely

1977
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,159
demanding

1978
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,759
on the network and how the network might

1979
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,719
help but again the question there would

1980
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,120
be

1981
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,520
how can in networking functionality

1982
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:18,159
really help or is it all down to

1983
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,560
intelligent maybe edge software which is

1984
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:20,000
still

1985
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,120
an interesting use case but maybe not

1986
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,120
that relevant for this group

1987
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,760
thanks

1988
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,600
um i was the other person in the queue

1989
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,440
and it was just to tell you guys that if

1990
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,679
you need my help to move the

1991
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,719
material from my expired draft into

1992
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,400
yours i'd be more than happy

1993
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,719
i was supposed to get help from other

1994
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,199
people to update it but if it's just

1995
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,679
like

1996
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:45,599
update you know making it it was a use

1997
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,000
case anyway so i'd be more than happy to

1998
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:54,080
use it as a use case and yours

1999
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:56,080
sounds great thanks

2000
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,199
so i don't see any other people in the

2001
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,080
queue

2002
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,639
so thanks again thank you very much uh

come on you're three hours behind me

2020
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:50,560
don't start i know

2021
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:54,800
i know uh this one

2022
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:59,520
was um transport is it the transport

2023
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,520
yeah okay and let's do this

2024
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:06,159
okay oops sorry yeah yeah there you go

2025
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:08,159
yes yeah thank you um hello everybody

2026
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:10,000
i'm rich kasai i'm from uh preferred

2027
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:12,159
networks and white project

2028
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,000
uh i'm talk i'm going to talk about

2029
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:16,799
separation of database and data from

2030
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,520
subreddits in the trust trailer this

2031
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,840
draft is

2032
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,639
uh proposed for transport layer and a

2033
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,840
tsp

2034
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:26,560
uh working group but uh some

2035
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,159
of the topics are related to the

2036
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,800
intellectual computing and clinicality

2037
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:32,000
so

2038
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,639
i want to talk about that here so thank

2039
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,320
you for

2040
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:38,560
taking your time and uh um

2041
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,840
uh yeah we started thinking about the

2042
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,520
layering architecture for the new

2043
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,560
distributed computing paradigms

2044
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,120
including the

2045
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,560
mobile or multi-access edge computing

2046
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,320
and integer computing

2047
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:50,320
i personally think the requirement for

2048
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:52,239
the transportation protocol is different

2049
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,280
by computation models such as the data

2050
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:55,759
center networking

2051
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:56,719
or geographically distributed

2052
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:00,080
environment

2053
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:02,000
so i'd like to begin with more

2054
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,920
general learning architecture rather

2055
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,040
than specific protocols to extract the

2056
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,639
common functionality

2057
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:11,280
for the future protocol development and

2058
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:13,520
yeah as you know the internet has been

2059
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,800
based on the end-to-end principle

2060
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:18,639
so they are complicated on a complex

2061
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,600
functionality is implemented

2062
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,800
at the end host and the network

2063
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,920
intermediate network

2064
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:29,840
is done so

2065
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,840
according to the entertainment principle

2066
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:34,639
but recently the network becomes more

2067
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,839
smarter

2068
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:41,440
so qos is introduced middle boxes are

2069
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,000
everywhere and recently new distributed

2070
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,320
computing

2071
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,360
products such as the edge computing in

2072
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:48,719
data computing

2073
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,960
are introduced so non-trans uh

2074
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,719
so middle boxes introduce a

2075
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:56,080
non-transparent functionality

2076
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,639
that may be added by that that requires

2077
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,159
to load

2078
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:01,360
package to middle boxes our patent-based

2079
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:03,920
uh

2080
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,000
pcbs routing or software defined

2081
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,239
networking technologies

2082
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,719
distributed computing paradigms are

2083
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:13,919
required to

2084
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:16,719
make the network smart and these

2085
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:18,400
often use overall networks to allow the

2086
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:24,960
parties to the

2087
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:28,239
target computing resources next please

2088
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,679
yeah thank you so i started thinking

2089
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:32,159
about the transported

2090
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:33,760
layer functionality to separate the

2091
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:35,360
functionality into the multiple

2092
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,760
layer for the future protocol

2093
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:40,239
development so in this draft i

2094
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,679
separate i divide the transport layer

2095
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:43,839
into two sub layers

2096
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:45,520
one is the data path layer and the the

2097
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,520
other is the data flow layer

2098
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,960
that past three year is related to the

2099
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,440
data path as its

2100
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,440
name and the data flow manages the data

2101
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,960
flow or more more complicated

2102
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,919
uh protocol handling for the data flow

2103
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:02,480
so that first layer uh the the

2104
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:05,040
functionality for the data path layer

2105
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:07,040
is the following for example the

2106
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:10,159
trajectory or waypoint handling

2107
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,840
to us a designated waypoint for the uh

2108
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,519
some kind of flows and the

2109
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,719
bi-directional connection

2110
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,280
and resource management for the

2111
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,440
networking such as condition control

2112
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,719
and the data flow much stretching over

2113
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,360
the one path

2114
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:25,360
and padded duplication may be

2115
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,839
implemented for particles recovery for

2116
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,199
roshi

2117
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:32,159
network or links like fake

2118
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:33,678
and over the data path data flow layer

2119
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,519
uh

2120
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:37,360
add some functionality about the

2121
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:41,280
transmission flow control

2122
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:43,679
low prioritization engine security or

2123
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:46,000
multi-pass protocol functionality so

2124
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:49,120
data flow protocol requires

2125
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,320
more memory to handle the redress

2126
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,760
machine or buffer

2127
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:56,480
dc battery management so

2128
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,120
i'm going to show some use in this draft

2129
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,400
i

2130
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:03,599
write i wrote some use cases of this

2131
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:07,280
draft but in this presentation i'm gonna

2132
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,280
dig into the in-network computing

2133
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,679
so in network computing i don't i think

2134
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,199
i don't need to

2135
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,960
say something about that because

2136
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:18,400
everywhere are specialists

2137
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:22,080
but the electoral computing has been

2138
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:25,920
researched maybe more than 30 years

2139
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:29,120
and the active network is one of the

2140
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,639
the beginning research early research of

2141
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,239
the internet of computing

2142
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,679
and then the recent read is the

2143
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:36,959
substructure training

2144
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:39,040
has been discussed in the iedf and

2145
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,040
in the data center networking data

2146
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:44,320
aggregation distributions

2147
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,080
uh used for is used for all

2148
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,320
reduced procedure for the distributed

2149
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:51,760
development so electro computing has

2150
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:55,519
been forecast recently again

2151
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,520
oh sorry next please

2152
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:06,000
next please i i have talked about

2153
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:06,000
this right yeah sorry uh and next please

2154
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:13,840
so but the computation model for the

2155
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:17,440
inner computing varies by the um

2156
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,960
the applications so this is the simplest

2157
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:24,320
um initial computing model so nothing

2158
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:27,440
in no intermediate levels

2159
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:30,960
stores any state of the computation and

2160
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:34,080
database information so programs

2161
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:36,159
are installed deployed in some

2162
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:38,840
in-network computing components

2163
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:40,480
or in network computing routers like

2164
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:44,080
this

2165
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:47,599
and the packet going through the louder

2166
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:51,199
is processed according to the program

2167
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:54,560
but these routers don't store any state

2168
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,519
of the package or database so in that in

2169
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,000
such case

2170
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,639
we can leverage ecmp global customer

2171
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,480
pass

2172
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:05,520
because the uh the data path is not uh

2173
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:09,839
is not required to be uh cared

2174
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,840
for the united computing

2175
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:14,080
so this is the simplest uh computing

2176
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:17,759
model for the inventor computing

2177
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:20,719
but usually uh this isn't

2178
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:21,840
yeah the more complex they are the

2179
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,440
computation model

2180
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,440
is used so next please

2181
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,920
so usually the part is

2182
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,040
the database is more important for the

2183
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,840
internet of computing

2184
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,639
because the different programs may be

2185
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:41,440
deployed

2186
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:44,239
at the allowance so therefore each flow

2187
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:46,879
and each flow needs to care needs to be

2188
01:26:44,239 --> 01:26:51,120
aware of the database and the waypoints

2189
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:54,400
to apply the program to the budget

2190
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:56,960
so in such cases

2191
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:58,480
for for example the function

2192
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,760
satisfactory chaining

2193
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:04,799
uh uses the policy based routing or

2194
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:08,239
segment value or sfc protocols to

2195
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:11,600
classify the packet which

2196
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:13,599
were to be loaded so

2197
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:15,520
in this model a waypoint must be

2198
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:19,360
designated and controlled

2199
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:22,639
so virus requests to manage the state

2200
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,960
for the database but uh each router i

2201
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,360
mean

2202
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,000
it inc initial computing router do not

2203
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,599
store

2204
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:32,480
any state of the packet so it just

2205
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:35,440
applies a program to the to each bucket

2206
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,440
without any state

2207
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,480
next please

2208
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,679
so um this is the uh the uh the bureau

2209
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,880
failure bureau

2210
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:50,639
is the um the example of the layering

2211
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:54,320
for this computation model so the

2212
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:56,400
data path needs to be aware

2213
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,360
in this computation model but the data

2214
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:00,239
flow

2215
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,440
uh i mean that the emitter computing

2216
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:03,759
routers

2217
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,960
do not store any state so that they

2218
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:08,800
don't require

2219
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:10,800
any um flow control or

2220
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,080
um the transmission between the uh

2221
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,840
routers at the end

2222
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,840
and host next please

2223
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:24,880
but usually the initial computing

2224
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:27,280
is more complex so they require

2225
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,960
to aggregate the data as multiple

2226
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:32,000
packets or

2227
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,880
compute using multiple packets in the

2228
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,320
flow

2229
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:39,520
so they the interconfiguring routers or

2230
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:40,880
node requires to target multiple rows to

2231
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,840
perform data aggregation

2232
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,840
processing

2233
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,880
so in next please

2234
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:55,840
so in this model the

2235
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:57,679
initial computing routers need to

2236
01:28:55,840 --> 01:29:00,400
terminate the data flow so

2237
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,880
they uh introduce the data flow rate

2238
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,638
they

2239
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:03,920
need to implement a data flow layer

2240
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:08,159
protocol at the

2241
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:11,679
network computing node

2242
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:14,239
next please

2243
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:16,159
so i will have one minute so so this is

2244
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:17,839
the summary so i propose a separation of

2245
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:20,638
data and data flow layers

2246
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:21,760
so that path uh is to be aware of

2247
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,320
network resources and

2248
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,960
trajectory or waypoints the data flow

2249
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,360
layer

2250
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,280
is to be aware of computing resources

2251
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,320
and flow level integrity

2252
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,800
the next step is to improve the ide by

2253
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:38,639
adding analysis of existing protocols

2254
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:41,280
and adding more use cases and example

2255
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:43,120
and i think we need to propose some

2256
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,800
protocols for that path layer and the

2257
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:53,840
data flow layers

2258
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:53,840
so thank you for listening

2259
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,400
thank you very much uh is there anybody

2260
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,440
in the yes there's two people in the

2261
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:10,559
queue

2262
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:15,280
uh curity and

2263
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,280
the world first dirk should i go uh

2264
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:22,480
and then jord okay um

2265
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,320
i don't know who's going first go ahead

2266
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,440
york

2267
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:32,080
okay um thanks um

2268
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:35,599
yeah things are interesting so um

2269
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:37,280
i mean most often um compute functions

2270
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,280
you know want to do something on the

2271
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:42,559
payload so with the application

2272
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:46,239
data um so what

2273
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:49,520
security model should we apply for

2274
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:52,638
you know your data flow layers

2275
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,480
i mean would you terminate a security

2276
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:57,520
context in the network or

2277
01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:00,718
how would that look like so

2278
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:03,840
i think uh the security function is

2279
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:07,360
to be implemented on the data flow layer

2280
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,679
because it buffers uh the data and the

2281
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,719
payload i mean the protocol level

2282
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:14,239
payload

2283
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:16,560
uh portable data unit so

2284
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,360
i think the security or encryption

2285
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,040
should be

2286
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:23,920
um applied in the dataflow layer

2287
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,920
not the data path

2288
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:27,199
okay thanks

2289
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:32,960
hey um i have a question if you go back

2290
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:36,239
one slide

2291
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:40,080
i think it's one slide oops

2292
01:31:36,239 --> 01:31:40,080
in this mode hang on

2293
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:47,120
it's like it's just like um yes this one

2294
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:50,000
so um if you look at the data flow layer

2295
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:51,840
where you got the data flow

2296
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,679
connecting to another data flow layer

2297
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:56,719
connecting to the end

2298
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:58,000
data flow layer the application layer is

2299
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,239
expecting something

2300
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,320
and typically they just expect that the

2301
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:03,759
packets go from here to here and then

2302
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:06,639
they'll deal with it

2303
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:08,159
if the data flow layer in introduces

2304
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:11,280
some compute

2305
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:13,759
um what's i mean if you think of

2306
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,880
the left as an end user on the right as

2307
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:19,040
the cloud

2308
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,040
you know your your usual

2309
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,320
content network or whatever and in the

2310
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,520
middle

2311
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:27,599
someone is doing something

2312
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,800
what's the end-to-end expectation

2313
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,679
anymore

2314
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,480
that you know the application sends

2315
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,480
something from

2316
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:36,480
from the left and the right wants to

2317
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:38,239
take it and do some compute on it but in

2318
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:40,480
the middle somebody's already done some

2319
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:42,638
other computer on it and it's

2320
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,959
not only security but what is the

2321
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,040
end-to-end correctness of what is going

2322
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,520
on

2323
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:51,280
yeah good point yeah i think we need to

2324
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:52,320
all think about that point in more

2325
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:55,120
detail

2326
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,759
in future but i think the application

2327
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,880
layer

2328
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:02,320
needs to take care the

2329
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:06,080
service level functionality of substance

2330
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:09,679
something i mean the um the

2331
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,320
usually the um application specified the

2332
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,199
service

2333
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:16,159
uh identifier instead of the uh this

2334
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:19,280
kind of the middle boxes or

2335
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:20,400
um the waypoints of the computing

2336
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:23,440
computation

2337
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:27,040
so application layer should handle

2338
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:30,320
the such kind of the service level uh

2339
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:33,519
integrity or serviceable um

2340
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,000
functionality i think but uh i think we

2341
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:37,440
need to

2342
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,400
discuss more about that but then it

2343
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,960
should be aware

2344
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:41,519
of the midpoints and what's going on or

2345
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,080
at least

2346
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:44,800
that there exists midpoints because

2347
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,159
otherwise

2348
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:51,440
you how do you guarantee

2349
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:54,799
end-to-end correctness

2350
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:57,360
oh yeah right uh i think uh this draft

2351
01:33:54,800 --> 01:34:00,719
focuses on the data playing function

2352
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:02,159
so i think control plane requires to

2353
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:05,280
manage the

2354
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:07,759
how to load or where should be

2355
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,040
uh the waypoint for this functionality

2356
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:12,400
or for this service

2357
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:14,639
so the application layer should

2358
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,920
control certain things and the data

2359
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:19,360
translator in the data

2360
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:23,360
flow layer is used for the

2361
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:26,400
date plane protocol i think

2362
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,239
in my opinion okay um

2363
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,440
i think it's worth thinking more but

2364
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:33,839
yeah thanks thank you

2365
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:33,839
yeah thank you very much

2366
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,599
uh maybe we can take one last fast

2367
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,119
question

2368
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:47,679
and send uh the rest of the queue to

2369
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:50,080
uh um

2370
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,280
mailing list or actually i see nobody on

2371
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:53,280
slack but that's okay

2372
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,679
i usually say to continue discussion on

2373
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:58,800
slack uh so dirk or uma

2374
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,960
uh yeah so it's a quick question

2375
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,000
i think thanks for the good presentation

2376
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,679
so i have my

2377
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,960
question is uh you uh pointed the active

2378
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,320
networks in the beginning of the

2379
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,520
presentation

2380
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:14,080
uh and the first question recalls asked

2381
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,760
it's mostly massaging the payload right

2382
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,960
with the data flow layer with the small

2383
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,360
program there

2384
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,119
so is that the use case you have in mind

2385
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:24,320
or

2386
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:27,679
so are you doing anything which is

2387
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:28,080
not to not to do with the payload right

2388
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:30,080
but

2389
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:33,440
still applying some service the compute

2390
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,440
service on the packet here

2391
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:37,119
so uh yesterday i don't have any

2392
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,759
specific

2393
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:40,719
or use cases for the application layer

2394
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,920
but the

2395
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,280
uh the we want uh the one of the

2396
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,320
application

2397
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,960
uh is of this um

2398
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,360
i can say uh of this pro uh the draft is

2399
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,639
that

2400
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:57,440
is to is for the data collection so

2401
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:58,560
we collect many data from the sense

2402
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,000
sensors from

2403
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,199
in the iod so in such cases we need to

2404
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,119
collect the

2405
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:06,320
many data that some of the data should

2406
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:09,519
be aggregated to

2407
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:12,159
reduce the storage cost so

2408
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:13,840
that is one of the use cases uh we are

2409
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:15,360
thinking about

2410
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:17,040
so in that case you are not talking

2411
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,639
about any application payload right so

2412
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,000
you are just collecting and aggregating

2413
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:22,840
the compute function is basically

2414
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,920
aggregation of the data

2415
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:30,480
yep okay thanks

2416
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:33,520
um okay thank you uh so we're it's 136

2417
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:34,959
i know uh here i know that they were

2418
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,119
they're going to cut us after five

2419
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:40,159
minutes past so we still have

2420
01:36:37,119 --> 01:36:43,119
four presentations uh dirk

2421
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:45,679
uh drossen you're the next one do you

2422
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:45,679
think you could

2423
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:53,839
yes again thank you

2424
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:59,199
dirk dirk drosson you're the next one

2425
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:02,320
and you have two

2426
01:36:59,199 --> 01:37:04,559
i was thinking could you make them

2427
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:06,480
shorter a little bit instead of 20

2428
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,600
minutes making them shorter

2429
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:12,080
so that they squeeze in this time

2430
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:13,360
yeah i will try i will try certainly

2431
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:15,360
there they are so that

2432
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,280
so that at least the inner gets some

2433
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:19,599
time and that we get at least five

2434
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:22,880
minutes for philip at the end

2435
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,880
yeah i will i'll do my best um

2436
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,639
eve i don't know are you able to share

2437
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,000
the slides or did i send them too late

2438
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,800
otherwise i'll try to share them

2439
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,840
i think you sent them too late i don't

2440
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,840
have them queued up here

2441
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:45,119
yes we will do that you are granted

2442
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:50,960
okay thanks that's also useful because i

2443
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:53,760
can do both of them

2444
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:54,400
uh from the same share here so yes the

2445
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,480
um

2446
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:58,638
the transfer i i hope you can see that i

2447
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:02,320
hope i'm still sharing the right screen

2448
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:05,040
yes you are good good um

2449
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,880
so i only copied the abstract here but

2450
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,760
the important sentence the very last one

2451
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,520
um so the

2452
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,280
various questions that at the moment are

2453
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:12,480
being asked about transport protocols in

2454
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,880
connection with coin

2455
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,320
and again the the last subset is very

2456
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,840
important to the point i also made

2457
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,519
before

2458
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,960
we outline a number of research

2459
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,679
challenges and use cases

2460
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:24,239
for that in the draft and from the

2461
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:25,679
structure

2462
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:27,519
these are the main updates so again this

2463
01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:27,840
is only an update on an ongoing draft

2464
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:30,880
and

2465
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,159
focusing on the updates um discuss later

2466
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,159
a couple of the updates we made in

2467
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:35,759
addressing and flow granularity we added

2468
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,519
a new section five

2469
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,360
on collective communication and multi

2470
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,600
for multi-party communication

2471
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:43,280
and the challenges that transport has in

2472
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,000
that area

2473
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:46,880
and we also renamed section 8 which was

2474
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,199
the previous

2475
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,719
uh obviously different numbering before

2476
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:53,199
into transport features where we

2477
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:56,560
discussed reliability and flow

2478
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:58,638
and updated the subsections so on

2479
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,320
section three what we've largely done

2480
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:03,840
initially at least um given

2481
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:05,360
that that um i um uh kindly invited me

2482
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,360
to join as a co-author

2483
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,040
is to make linkages to other work and

2484
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,400
that's not meant to be limiting

2485
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:11,840
it's limiting at the moment but we're

2486
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,119
not limiting obviously to craft to that

2487
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,360
because we invite later

2488
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:16,239
to make other links as well so here are

2489
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,080
specifically

2490
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:20,080
uh links to the service routing

2491
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:20,480
discussion in the adjacent draft which

2492
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,880
i'll

2493
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:24,239
present later separately the app center

2494
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:26,320
draft

2495
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:29,040
we also amended the research questions

2496
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:30,239
by various aspects on node selection

2497
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,560
constraint

2498
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:34,799
based decision of that selection and

2499
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,920
also representing the treatment by coin

2500
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,239
nodes uh there are

2501
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:39,840
several research questions if you recall

2502
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:41,519
the structure of the traffic you always

2503
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,280
ask a number of research questions in

2504
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,560
each of these subsections so we amended

2505
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:48,239
these aspects

2506
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:49,199
in section three uh on float granularity

2507
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:52,239
we had a text

2508
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:53,919
uh on the notion of short-term messages

2509
01:39:52,239 --> 01:39:55,440
versus the long

2510
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:57,920
term resource management between

2511
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:59,599
endpoints so to possibly separate the

2512
01:39:57,920 --> 01:40:02,080
message and transaction handling from

2513
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,679
the resource management

2514
01:40:02,080 --> 01:40:05,600
aspect for a number of reasons that are

2515
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,520
discussed in the draft

2516
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,280
um in particular by error control on the

2517
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,719
messages and the contestion control on

2518
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:14,159
the endpoint relation

2519
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:16,000
itself over a longer period um

2520
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:17,599
and and that has an impact that we've

2521
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
done this between discussing draft is it

2522
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,840
has an

2523
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,239
impact on what could be executed where

2524
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,080
by

2525
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:27,440
coin nodes that's the reason why we've

2526
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:29,199
done that in the draft

2527
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:30,879
this actually is new mentioned before

2528
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:33,199
and has been done with a linkage again

2529
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:36,719
to the app center draft which comes

2530
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:38,638
next and it talks about possibly

2531
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,000
ephemeral and short-lived multi-point

2532
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:42,080
communication

2533
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,760
um that is being done there there are i

2534
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,440
think at least two use cases in the

2535
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,360
absence of draft that talk about this

2536
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:51,040
it's a multiple communication that

2537
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:51,920
may uh occur even at the request level

2538
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:54,320
only

2539
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:55,840
and that questions the viability of

2540
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,920
current transport solutions which we

2541
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:01,040
discuss in this new section

2542
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:04,639
and the possibility for

2543
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:06,639
coin nodes to support aspects that

2544
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,239
you would need to do from a transfer

2545
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,440
perspective for instance group division

2546
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:11,839
into subgroups

2547
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:15,280
is one of the aspects we identify that

2548
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,280
coin nodes could be helped with

2549
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,600
updates on section 8 again different

2550
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,600
numbering before um we renamed this

2551
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,679
section to transport features and they

2552
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,000
cover reliability and congestion control

2553
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,560
uh

2554
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,840
subsections um we have several

2555
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,679
amendments in the

2556
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,600
in the two subsection reliability we

2557
01:41:29,679 --> 01:41:32,159
mentioned for instance the the possible

2558
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,800
opportunity

2559
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:35,360
to use coin nodes in relation to network

2560
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,440
coding

2561
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:38,799
uh for reliability that's one aspect

2562
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,839
there um

2563
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,520
we also added again a

2564
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:45,119
question on the what's the unit of

2565
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:46,080
reliability so we link this to the

2566
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,839
previous discussion

2567
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:50,000
in the flow granularity section as to

2568
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,679
what's the unit of reliability

2569
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,600
that one should look at so we try to

2570
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:55,199
connect these two texts

2571
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,440
and also edit the question on the

2572
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:59,280
possible use of multi-source

2573
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,559
which was missing before and how would

2574
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:03,040
you handle that with respect to

2575
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,880
reliability

2576
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:07,280
in flowing congestion control we added a

2577
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,600
discussion that we again linked to

2578
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,519
the back to the float granularity

2579
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,239
section on separating air and flow

2580
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,840
control

2581
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:15,519
and also the impact of collective

2582
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,400
communication in particular when you

2583
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:19,040
have

2584
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,599
uh potentially forward unicast requests

2585
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,920
and a

2586
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,639
and a single multicast response how do

2587
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,960
you

2588
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:27,280
separate or how do you join the flow

2589
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,400
controls into potential

2590
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:31,840
ephemeral uh resource management regime

2591
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,519
that you can use for the multicast

2592
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,880
response there are some texts and there

2593
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,880
as well

2594
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,080
and again always trying to link this

2595
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,639
somehow to

2596
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:42,080
how coin can help um in particular the

2597
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:44,080
in-networking part so

2598
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,400
um i know i keep repeating that but it's

2599
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:49,040
important

2600
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:51,199
what are the future plans again some of

2601
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:52,560
this work has happened fairly recent to

2602
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:55,440
the itf so so we're

2603
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,080
intending to operate update this you

2604
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:58,000
know quite

2605
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:59,199
quickly it's a clearer linkage to the

2606
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,040
various use cases

2607
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:02,960
in the revised use case draft that's

2608
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:04,960
again where also

2609
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:06,239
let's say draft wise and linkage-wise

2610
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:07,760
things become a bit easier because you

2611
01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:09,440
can just link to a single draft

2612
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,679
increasingly hopefully

2613
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:13,040
and also hopefully rely to an emerging

2614
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:15,040
taxonomy that we can

2615
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:16,719
link to from the transport craft so

2616
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,719
there are these kind of things more

2617
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:21,920
sense making in linkages

2618
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:23,920
in a way that we intend to increase also

2619
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:24,800
linkage to other coin crafts we we did

2620
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,400
um

2621
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:30,159
extend the references already and they

2622
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,440
will i mean there's a lot of work and

2623
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:32,480
non collective communication for

2624
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:34,719
instance that

2625
01:43:32,480 --> 01:43:36,480
has there has been a little bit edited

2626
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:36,719
edit but that can be a lot more added

2627
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,040
and

2628
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:40,239
we also want to obviously edit at other

2629
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:41,840
drafts and

2630
01:43:40,239 --> 01:43:44,000
the relevant work that's being discussed

2631
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:45,600
there on computing frameworks

2632
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,760
programmable forwarding nodes the

2633
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:50,719
microservice draft i mentioned already

2634
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,560
so we again create the linkages for the

2635
01:43:50,719 --> 01:43:56,639
overall sense making

2636
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:58,400
um as i also mentioned uh before

2637
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,400
for the use cases i think similar

2638
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:02,080
applies here for the transport

2639
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,320
to turn the research questions into

2640
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:06,559
something like a requirements language

2641
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,759
so that we can shake that out and maybe

2642
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,520
at some point even discuss

2643
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,199
where to collect all those requirements

2644
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:14,480
that's a little bit further down

2645
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:15,919
more for the research group overall

2646
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,360
obviously we would like to have more

2647
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,040
input and i think yeah that's that's

2648
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:20,239
more important and mostly important to

2649
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:20,880
get more people involved in the

2650
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:23,280
discussion

2651
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,400
um and hence the call for more

2652
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:26,159
contributors

2653
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,839
uh and we also asked the question here

2654
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:30,080
but we maybe we can skip that

2655
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,440
given the discussion we had to adopt

2656
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:32,559
that as a research draft that

2657
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,919
at this stage we want to have more

2658
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:38,480
contributors to start with

2659
01:44:35,920 --> 01:44:42,080
that was it and i hope that made it at

2660
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:42,080
least i shaved up a few minutes

2661
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:45,280
thank you so much

2662
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:52,639
um and i will

2663
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,920
cut the uh those i i don't know this

2664
01:44:52,639 --> 01:44:56,719
i don't think there's anybody in the

2665
01:44:53,920 --> 01:45:00,400
queue no so

2666
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:03,520
uh so we can move to

2667
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:07,199
um the next

2668
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:10,480
um the expectation yes

2669
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:12,799
um yeah so can you go even faster around

2670
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:16,000
this one

2671
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,880
oh okay good uh my my english language

2672
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,480
skills

2673
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:22,239
um same structure here you can read it

2674
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,000
later um general structure

2675
01:45:22,239 --> 01:45:25,678
we still include the use cases but they

2676
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,159
will be moved off we have a

2677
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:29,440
very very fine small refinements in

2678
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:30,799
there for the update and that will all

2679
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,239
be carried over the use case graph

2680
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:35,360
that's an easy one

2681
01:45:32,239 --> 01:45:36,879
we do have requirements again um we

2682
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,480
leave them here they're derived from the

2683
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,159
use case and then we'll see where that

2684
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,638
makes sense in any of the other crafts

2685
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:42,400
either

2686
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:44,560
we carry them over in the use case draft

2687
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,679
or if any requirements traffic merges i

2688
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,639
think we can take them

2689
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:50,880
they are quite a few which is good um

2690
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:52,639
what we do for now is we will update

2691
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:54,960
them in the next revision with a clear

2692
01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,480
linkage to our own section five

2693
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,239
but then when the requirements move

2694
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:59,280
elsewhere we have to restore those

2695
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:03,199
linkages

2696
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:06,320
so the main focus has actually been on

2697
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:08,879
number five on the enabling technologies

2698
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:09,920
and we added more tags in a number of

2699
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:12,159
subsections

2700
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,199
we added new text in in section five one

2701
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:17,199
in the ones that are

2702
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:20,239
shown red either new text or edit text

2703
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:21,119
there so on the compute interconnection

2704
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,599
layer two we

2705
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:24,719
we there added references to use l2

2706
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,600
switching for interconnecting

2707
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,600
distributed complete

2708
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:29,440
resources and linked to efforts that are

2709
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,280
going on at the moment

2710
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:34,719
in 3dpp and generally in the area of

2711
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:36,400
edge computing in 5g

2712
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:39,119
there's some references added and some

2713
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:42,559
text but discuss those

2714
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:44,239
and and um and also to um point to the

2715
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,280
service routing in distributed l2

2716
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:47,759
environments

2717
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,759
um as a similar problem to input data

2718
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:51,760
center server scheduling um

2719
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,840
even though here you have a distributed

2720
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,280
layer 2 environment so there's some text

2721
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,119
to that regard

2722
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:59,080
that's it that's a new text um that

2723
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:02,080
wasn't the previous version

2724
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:04,080
5.5 um added text on constraint based

2725
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,280
forwarding decisions so that evolved

2726
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:06,559
from the server

2727
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:08,639
previously that section was called

2728
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:11,600
service pinning and it was only

2729
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:12,239
a placeholder we've now extended the

2730
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,679
draft i

2731
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:16,638
sorry extended the text in an action

2732
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:19,199
text and it extends the

2733
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:21,520
discussion in the subsection before

2734
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:22,000
section 5.4 and service routing by to

2735
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:24,480
include

2736
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,320
constraints into the forwarding decision

2737
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:26,638
uh and the constraints between one or

2738
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,159
more

2739
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,679
uh two to have the following decision

2740
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:33,199
with one one or more

2741
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,600
services and candidates um there a point

2742
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,919
is

2743
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,520
particularly that loaded latency may not

2744
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,400
be the only constraints there are a few

2745
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,679
of them

2746
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:44,559
discussed and again the

2747
01:47:41,679 --> 01:47:45,679
relation to the networking part is in

2748
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,880
the support

2749
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:49,119
of the network in the matching

2750
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,880
operations

2751
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:52,719
because they may need to be coordinated

2752
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,400
across several routers to achieve

2753
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,719
uh the equivalent to a service

2754
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:59,599
scheduling capability that you know from

2755
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,719
intradata center um scheduling of

2756
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,239
service requests

2757
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:03,679
in a distributed setting so there's some

2758
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,080
discussion around there that's where

2759
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,040
again

2760
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:08,639
coin specific comes more in also

2761
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,360
reference to ongoing work

2762
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:12,880
c event dyncast and the itf ic and rg

2763
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:15,360
work et cetera et cetera

2764
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,400
so um and that's not is only a start of

2765
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:19,280
it there will be more

2766
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:22,000
references if possible as i said

2767
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,759
collector communication is new

2768
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,600
as a pattern that exhibited in a number

2769
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:26,880
of microservice scenarios as we have in

2770
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:29,760
the use cases

2771
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:31,199
um to go from not just one to one but

2772
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,440
two multi-point

2773
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:35,360
use cases we also observed that the

2774
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:36,719
patterns may be short-lived in other use

2775
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:40,000
cases you can see that

2776
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:41,760
um through pulling uh various frames and

2777
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,040
they can be as short-lived as single

2778
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,440
requests and uh

2779
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:47,040
and and so here we discuss the

2780
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,239
spontaneous formation of multi-point

2781
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,400
relations

2782
01:48:48,239 --> 01:48:52,480
and we make references here to ongoing

2783
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,799
work that could facilitate those like in

2784
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,080
the be

2785
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,560
a working group there's actually an

2786
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,440
ongoing draft that addresses that for

2787
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:01,600
beer

2788
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:03,280
uh based solution forwarding solutions

2789
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,040
future plans here as i've done before

2790
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:07,040
move the use cases good

2791
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,960
link the requirements for now more

2792
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,800
clearly to section five but then keep in

2793
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,040
mind to potentially move them elsewhere

2794
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,480
if there's requirements work emerging in

2795
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,080
the group we are quite willing to and

2796
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:17,919
happy to do that

2797
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,599
um there are some other bits and pieces

2798
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,440
missing in section five so section five

2799
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:23,599
is the core section for the future plans

2800
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:24,879
to elaborate on to make clearer linkages

2801
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,679
to other crafts to

2802
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,679
references so there's that goes more

2803
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,639
into reality overview work and trying to

2804
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,280
tie in

2805
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:34,560
what's been done elsewhere um ask the

2806
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,040
same question here but that's not that

2807
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:40,400
relevant on the rg draft

2808
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:43,840
good i shift hopefully

2809
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:43,839
again something else

2810
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,360
but i may have lost anybody in the queue

2811
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:52,480
though thank you

2812
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:55,920
uh and again uh we're we're

2813
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:58,718
going to send all questions to

2814
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,280
the mailing list as some people need a

2815
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:02,400
coffee

2816
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:05,759
a tea or sleeping

2817
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,759
in that you're next

2818
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:14,159
yes and uh yes you can

2819
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:15,519
take maybe six seven minutes and

2820
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:18,000
maybe a little bit less time than you

2821
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,560
wanted and uh phillip

2822
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,159
will go a little bit over time to allow

2823
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:25,840
you to at least have

2824
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,839
some minutes to talk about piccolo

2825
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:32,480
okay and we'll cut the we'll cut the

2826
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:34,159
presentation at the end first at the uh

2827
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:37,598
in the interim meeting

2828
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:41,280
on your presentation yeah

2829
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:45,679
i know um okay i

2830
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:45,679
don't know how i can change this

2831
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:55,119
yes so maybe you can share my slides

2832
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:58,880
sure can you un uh unshare

2833
01:50:55,119 --> 01:51:03,920
and then i will yeah

2834
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:03,920
okay then i will take the screen

2835
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,840
okay

2836
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,199
is that your presentation yeah thank you

2837
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:26,239
great

2838
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:28,638
you're very welcome okay yeah so

2839
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:30,400
just on the updated draft on enhancing

2840
01:51:28,639 --> 01:51:31,679
security and privacy within network

2841
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:35,598
computing

2842
01:51:31,679 --> 01:51:38,800
um and yeah next slide so

2843
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:40,560
first a short recap of the draft so the

2844
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,960
underlying problem we want to tackle

2845
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:42,800
here

2846
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:44,239
is that of resource constraints and

2847
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:45,679
legacy devices

2848
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,360
which are increasingly connected to the

2849
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:50,000
internet and also in

2850
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,480
industrial scenarios and therefore there

2851
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,040
are many

2852
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:53,839
sensitive processes and sensitive data

2853
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,239
involved

2854
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,400
but we often have a lack of security and

2855
01:51:56,239 --> 01:52:00,320
privacy mechanisms

2856
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:01,679
and here we see the potential of

2857
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,639
in-network computing

2858
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:05,440
to efficiently retrofit adequate

2859
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,480
solutions

2860
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,598
to this um and in the first version of

2861
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,919
the draft we

2862
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:13,040
already proposed several specific use

2863
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:16,080
cases

2864
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:17,679
so we can imagine to retrofit basic

2865
01:52:16,080 --> 01:52:19,920
protection mechanisms

2866
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:21,119
in the network such as encryption

2867
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,760
integrity checks

2868
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:26,000
authorization authentication but also

2869
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,320
privacy mechanisms

2870
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,000
such that networking devices basically

2871
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:32,960
act as security gateways

2872
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:36,080
and establish secure connections between

2873
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:38,480
inherently insecure devices

2874
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:40,400
however here we have a problem with

2875
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:43,519
current networking hardware is

2876
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:45,598
missing actual cryptochips so

2877
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,360
right at this moment our possibilities

2878
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,400
are a bit limited here

2879
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:53,119
um but we think there is still room for

2880
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,159
a lot of interesting research and we

2881
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:57,519
also hope that

2882
01:52:54,159 --> 01:53:01,519
um yeah edict will be

2883
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:04,239
available in the future um yeah the next

2884
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,960
and this is one subject we are already

2885
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:07,839
actively

2886
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:09,920
working on is the efficient enforcement

2887
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:12,719
of network policies

2888
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,960
so here the goal is to provide a very

2889
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:16,000
fine granular graphic filtering at line

2890
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,320
rate

2891
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,080
and this is very promising as we see

2892
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:23,199
clear performance improvements

2893
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:26,960
in comparison to existing solutions with

2894
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:28,799
similar filtering capabilities

2895
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,480
in a similar sense we also see the

2896
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,960
potential to conduct

2897
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,159
very efficient anomaly detection within

2898
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,119
the network

2899
01:53:34,159 --> 01:53:38,559
and exploit this to enable immediate

2900
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:40,960
reaction to events

2901
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,000
for example by implementing deadman

2902
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,159
switches

2903
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,360
which are automatically triggered by

2904
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:48,879
networking devices

2905
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:52,000
after seeing a conspicuous packet

2906
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:53,440
and last and this is another ongoing

2907
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,440
research project of us

2908
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,559
we also see a high potential to offer a

2909
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:58,879
cost effective

2910
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:00,719
and efficient solution for network

2911
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,719
monitoring

2912
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:04,080
for example by creating comprehensive

2913
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,719
flow records

2914
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:09,280
at networking devices without additional

2915
01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:11,679
hardware or software

2916
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:13,440
um yeah so that's what was already part

2917
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:16,000
of the first draft version and

2918
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:17,360
in the updated draft we now added

2919
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,119
another idea

2920
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:20,639
which i want to present a bit more

2921
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:23,759
detailed so

2922
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:26,719
next slide please

2923
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:29,199
um yeah so we call this in-network

2924
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:32,159
vulnerability patches

2925
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:32,879
and this works a bit similar to anomaly

2926
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:35,280
detection

2927
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,599
and policy enforcement but is more

2928
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:40,639
specific

2929
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:42,239
and yeah a common problem of legacy and

2930
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:44,639
resource constrained devices

2931
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:45,919
is that they are often hard or even

2932
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:47,400
impossible to update

2933
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,599
and therefore later emerging

2934
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:51,920
vulnerabilities cannot be fixed on the

2935
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:54,000
devices themselves

2936
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,119
and furthermore even if updates are

2937
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,360
possible

2938
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:59,519
uh these are often just not conducted

2939
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:02,159
out of ignorance or laziness

2940
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,480
and it's also very time consuming for

2941
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:06,480
hundreds of devices

2942
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:08,320
and here we see again the potential of

2943
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,959
in-network computing

2944
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:13,119
to provide an efficient solution so the

2945
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:15,599
idea here is to basically implement

2946
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:16,159
a signature based intrusion prevention

2947
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:19,199
system

2948
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,679
on networking devices meaning that we

2949
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:22,000
can

2950
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:23,920
define very fine granular traffic

2951
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,400
patterns of noun attacks

2952
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:30,400
and then just drop matching traffic

2953
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:32,638
one advantage here is that such

2954
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:35,119
in-network patches could be easily

2955
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:36,000
or even automatically distributed to

2956
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:38,320
capable

2957
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,080
networking devices for example in the

2958
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:42,320
form of software updates

2959
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,840
and thus this approach offers a high

2960
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:46,880
scalability

2961
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,080
but the main advantage is that the

2962
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:52,080
application

2963
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:54,239
would be at line rate and this is

2964
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:56,159
an important advantage for low latency

2965
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:58,239
scenarios

2966
01:55:56,159 --> 01:55:59,759
but of course we need to conduct

2967
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:02,239
research to evaluate

2968
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,119
how much we can actually benefit from

2969
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:07,440
this approach

2970
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:10,400
in comparison to traditional ips systems

2971
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:13,040
um yeah so that's it for this idea so

2972
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:13,040
next slide

2973
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,679
yeah to wrap this up already this draft

2974
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,840
is essentially

2975
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:20,960
essentially um about the research

2976
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:23,599
potential we see

2977
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,840
in in network computing for improving

2978
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,239
and retrofitting security and privacy

2979
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,040
and

2980
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:30,718
we mainly want to raise awareness for

2981
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:32,639
what is possible within network

2982
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,199
computing in this field

2983
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:37,040
um and as i mentioned before we are

2984
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:38,879
already actively conducting research on

2985
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:42,080
some of the presented topics

2986
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:43,840
the first promising results however i'm

2987
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:45,679
really curious to hear about your

2988
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,480
opinions on this topic

2989
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:49,440
and especially if it's of any interest

2990
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,519
for this group

2991
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:53,119
and what perspectives you see for this

2992
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:58,639
draft

2993
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:58,639
so that's it um and yeah thank you

2994
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:05,280
thank you so much yes i think the topic

2995
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:07,440
is of interest is actually in our

2996
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:10,480
charter to look at security

2997
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:12,960
i would suggest that you

2998
01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:14,400
continue discussing this on the list

2999
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,000
which i think

3000
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,000
is the right place and i actually put it

3001
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:19,520
down the notes but thank you very much

3002
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,760
for highlighting

3003
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:23,280
uh the research projects or the research

3004
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,679
ideas related to this

3005
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:26,320
i think every presentation should have

3006
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:28,960
this

3007
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:29,840
so thank you very much so uh phillip you

3008
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,119
you can take

3009
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,400
maybe five six minutes work

3010
01:57:33,119 --> 01:57:39,199
we're going to be a few minutes

3011
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:43,360
overboard but i think it's fine

3012
01:57:39,199 --> 01:57:45,440
hello can if i come through or not

3013
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:48,320
or do i have to join the queue do i have

3014
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,320
to join the key do i

3015
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:56,880
yeah can you share my slides

3016
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,760
please um i'm not sure i have your

3017
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,360
slides

3018
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:03,760
um i think i had them but

3019
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:07,839
oh no actually i do have them okay let

3020
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:07,840
me go back sorry

3021
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:17,599
it's great okay they're coming through

3022
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:20,960
so i'll stop so

3023
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:22,960
um i'm philip earley um

3024
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:24,719
and thank you very much i'm just gonna

3025
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,840
tell you very briefly about a

3026
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,679
collaborative project

3027
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:29,280
um called piccolo that we just started

3028
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:34,560
about in network compute

3029
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:37,759
5g services um next slide uh

3030
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,639
would be nice um so we've only been

3031
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,760
going a month

3032
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:43,280
um so these are just some first initial

3033
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,800
ideas about what we're going to do

3034
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:46,639
and about the use cases that we're

3035
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,920
looking at

3036
01:58:46,639 --> 01:58:51,119
we've got uh listed some of the people

3037
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,360
involved there

3038
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:54,239
um so some of them are well known to

3039
01:58:53,360 --> 01:58:57,280
this group

3040
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:58,799
um so i think uh we're very

3041
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:00,639
you know i'm very pleased with the with

3042
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,560
the set of partners and the people we've

3043
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:03,760
got involved and we've got some nice use

3044
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,679
cases coming

3045
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,840
uh and we're certainly intending to to

3046
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:09,760
contribute in coin and we're keen to

3047
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:13,119
you know to collaborate through forest

3048
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:13,119
such as such as coin

3049
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:19,440
i think we can go on the next slide

3050
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:19,440
thank you

3051
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:24,639
uh so yes i say it's about in network

3052
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,920
compute for 5g services so we'll slide

3053
01:59:24,639 --> 01:59:27,520
very quickly to

3054
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,440
tell you a bit about the in-network

3055
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:32,560
compute side of it

3056
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:34,719
and this was short time i'll just say

3057
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:36,560
talk a little bit about our initial

3058
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:37,440
thoughts about the initial directions

3059
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:40,880
that we're going to

3060
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:41,598
going to take on the project so we're

3061
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:45,679
interested

3062
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:48,480
in looking at joint optimization across

3063
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:50,800
networking compute and storage so making

3064
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,718
the assumption that all the

3065
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:54,960
all the nodes in the network have

3066
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:56,639
compute and storage capability

3067
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:59,280
in addition to networking and how you

3068
01:59:56,639 --> 02:00:01,599
can jointly optimize across them

3069
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:02,320
so kind of multi-objective optimization

3070
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,400
but

3071
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:07,920
making sure that's done in a way that's

3072
02:00:04,400 --> 02:00:07,920
uh tractable and scalable

3073
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:12,320
we're interested in looking at the

3074
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:14,880
distributed computing aspects so

3075
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:17,360
you know looking at um kind of pi

3076
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,599
calculus so how you

3077
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:21,440
distribute functions across in chains

3078
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:25,920
and meshes rather than the

3079
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:26,799
current lambdas lambda way of doing it

3080
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:29,280
um

3081
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,520
we're interested in looking at uh

3082
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:34,480
resilience and scaling

3083
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:36,239
so you know today we that the approach

3084
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:39,598
is to make the infrastructure

3085
02:00:36,239 --> 02:00:41,440
reliable and that quality of service

3086
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,040
into the infrastructure which is kind of

3087
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:46,400
what things like

3088
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:47,679
mech do so we we're interested in

3089
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:50,480
looking at

3090
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:52,280
scalability and reliability through

3091
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:54,239
instantiating functions and

3092
02:00:52,280 --> 02:00:56,639
reinstantiating functions

3093
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:57,759
rather than making the underlying system

3094
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:00,960
highly

3095
02:00:57,760 --> 02:01:03,199
redundant and scalable so um

3096
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:04,880
you know we had a bit discussion uh in

3097
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:08,400
the chat and the previous

3098
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:10,159
one of those previous talks um so that

3099
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:14,000
you know that's about state

3100
02:01:10,159 --> 02:01:16,320
uh not being held inside functions

3101
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,119
beyond there beyond some short life but

3102
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,559
put into

3103
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:23,119
put in storage um and i think that

3104
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:25,199
you know kind of overall our grand

3105
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:28,799
vision is that the networking

3106
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:31,759
you know in in you know

3107
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:34,080
it's it's the network will provide

3108
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:36,800
transparent in-network computing in

3109
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:38,080
in this similar way that provides

3110
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,800
transparent

3111
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:41,360
uh packet transport today and that being

3112
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,920
a

3113
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:44,639
fresh dimension for commissioners

3114
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:49,199
innovation

3115
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:50,800
and growth so that's kind of the overall

3116
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:53,360
approach that at least we're starting to

3117
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:56,159
take now if we go on the next side

3118
02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:57,119
so i've got um we'll you know we've got

3119
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:59,519
some

3120
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:00,400
uh use cases services that we're looking

3121
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,840
at

3122
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:04,159
so at the moment there's four in

3123
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:06,480
particular that partners are

3124
02:02:04,159 --> 02:02:07,280
interested in looking at i've got a

3125
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,199
slide on

3126
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:11,199
coming up on the vision processing and

3127
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:13,440
on the automotive side

3128
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:16,239
we've also got partners interested in

3129
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:20,000
the smart street lights

3130
02:02:16,239 --> 02:02:23,440
as a scenario and we meaning they're

3131
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,760
uh bt who i work for um we're interested

3132
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:27,199
in

3133
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:28,960
in this not only is a platform

3134
02:02:27,199 --> 02:02:30,638
um you know this kind of in network

3135
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:34,719
compute but also

3136
02:02:30,639 --> 02:02:37,599
using the technology to do autonomic and

3137
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,159
scalable network management um anyway

3138
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:39,920
i've got

3139
02:02:38,159 --> 02:02:41,598
so if we go on the next slide which is

3140
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:43,280
about uh the

3141
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,880
vision processing use case we're looking

3142
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:48,480
at so we've got

3143
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:50,159
um a uk sme called sensing feelings so

3144
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,040
they have a product at the moment which

3145
02:02:50,159 --> 02:02:54,879
is

3146
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:56,719
a camera which has in the camera or next

3147
02:02:54,880 --> 02:03:00,080
to the camera chip that does

3148
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:03,360
visual processing so they

3149
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:05,119
have uh they have their customers uh

3150
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:07,040
or what they do is provide to their

3151
02:03:05,119 --> 02:03:08,880
customers insight into people in real

3152
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,880
world spaces so that would be things

3153
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,280
like in a train station

3154
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,639
how do people flow around the train

3155
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,679
station

3156
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:19,360
or in a shop where do people spend most

3157
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:22,480
time which department

3158
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:24,000
or at a conference are people interested

3159
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,080
in what the speaker's saying

3160
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:29,760
are they excited or they just doing

3161
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:32,639
their email or they're falling asleep

3162
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,360
so what we're looking at in terms of

3163
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:37,360
piccolo

3164
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:39,280
is in in the camera having just a simple

3165
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:41,040
uh image conveyor and doing the visual

3166
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:44,239
processing in the operator

3167
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:47,679
fog in the edge uh that enabling

3168
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:49,839
them to get into uh

3169
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:52,400
you know kind of long-tailed because the

3170
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,719
the sensor would be much cheaper device

3171
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:56,480
or maybe to you know if you've got lots

3172
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:59,679
of cameras in the train station

3173
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:02,559
one human trying to look at 100 cameras

3174
02:03:59,679 --> 02:04:03,760
instead doing automatic uh automated

3175
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:05,119
attention focusing

3176
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,199
you know which picture has the most

3177
02:04:05,119 --> 02:04:10,400
interesting thing happening

3178
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:12,799
um so that's that's a

3179
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:14,559
vision processing use case and the first

3180
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:16,239
kind of example we're looking at we go

3181
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:20,960
on the next side

3182
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:24,079
um so we've got uh

3183
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:26,960
bosch in particular who have uh

3184
02:04:24,079 --> 02:04:27,759
interested in the automotive use cases

3185
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,400
60

3186
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,079
of their revenue comes from from

3187
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:35,280
automotive stuff

3188
02:04:32,079 --> 02:04:36,480
um so first use case we're particularly

3189
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:38,639
interested in there is

3190
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:40,959
infrastructure assisted driving so this

3191
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:44,000
is electronic horizon all kind of

3192
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:44,800
seeing around the corners um so at the

3193
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:48,719
moment there's a

3194
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:50,560
the product is is used for um

3195
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,159
driver assistance so this would be

3196
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:53,920
things like uh

3197
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:56,000
suggesting you slow down a bit and hit

3198
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:57,679
the green lights

3199
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,760
and at the moment the approach is you've

3200
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:02,079
got these roadside sensors that send

3201
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:04,000
their information to a central cloud

3202
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:06,000
and that then pushes the information to

3203
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,239
the cars

3204
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,040
so the approach we're looking at is to

3205
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:12,079
have uh

3206
02:05:09,040 --> 02:05:14,800
edge cloud so the information goes into

3207
02:05:12,079 --> 02:05:16,159
an edge edge clouds which would do kind

3208
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:18,560
of localized

3209
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:20,079
collation analysis and distribution of

3210
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:22,639
the information

3211
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:24,480
that would enable um you know kind of

3212
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:25,360
things to be done more efficiently and

3213
02:05:24,480 --> 02:05:28,638
to be done

3214
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:30,000
faster and therefore as it's done faster

3215
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:32,800
could be more suitable for

3216
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,639
automated driving you know maybe to

3217
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:36,880
drive faster even in

3218
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:38,000
more dangerous or car to be go faster

3219
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,360
even in more dangerous

3220
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,880
conditions such as a fog um so i think

3221
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:45,119
given the time that's that's

3222
02:05:42,880 --> 02:05:47,119
all i'll say and just say that um you

3223
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:50,719
know alert you that we've got this coin

3224
02:05:47,119 --> 02:05:52,719
related research activity and we've got

3225
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:54,560
some use cases we think are interesting

3226
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:57,119
and some early thoughts on our

3227
02:05:54,560 --> 02:06:02,480
approaches and we're highly motivated to

3228
02:05:57,119 --> 02:06:04,639
you know to contribute here

3229
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:06,559
that's it that's all that i think given

3230
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:09,440
the time that will do

3231
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,800
yes we're going to be uh very

3232
02:06:09,440 --> 02:06:13,440
interesting to see

3233
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,880
uh i think the whole group what do i say

3234
02:06:13,440 --> 02:06:16,960
i say we are going

3235
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,320
i i sound so regal suddenly maybe it's

3236
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:21,040
the british thing

3237
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:22,079
um you know it's the the queen here is

3238
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:25,280
very popular

3239
02:06:22,079 --> 02:06:25,759
um the um not the queen of england the

3240
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,679
queen

3241
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:29,679
at the queen the show actually the queen

3242
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:32,320
of england is not popular here

3243
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:32,320
but uh

3244
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:38,000
yeah we're we're back here i guess the

3245
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:41,280
only people who understand us live and

3246
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:44,560
uh live in scotland uh and the

3247
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:47,840
uh but yes we're going to be very uh

3248
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:48,239
interested in seeing uh which this comes

3249
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:50,960
through

3250
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:52,718
especially it is research and a lot of

3251
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,199
the contributors of this group

3252
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:56,960
are contributors to your project so it's

3253
02:06:55,199 --> 02:07:00,719
going to be really cool

3254
02:06:56,960 --> 02:07:03,440
uh we're six minutes over time

3255
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:04,560
so uh yes uh we're going to push our

3256
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:07,919
discussion

3257
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,920
uh of uh

3258
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:11,280
other work or future work of future

3259
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:14,959
collaborations

3260
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:15,920
to a february interim that we're going

3261
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:19,679
to

3262
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:22,880
organize and uh essentially

3263
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:25,440
tell everybody about very soon i would

3264
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,159
encourage people to use the list better

3265
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:29,280
we've had but i know right now what was

3266
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:32,400
happening everywhere

3267
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:34,239
it's so uh so weird nobody has time to

3268
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:37,360
do anything frankly

3269
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:40,879
um and uh so our schedules are

3270
