1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
okay

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,679
okay thank you all right

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,160
so then the only slides that we have to

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,480
share are the

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,000
the chair slides um

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,359
all right well it's on time

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,039
uh let us i want to start well let me

8
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,560
i'll start with sharing the slides once

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
once i see the slides

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,320
i can't see the meat echo thing so i'm

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,440
going to start

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,920
with a poll we have about

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:43,199
36 yeah we have 35 people

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
participants um and so you'll notice

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,480
just

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,559
below the in the upper left-hand corner

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
there's a show of hands

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,839
um and so i'm going to just take a straw

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,399
poll

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,680
um and it's

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,439
it's um

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
and so the question is we want to know

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,798
is are you familiar with the ietf

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,439
process the way it works

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,080
um if you are raise your hand if you're

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,758
not

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,880
don't respond or do not raise your hand

28
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
and depending on the number of you know

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
no votes

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
we get that'll indicate how much as

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,119
we're going through

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,798
this meeting i should explain

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:34,640
uh you know how we do things

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,960
and what it is um

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,079
so uh emnot and other people said 50

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,839
and so far it's currently uh running

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,119
about that we'll wait another 10 seconds

38
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
and see

39
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,159
which means to me that as we talk about

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
the things

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,880
um use the raise your hand tool

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,559
while i'm explaining something if

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,240
something's not clear we don't want to

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,360
turn this all into a you know process

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
discussion we want to be able to get

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,040
into the technical

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,520
merits but i think it's important that

48
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,759
people

49
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
know how to participate in the ietf in

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,960
an ietf working group

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,119
if they haven't already haven't already

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
learned because

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,840
outside of the work that's happening

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,760
here there'll also be a lot of stuff on

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
mailing lists and perhaps github and so

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,000
on

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,120
all right so there's the the vote people

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,920
can see

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
well two-thirds are familiar so i'll do

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
you know abbreviated intros and feel

61
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,959
free to mention something

62
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,440
um you can't do it in the chat because i

63
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,280
won't

64
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
see it easily but offline

65
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,200

you know start talking so with that

68
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,319
um i'll share my screen

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,839
and let us

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
do the chair slides

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,760
so welcome to the first meeting of the

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,959
http api working group working groups

73
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,399
where stuff gets

74
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,319
most of the ietf work product gets done

75
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
it gets done in face-to-face meetings

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,560
like this which are generally for

77
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,000
catching up

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,920
and explaining what's happened since the

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
previous meetings since there hasn't

80
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
been a previous meeting

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
this will be a kickoff every working

82
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,679
group

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,280
in the itf is organized into an area

84
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,319
each area is run by two

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,080
or more area directors basically barry

86
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,839
liba who you'll see in the participation

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,280
is our area director

88
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,280
um he is the person who we will turn to

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
who he is chairs will turn to if we have

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
you know process questions or something

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
like that

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,200
okay uh next page

93
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,959
the no well everything in the ietf

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,839
is done under a particular set of

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,640
intellectual property

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
um they're documented in what's called a

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,238
bcp

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
document a bcp is a number that doesn't

99
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
change even if you know it's a level of

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,959
indirection

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
right typical computer science solution

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
um

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,920
there are so there are a couple of bcps

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,000
that describe the standards process how

105
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,000
working groups work

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
we have anti-harassment and code of

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,720
conduct

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,479
uh processes you know don't be a jerk if

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
you are a jerk we will

110
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,520
there are options available to us um

111
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,040
there's dispute resolution and so on if

112
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
you disagree with what the chairs are

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
doing

114
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,639
you can speak to barry if you disagree

115
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
with what he's doing there's escalation

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,840
processes

117
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,960
the two um two of the important

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,239
intellectual property

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,120
processes are about copyright um

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,560
when you present a document for the

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
working group to adopt

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
which means the working group takes the

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,240
ownership of it that is

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,680
transferring the copyright of that

125
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,080
document to

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,400
the ietf patents and participation

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,440
if you participate in a working group

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
and that means

129
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,840
you know you say something pretty much

130
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
you agree that if you are aware of

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,080
patents

132
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,639
that affect the things that the working

133
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,479
group is working on

134
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
that you will inform the working group

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
or you'll phone the itf that you're

136
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
aware of patents

137
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
the idea being that you can't sit there

138
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
and help develop a standard and then the

139
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,919
patent gets

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
you know disclosed after things been

141
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,159
adopted and

142
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,600
and published um

143
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,680
the way we control that is through

144
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,520
what we use we use the term blue sheets

145
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
when we meet in face to face we hand

146
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
around blue

147
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
colored sheets of paper everybody signs

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
them and that shows who attended the

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
meetings

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,400
and it acknowledges that you agree

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,759
that you've read you understand and you

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,039
agree to abide by

153
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:05,280

the meeting is finished uh in the ietf

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,319
channel

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,159
shortly after depends of course on you

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,160
know time zone differences and so on

167
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
administrative tasks typically called

168
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
administrative administrivia

169
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
blue sheets happen as i said

170
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,400
automatically we need some volunteers

171
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,039
uh note takers that's being handled in

172
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
the

kodi md it's an ether pad you get the

174
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,719
pad we used to actually use etherpad now

175
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,679
we use codemd

176
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,440
um do i have anyone who will volunteer

177
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,319

178
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,039
we can't proceed past this step until we

179
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039

queue when you are relaying

212
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,680
people who aren't putting themselves in

213
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
the queue to speak

214
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
so is there someone willing to be a

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,640
it's been pretty

217
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,399
zero effort or close to zero i could i

218
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,919
can do that for you

219
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,240
okay and that was i think catch the

220
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
voice

221
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,600
who said who volunteered mark hi

getting off easy all right um

224
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
the agenda so we have the administrative

225
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
stuff

226
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,000
agenda bashing is where we look through

227
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320
the agenda and say other things we're

228
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,240
missing are the things we want to add

229
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,279
um i'm not expecting any major changes

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,560
uh but does anyone have any suggestions

231
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,680
as to what uh you know

232
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
any changes they want to make

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
uh unmute yourself and speak up now

234
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
um it might be good to have a little

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,519
discussion

236
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,200
about uh uh to set expectations about

237
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
how drafts get adopted in the working

238
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
group and what process we're going to go

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
through that

240
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,040
for that and how that could correct

241
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,160
yeah i was going to cover that in some

242
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
of the administration

243
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,480
i didn't put agenda items in for

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,160
discussing processes and so on because

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
it wasn't clear to me how much

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,920
we needed to do that but yeah that's a a

247
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
good point

248
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,800
um okay so uh

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
th this group is a little bit unusual in

250
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,720
that the charter doesn't contain

251
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,240
milestones of deliver this draft deliver

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,560
that draft deliver that draft it's like

253
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,120
the http working group where the group

254
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,719
you know goes and you know at least the

255
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
charter is set up so that the group goes

256
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
and decides what it adopts and checks

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
with the 80 and does it so

258
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,040
that might be a little unusual for some

259
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,399
folks sure

260
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,160
um okay actually i'm going to t

261
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
that all right before we'll get back to

262
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,079
that almost immediately

263
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,640
but are there any other agenda edition

264
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
suggestions

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,160
all right i'm going to give a two

266
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,920
sentence introduction about mark's

267
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,600
relevance to this working group and then

268
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,880
i'll let him

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,120
explain what the process is like

270
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
every working group has what's called a

271
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,839
charter

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,440
the charter describes what the group is

273
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,440
to work on it often

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,519
it can also describe what the working

275
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,399
group is not going to work on

276
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,040
and say this is out of scope charters

277
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
evolve

278
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,719
over the course of the lifetime of the

279
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,640
working group

280
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
and the way that's done

281
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
is the working group says we want to

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,920
amend the charter to discuss

283
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,680
this new thing that we hadn't

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,319
anticipated before

285
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
um the working group agrees they want to

286
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
make that change and then that gets

287
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
approved by the area director

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
and the collection of area directors

289
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,519
known as the iesg

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,880
changes in charter are filtered out to

291
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,160
the whole ietf

292
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,680
through an ietf wide mailing list

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,319
named ietf ietf.org which anyone can

294
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,079
join

295
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,000
and then the charter is approved

296
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,199
typically in a charter

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,160
um there are things milestones attached

298
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
that says oh by

299
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,120
mid-2021 we will have

300
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
determined an initial set of

301
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,279
things to work on

302
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,160
by the end of 2021 we'll have first

303
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,000
drafts

304
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,279
and by the end of 202 by mid 2022

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
will have um sent

306
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
the first the documents up to the isd to

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,040
review

308
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
um milestones are aspirational and they

309
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,639
also evolve over time and they can be

310
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,800
changed by the chairs in

311
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,800
conjunction with their area directors

312
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
so mark you want to talk about some of

313
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,399
the things that make this a little

314
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
unique

315
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
both for the old time iatfors and how

316
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
they work for the newcomers here

317
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,279
sure so um when when we proposed

318
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,040
the charter for this group you know part

319
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,360
of the impetus was that

320
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,959
while we did drafts like what we're

321
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,959
talking about here once in a while in

322
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,359
the http working group

323
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,119
um it wasn't you know it was difficult

324
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
to balance the the different

325
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,600
communities there they're slightly

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,680
different communities and specialities

327
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
and we felt like it there might be some

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,519
some benefit to having it

329
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,079
separate distinguished community and

330
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,200
working group to talk about http apis

331
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,040
and try and

332
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,600
push the ball forward on that and and so

333
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,000
my hope is is that this group

334
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
is going to form a community i won't say

335
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the community but a community of people

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,040
who are working on specifications

337
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,079
that help you know uh htv apis become

338
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,279
more interoperable and

339
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,839
more functional for folks um and so uh

340
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,360
when we chartered it uh it was

341
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
deliberately chartered in

342
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,959
much different way the http working

343
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,479
group is where it's an open remit

344
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,239
you know the group can decide well we

345
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
think that this is a good

346
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
draft to work on and so we're going to

347
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,480
adopt it and you do a call for adoption

348
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,079
and uh uh then you work on it and

349
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,120
published as an rfc

350
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,920
um there there's you know that's a

351
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,199
fairly generous amount of leeway in the

352
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
ietf

353
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,000
uh many most working groups are

354
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,239
chartered with very specific

355
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,160
deliverables in a very specific scope

356
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
and so i think it's good for us to have

357
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
a discussion here about

358
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
you know how we will go about doing

359
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,079
those adoptions i mean

360
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,920
the formality we use in the http working

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,359
group is is that we kind of get a sense

362
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,800
of

363
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,959
that you know a draft is a potential uh

364
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,560
um candidate it's a candidate for an

365
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,599
option and we have some preliminary

366
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,119
discussions and then

367
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,480
if we uh uh think that it's a contender

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
we put out a more formal call for

369
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,959
adoption where people say whether or not

370
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,079
they support

371
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,760
uh the adoption of that draft and

372
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,079
often we do count pretty strongly the

373
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,600
the intent of implementers if we see

374
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,800
lots of implementers saying yes i will

375
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
implement that or i intend to put

376
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,760
resources into this

377
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,240
that's a really good sign uh and and

378
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,279
it's a it's a mechanism that we use to

379
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,880
uh avoid you know creating documents

380
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,360
that don't get used you know

381
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,360
there's this concept that i often refer

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,839
back to of hope-based standardization of

383
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
well

384
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
look if we standardize something it will

385
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,240
it'll become important or get a real rfc

386
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
number and

387
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,959
the world will opt in everything will be

388
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,160
good and that's just not how the real

389
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,160
world works

390
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
becoming a standard is is the you know

391
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
the end of a process whereby something

392
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,479
gets used widely

393
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
and then it needs to be built on top of

394
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,360
sweet we kind of even out the edges

395
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,160
um and and so i i think i'd like to see

396
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
some discussion of of a process where

397
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,959
we can make sure that we're actually

398
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,839
working on things that are important and

399
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
it'll actually

400
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,120
you know get implemented and move the

401
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
needling industry not just somebody's

402
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,079
hobby horse project

403
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,519
although you know sometimes you do say

404
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,560
okay let's take a punt and see if that

405
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,360
thing works out because if it doesn't

406
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,319
work out

407
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,600
it's not going to waste a lot of

408
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
resources it's not going to cause harm

409
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,399
but if it does work out it's really good

410
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
that's a judgment call

411
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,720
and the work so the working group needs

412
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,920
to talk through all those different

413
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
things and

414
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,079
i suspect we probably need to get some

415
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,759
some runs on the board first and get a

416
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,680
working cadence going

417
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,120
uh and so it's great that we have a set

418
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,839
of documents that people have already

419
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
brought to

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,959
for discussion so maybe we just need to

421
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
start working on those but in the back

422
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,638
of our heads i think we should be

423
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,880
thinking about

424
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,920
the next set of documents and and

425
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,519
processes to

426
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
to make sure we adopt the right ones and

427
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,360
get them and set them up for success

428
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,880
so you know in the hp working group

429
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,560
we've actually recently started using a

430
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
dedicated github repo

431
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,758
where we just use the issues list to

432
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
track the status of different documents

433
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,720
that we might adopt in the future

434
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
and that's something we might want to

435
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
consider here because what's nice about

436
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,719
that is you don't have to refer back to

437
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,079
an email

438
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,759
three months ago and figure out what the

439
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,758
current state of something is the state

440
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
lives in that github repo that everybody

441
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,040
can

442
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,399
see um and and and

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,920
you know there are other things that i

444
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,199
think we could talk about in terms of

445
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,639
how to build a community here how to

446
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,839
make sure that this is

447
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,839
including a good selection of the

448
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,519
industry but but

449
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
it's early days so maybe maybe we should

450
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
just talk about the giraffes now

451
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
is that kind of what you're looking for

452
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,920
rich yeah that's exactly what i was

453
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,279
looking for

454
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,160
um thank you mark mark wrote the charter

455
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,959
for the group

456
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
and has i'm sure almost everybody here

457
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,199
knows mark

458
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
a long history has chaired created http

459
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,800
working group

460
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,120
uh had co-chaired the quick working

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
group for years and is

462
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,720
you know he's done a lot of work here

463
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,119
and he understands the process he's also

464
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
uh involved with lots of other processes

465
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,759
and he has been at the forefront of

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,440
pushing

467
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,959
um the iatf to

468
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
adopt you know these funky new

469
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,480
technologies like github

470
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,959
um i forgot to say one thing sorry

471
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,679
yeah charter has a built-in doomsday

472
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,720
clause

473
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,079
um that yes we need to prove ourselves

474
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,480
that we're a functional and

475
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,480
and productive group within an amount of

476
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,959
time and if we don't do that

477
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,760
uh we don't get renewed so i think

478
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
that's you know

479
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
that that's a good motivator until it

480
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,280
becomes a bad motivator but you know

481
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,520
right yes um uh can i

482
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,760
begin yeah please oh yeah barry barry

483
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,360
our area director please speak up barry

484
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,120
yeah hi this is barry lee but i wanted

485
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,719
to add one thing to what mark said about

486
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,959
adopting documents

487
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,280
that for those that are not ietf

488
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,120
regulars in the ietf when we accept the

489
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,480
document it's a starting point for

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,399
development and uh that doesn't mean

491
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
that the contents of that document are

492
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,280
what will be in the standard it means

493
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,199
that those are what are

494
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,559
what the initial proposal to the working

495
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,799
group is

496
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,480
and often there are significant changes

497
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,440
the entire document may change

498
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,039
drastically

499
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,520
through the process of developing the

500
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,840
document i just wanted to make sure that

501
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,000
people understood that

502
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:14,000
yeah yeah that's a really good point

503
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,640
go sorry that reminds me of one other

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,840
thing which is

505
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,360
is that uh i think uh it's chartered in

506
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,720
if not it's in the process that

507
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,159
when we adopt the document we need to

508
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
check with barry as our area director to

509
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
make sure that

510
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,960
he's aware of what we're doing we can't

511
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,640
just go off and willingly adopt things

512
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,160
and i think it would benefit you know

513
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
putting my http

514
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,919
chair head on i think would benefit us

515
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,760
and then the http work community

516
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,919
if there's a good level of coordination

517
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,400
uh on draft adoption between

518
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,760
http and http api to make sure that

519
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,640
there's awareness in both communities of

520
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,640
what the other two are

521
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,000
the other ones are doing um but i'm

522
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,120
pretty sure we can do that at a chair

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,919
level because

524
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
we we know each other so you know tommy

525
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,160
uh daryl if you don't know tommy i'm

526
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,678
sure you'll you'll get to know pretty

527
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
soon

528
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,120
yeah um and i would i'll maybe i'll send

529
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,720
a mail to the list uh we've just updated

530
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,239
our contributing document

531
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,240
in the http working group which talks

532
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,880
about things like draft adoption now

533
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,559
um and and i might send a message to a

534
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,039
list to see what people think about that

535
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
as a starting point you know i'm not

536
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,679
saying that

537
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,320
we should adopt a wholesale but it's

538
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,840
some text that we might find useful

539
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,600
yeah please do that i'll put that in

540
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,039
jabber and send us a list

541
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,399
okay great um okay

542
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,679
uh any questions about what we've gone

543
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,160
through

544
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,160
so far just speak up

545
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,559
great okay uh one of the first things we

546
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
should decide

547
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,879
yeah please go ahead i'm sorry excuse me

548
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,320
excuse me

549
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,440
uh can you please repeat the timeline

550
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,799
uh you suggested

551
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,080
at the beginning

552
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,639
uh you mean how long the the timeline

553
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,918
for the agenda

554
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:04,840
no the timeline for uh the world oh

555
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
that was just oh you mean like the

556
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,480
milestones yep

557
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
i was just making those dates up in my

558
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
head as i spoke

559
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,639
but the milestones are typically

560
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,480
measured

561
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,200
in units of months

562
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,039
and they are let's say they're

563
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,240
aspirational they always get

564
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,240
revised and pushed out

565
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:35,840
um it always takes longer than you think

566
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,840
even if something is drop dead simple

567
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,799
so uh yeah i yeah don't don't

568
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,760
you know a month or two to adopt some

569
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,840
documents six months to revise it

570
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,520
that's incredibly optimistic

571
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
but it's often what goes in in the first

572
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,480
draft and the area director

573
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
will be the one nagging the chairs to

574
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,520
come you know update and

575
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,720
fill in milestones and the chairs will

576
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,080
then come to the working group and say

577
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,400
okay how much longer do we need to do

578
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,639
this

579
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,919
our job as chairs is to keep the process

580
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,360
flowing

581
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,240
um i'm here

582
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,439
because i know how the ietf works daryl

583
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,559
is here because

584
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,200
he knows how http apis work

585
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,080
and so between the two of us we should

586
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
be able to

587
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,879
you know keep the working group flowing

588
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,880
smoothly

589
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,600
and if not then barry or his successor

590
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,080
as area director can

591
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,080
replace us but don't worry about that

592
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,240
um oh one other last thing to lead into

593
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840
because i'm gonna you'll hear the phrase

594
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,559
um everything

595
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
the the of well take it back it depends

596
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,320
on github

597
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,840
we have um many of the working groups

598
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:00,320
have tools to use github um

599
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,158
it seems like you know we should be like

600
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
a no-brainer and use it there is a

601
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,679
github

602
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,520
in my introductory note i pointed to a

603
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,880
document that described different

604
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,879
models of how to use github

605
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,919
i think i'd like to let me just say

606
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,879
does anyone object to using github as

607
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
the

608
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
primary source of where the working

609
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,440
group stores

610
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
uh its issues documents and so on before

611
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
posting

612
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,039
the official updates to the itf site

613
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,520
is there anyone who has concerns about

614
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,520
using it

615
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,720
okay i want to make sure i leave enough

616
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,880
time

617
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,559
great what we'll do is with mark's

618
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,039
help the chairs will set up uh

619
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,399
a github structure that has been used

620
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,520
successfully

621
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,080
i encourage people to look at the

622
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,000
get working group document and see if

623
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,840
they have questions or concerns and post

624
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,640
them to the http

625
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,639
api list

626
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,480
but it has proven to be you know fairly

627
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
smooth

628
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,520
as mark said one of the things we want

629
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,879
to do is we want this to be

630
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,760
a major community for working

631
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,159
on these areas and clearly um if you're

632
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,240
doing

633
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,520
http apis and you're not on github then

634
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,880
you are a niche player

635
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,039
so we clearly want to be on github

636
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,679
i'll end with the phrase we'll confirm

637
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,000
that on the mailing list

638
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,679
depending on how much we decide to adopt

639
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,600
github everything gets officially

640
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,039
confirmed by posting a thing to the

641
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
mailing list and say does anybody agree

642
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,000
with this decision that we made

643
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,039
um speak up let's confirm the consensus

644
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,720
and then we'll just

645
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,559
go ahead so our plan is to use github um

646
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,960
tim i'm sorry mark and i

647
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,000
and and daryl will will set up a

648
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,559
proposed

649
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,760
structure uh post someone will post a

650
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,158
note into

651
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,480
the um to the mailing list about how to

652
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,480
do it

653
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:13,520
okay the fun part of the agenda is then

654
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,039
considering you know dress to consider

655
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,600
adopting

656
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,760
we'll get into those right after this

657
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,959
milestones milestones look like this

658
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,960
we'll have to figure some out

659
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,799
github use we have an organization itf

660
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,799
working group http

661
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,039
repository for document one repo for

662
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,440
meeting materials i like mark's idea of

663
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,960
one

664
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
repo for future work there's a set of

665
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,679
tools all of this is documented

666
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:48,240
in you know the common uh

667
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,919
the git tooling the git rfc

668
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,000
martin has a set of scripts that use

669
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,600
github actions to

670
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
format the documents check that the

671
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,320
formatting works publish them up to the

672
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,080
data tracker the ietf's workflow site

673
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,080
there's common labels people are used to

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,559
seeing editorial resolved

675
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,279
to be fixed you know open issue and so

676
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,320
on

677
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,240
um not surprisingly the quick working

678
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,639
group and the hdb working group have had

679
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,880
extensive involvement with martin and

680
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,520
mark and there is very successful ways

681
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,520
of using them

682
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,120
so having gotten all the administrivia

683
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,158
out of the way

684
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,199
uh any questions or comments

685
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,360
or things people want to say i'll stop

686
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,480
sharing so i can

687
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:42,559
uh i do have a process question

688
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,640
um for those of us actually coming from

689
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,520
the itf the mere existence

690
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,400
of the working group especially with the

691
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,200
doomsday

692
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:56,400
uh um condition in its charter

693
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,000
is is a strong incentive to

694
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,480
generate standards and the kind of

695
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,159
mistakes we can do in

696
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,559
ipsec may for example if we create

697
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,600
a few useless apis it's a small industry

698
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,879
that

699
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,320
gets the damage if we create a bunch of

700
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,159
useless

701
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,279
http api standards it's

702
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,400
much bigger damage so my question is do

703
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,039
we have

704
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,360
any additional processes in mind

705
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,879
to ensure that there is actually what

706
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,360
concerns us

707
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,840
uh before we adopt or before we

708
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,840
standardize things

709
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,320
that's a really good question i'll defer

710
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,760
to uh

711
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,760
barry for commenting on that

712
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,000
or mark very handy

713
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,960
tab yaran can you just repeat uh

714
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,399
the last bit of your question so my

715
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,960
question is

716
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,640
we have a strong incentive to actually

717
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,919
generate standards

718
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,760
and since the industry in this case is

719
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:19,840
so big uh uh diverse but

720
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,440
just big uh we we have a large potential

721
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,639
of doing damage

722
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,480
so my question is do we have

723
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:32,840
a special processes in this group

724
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,320
to ensure that we actually do have wide

725
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,199
consensus

726
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,200
well i think the

727
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,760
it's in any working group

728
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,918
the the point is for the to have the

729
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,440
right participants in the room to decide

730
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,760
what's important to work on

731
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,279
what isn't what's useful and what isn't

732
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,960
and it's up to the working group chairs

733
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
to decide whether we have a critical

734
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
mass

735
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
of interest and implementation interest

736
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
in

737
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,120
implementation of what we produce

738
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,158
to proceed with it um so that's that's

739
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,639
what i'm expecting

740
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,080
and um that's what i'll consider and

741
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,960
discuss with the working group here is

742
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,879
when they say

743
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
there's a document that somebody wants

744
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,520
uh uh

745
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,840
put forward mark uh feel free to add to

746
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
that

747
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,679
i'd say that the the risk of doing

748
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,720
actual damage

749
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,279
is fairly small i think

750
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,200
unless you're considering damage to the

751
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,720
ietf's reputation which

752
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,240
frankly gets damaged in this fashion on

753
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,440
a nearly daily basis

754
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,480
um i personally i

755
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,919
that i think is it still drives a large

756
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
part of the challenge we face in that we

757
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,360
have a relatively short amount of time

758
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,880
to make sure that this community is

759
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,158
sufficiently representative of the

760
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
industry's needs

761
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,919
that we can actually do work that moves

762
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,279
the needle that actually

763
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,080
helps and doesn't get ignored uh

764
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,679
i personally will be objecting to

765
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,799
adopting documents that i don't think

766
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,440
can do that

767
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,840
uh that that don't seem to get traction

768
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,200
with

769
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,120
practitioners and implementers or at

770
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
least don't seem like they could

771
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,559
um and that'll just be my personal view

772
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
i would hope that a few other people

773
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,678
do that too and we can try and drive

774
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,919
some quality here but

775
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,559
yeah thank you

776
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,279
okay we're gonna the phrase is cut the

777
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,000
line

778
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,679
usually we um to stop this discussion

779
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
here we can have further discussion on

780
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,039
the mailing list

781
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,799
we've already burned through almost half

782
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,080
of our meeting time

783
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,080
and i know people are really more

784
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,559
interested in

785
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,559
the documents so uh

786
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,520
thanks all for putting up with all this

787
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,559
beginning

788
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,600
roberto you want to ask to share and

789
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,039
let's try to you know present the

790
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,240
general topic

791
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,559
and we have half an hour for five

792
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,679
documents so that means you have like

793
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,879
four or five minutes

794
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,880
to talk about each one

795
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
all right let's see if i can re join the

796
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,200
screen queue

797
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,520
yeah uh no i should have oh

798
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,520
okay

799
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,600
okay okay thank you thank you roberto

800
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,559
okay nice to meet you we are speaking

801
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
about great limit headers

802
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:34,158
the draft was written by me i worked

803
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,520
for the italian italian government

804
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:42,240
and from alex martinez from red hat

805
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,879
it's about communicating some service

806
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,159
status and standardizing headers

807
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,320
so we introduce red limit fields

808
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,320
the goal is to communicate service

809
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,320
limits so clients can stop

810
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,879
before flooding servers and the goal was

811
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,840
to align already existing red limit

812
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
hazards

813
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
and stop headers proliferation in my

814
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,720
experience between

815
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,760
roughly 20 000 api implementers in italy

816
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,880
i found at least 30 possible

817
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,440
rate limit header values and we

818
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
it doesn't work clients just ignore them

819
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,120
because they

820
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,240
don't know which header are

821
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,479
returned nor their semantic and another

822
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,559
goal was to express multiple rate limit

823
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,039
policies

824
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:36,320
so once them well eric

825
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,679
launched mark launched the pool and

826
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,879
it was positive now the specs

827
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,120
have roughly one year uh they are

828
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,480
configurable in redacry scale

829
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,320
kong and by proxy azure api gateway

830
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,000
they are supported by italy and the

831
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,120
netherlands um

832
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,320
more other countries european countries

833
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,479
which i'm in

834
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,320
touch with uh are going to implement

835
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,440
this just like a

836
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,918
the uk and some apis

837
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,480
so those are so much some of the headers

838
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,279
uh

839
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,840
we had to want to replace and on the

840
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,760
right

841
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,879
the simple set of um

842
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,399
values so just express the

843
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,240
the the squad units for the total limit

844
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:27,120
the number of remaining units you have

845
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,440
and then the reset time of the quarter

846
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,000
in delta seconds just like

847
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
retry after so we have the same semantic

848
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,559
for both

849
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,679
uh when you are in four to nine and uh

850
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,678
when you are with limiting

851
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,120
so uh in this slide seems complex but

852
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,840
just ignore the part the optional part

853
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,959
on the left

854
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,439
it's actually a comment

855
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,640
you just have to process the mandatory

856
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,080
part

857
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,320
but if you want you can express

858
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
all other multiple rate limiting

859
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,480
policies

860
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,960
with uh the number of seconds at the

861
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,399
number of

862
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,440
a quarter units and the

863
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,719
um window uh

864
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,159
so in this case we have

865
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,279
10 calls every five seconds

866
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,720
and i have one

867
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,919
cap of 80

868
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,240
requests in 60 seconds all

869
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,519
the this optional part should not be

870
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,200
interpreted

871
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,480
by the the client it's just

872
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,200
to communicate a wider

873
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,799
context of the rate limit so it's

874
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
optional

875
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,600
so technical choices we just support

876
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,399
delta seconds just like we try after

877
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,959
this

878
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,678
prevents issues with ntp skew and

879
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,120
adjustment

880
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,399
issues um moreover

881
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,199
when you use timestamp you need a

882
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,399
synchronization between clients and

883
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,600
server

884
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,239
the quota is expressed in units it may

885
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,239
or may not be requests

886
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:14,399
we want to standardize the

887
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:17,918
the syntax and we want to give

888
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:22,000
implementers a bit of flexibility

889
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:24,078
in implementing their their quota

890
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,079
so you have flexible semantics to

891
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,159
express dynamic policies

892
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,839
uh sliding windows and concurrency

893
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,359
limits that depends on

894
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,520
which values you feel uh

895
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,040
the fields and we don't mention

896
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,239
infrastructure concepts

897
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,000
like connection because a service can be

898
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:47,759
built with a wider infrastructure

899
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,399
and it's thanks to the experience of

900
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,679
alex

901
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,918
that works uh with the red hat api

902
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
gateways and there's a lot of experience

903
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,720
in deploying larger

904
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,599
large architectures with um

905
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,000
large api architectures of an issue

906
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,960
needing

907
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,160
input well after one year we have some

908
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,680
implementers

909
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,160
uh so uh well we can try and

910
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,399
change everything but i think we should

911
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,759
find a way to

912
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,960
respect the actual ecosystem that

913
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,079
that exists actually uh so

914
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,030
we can move but we should move with a

915
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,960
bit of uh

916
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,920
[Music]

917
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,400
sensible a bit sensibly so refined

918
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,119
normative language

919
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,760
respect to intermediaries use of

920
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,320
structured headers

921
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,359
whether we want to or not to define a

922
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
torturing scope

923
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,520
there was a discussion even with the

924
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,000
mark and roy

925
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,960
uh other um issues that may not be worth

926
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
investigating define header dependencies

927
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,200
and

928
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,920
upper bound upper bound for red limit

929
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,759
reset but what

930
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,880
we don't those are minor points

931
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,480
so one question everybody asks us

932
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,079
are you inventing a new service

933
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,200
management model

934
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,400
no we just want to clean

935
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,439
things up for all the organization

936
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,560
that use them so we are not proposing

937
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,359
something new

938
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,400
we want to just to reorganize something

939
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,839
that exists

940
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,599
for organizations that already use them

941
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,640
this is an existing use case

942
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,200
we want to mix standardize it

943
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,560
and we are not advocating this is the

944
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,640
best way of

945
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,400
throttling right limiting connection

946
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,879
whatever

947
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,920
and why don't you use timestamps because

948
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,400
well i said before

949
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,040
time stamps require ntp on both sides

950
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,079
and that

951
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,520
ntp is hard in the real world and

952
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,520
what and we'll actually try after

953
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:59,040
so thanks uh that's all i hope

954
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,160
i i have been

955
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,640
clear and quick and

956
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,279
i really hope that this draft will be

957
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,960
adopted because currently one of the

958
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,200
limit to the implement

959
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,280
for the implementers is that okay it's

960
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,399
cool we would like to implement that but

961
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,400
we are waiting uh for it to be

962
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
standardized

963
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,119
okay there was a comment in the chat

964
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,480
from mark

965
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,720
who's in favor of adoption but

966
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,800
understand you know proponents that the

967
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,078
draft may change in ways that will

968
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
break stuff that's already you know

969
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,119
could change in ways that will break

970
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,000
deployment

971
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,560
um if you know since you're seeking that

972
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,520
i

973
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,560
uh well i'm in the process of other

974
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,000
drafts so

975
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,560
i know it can change and um

976
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,440
i think we we can do whatever it's i

977
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
mean the

978
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:03,359
the work group is uh is master

979
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,760
okay uh all i say is that

980
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,520
i suggest doing that together with

981
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,839
implementers because it's

982
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,880
it's more sensible than just doing

983
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,279
something that

984
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,280
won't get adopted because people is

985
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,920
stuck with their previous implement

986
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,480
implementation unless they are clearly a

987
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,359
good very good reason

988
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:28,000
okay great um mark does anyone have it

989
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,960
thanks daryl does anyone have any

990
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,640
clarifying

991
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,079
questions that would make their

992
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,040
understanding of this more

993
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,599
you know improve their understanding

994
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,720
again

995
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,280
what we want to do is make sure we

996
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,399
understand the document so that we can

997
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,720
decide in the interest of time probably

998
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,240
most likely on the mailing list

999
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,240
should we adopt this as a work item

1000
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,560
we're not gonna there's lots of

1001
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,000
discussion in the in the chat about

1002
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,799
changes that could be made should be

1003
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,960
made um and as someone pointed out

1004
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,560
uh we'll make those after adoption but

1005
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,560
are there any any clarifying questions

1006
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,720
seeing that there seems to be a lot of

1007
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,759
positive interest in this

1008
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,000
is there anyone who can think who wishes

1009
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
to

1010
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,240
say now that they are opposed to

1011
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,240
adoption

1012
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:31,119
or they're not ready to decide yet

1013
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:43,280
uh suggested we do show of hands okay

1014
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:46,400
we'll do that since that work before

1015
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,880
raise your hand if you are opposed um or

1016
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,800
you're just

1017
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,000
not ready to decide we're not making the

1018
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,720
decision here again

1019
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,359
we'll go to the mailing list anyway so

1020
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,319
if you're opposed

1021
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,319
please let us know

1022
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,839
nobody's raising their hand many are not

1023
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,160
so it seems we have strong consensus

1024
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,160
here

1025
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,319
among those who have an opinion to adopt

1026
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,240
this we will

1027
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,240
take it to the mailing list and confirm

1028
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,720
that decision

1029
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,959
before it gets adopted we'll have set up

1030
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,399
the github repo and

1031
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,440
publish you know how to transfer the

1032
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,880
repo over and things like that

1033
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,880
so there's the results thank you

1034
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,560
okay we have thank you everybody i

1035

screen access sure

1048
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,640
okay so you have three drafts you're

1049
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
presenting

1050
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,040
we'll take a break after each one

1051
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,520
to see if there's any clarifying

1052
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,079
questions to do a poll about interest

1053
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,480
in the working okay

1054
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,000
and we have a total of 18 minutes so you

1055
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,000
get the same six minute quarter

1056
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,240
okay go for it thank you very much

1057
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,759
okay thanks very much so i'll be

1058
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,399
presenting three drafts

1059
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,960
uh for adoption and the http building

1060
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,240
blocks or http api building blocks uh

1061
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,319
working group

1062
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,279
very briefly about myself for those of

1063
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
you who don't know me

1064
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,040
my name is eric i've been working in

1065
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
companies that

1066
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:07,200
are selling api management software so

1067
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,520
my

1068
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,240
input mostly comes from companies who

1069
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,319
are

1070
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,560
developing apis and are looking for

1071
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,480
certain design patterns so to speak that

1072
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,040
they can use an apis to

1073
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,040
make it easier to scale their api

1074
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,839
plans

1075
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,839
i think we lost eric

1076
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,399
you click on the little circular arrows

1077
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,520
in the bottom right hand corner to

1078
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,520
reconnect your audio

1079
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,400
or reconnect completely this video from

1080
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,400
us as well

1081
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,610
i guess i can say windows probably

1082
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,279
decided to reboot

1083
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:14,160
[Music]

1084
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,480
what time zone is he in did it was it a

1085
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,879
a mandatory mac update just to get the

1086
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:27,839
other side involved

1087
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,839
what's the chance

1088
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,800
all right well 18 minutes was probably

1089
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:47,119
just too much for him

1090
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:51,200
nothing yeah okay

1091
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,200
um he didn't have a backup presenter

1092
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,760
so you're here you can't hear me

1093
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,439
uh we can now yeah oh

1094
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,280
i don't i'm sorry i don't know what

1095
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,640
happened um

1096
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,319
i'm really confused fact okay sorry to

1097

my apologies um

1098
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,640
okay so deprecate when when did it stop

1099
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,680
did you see the deprecation

1100
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,200
slide no can you reshare too

1101
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:22,560
no yeah oh my god i am so sorry

1102
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,598
um everything yeah my internet is not

1103
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,680
doing well um yeah it's

1104
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,280
it's stopped right at the what's called

1105
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,680
the tail end of your introductory slide

1106
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,680
about you

1107
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,160
very good so all the interesting stuff

1108
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,359
didn't

1109
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,359
work okay now

1110
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:47,680
okay now first draft api

1111
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:51,359
deprecation can you see that slide about

1112
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,640
that draft yes okay good

1113
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,560
thanks i'm nervous now so that one

1114
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,400
uh was developed together with sanjay

1115
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,480
delau the motivation was to have

1116
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,280
something that allows you to announce

1117
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,119
that an api is going to be deprecated or

1118
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,040
it has been deprecated

1119
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,960
in the same way as the sunset header

1120
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,359
allows you to say that an api is going

1121
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,440
to be

1122
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,520
shut down so the idea was that it would

1123
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,480
be the same simple mechanism

1124
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,000
that allows you to just have a timestamp

1125
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,680
and that time timestamp either

1126
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,480
is in the future or in the past and

1127
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,319
allows you to state the fact that an api

1128
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,480
is deprecated or will be deprecated

1129
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,880
the the model is really simple it's just

1130
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,000
a simple timestamp it's a simple http

1131
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,680
header field

1132
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,400
and the idea is that in apis

1133
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,520
that most likely will be something that

1134
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,960
maybe only the

1135
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,520
home resource will expose but

1136
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,520
like with a sunset header field that is

1137
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,359
actually up for the api

1138
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,960
designer to decide where this header

1139
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,240
field will be used

1140
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,760
and where api users can basically check

1141
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,959
for it and the draft also defines a

1142
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,960
deprecation

1143
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,040
link relation so that if you have

1144
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,760
additional information about

1145
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,599
deprecation what are alternatives when

1146
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,560
is the shutdown going to happen all of

1147
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,839
this you can link

1148
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,640
to additional resources and that's the

1149
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,440
fundamental model behind it the history

1150
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,400
this draft

1151
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,800
we started working on it in february

1152
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,800
2019

1153
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,160
we have published four versions in the

1154
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,200
meantime i've

1155
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,200
put all the links here all the slides

1156
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,399
are online you can find them

1157
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,359
and follow the links we have a section

1158
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,400
on implementation status meaning that

1159
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,119
there are

1160
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:39,280
some existing implementations already

1161
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,760
some use the deprecation header field

1162
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,839
others

1163
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,599
use something similar but they use a

1164
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,560
different concept because it's not yet

1165
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,200
standard

1166
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,400
but we do see some uptake at least in

1167
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,839
the field where

1168
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:55,680
api designers seem to think that this is

1169
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:58,960
something that's useful

1170
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,640
so i think that's it for

1171
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,440
the deprecation header field i really

1172
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,200
want to keep it short and sweet

1173
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,560
i just want to bring up one point i

1174
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,839
believe the deprecation

1175
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,480
draft has reference to

1176
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,880
sunset header and the deprecation is

1177
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,160
marked as on standards track but sunset

1178
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:25,119
is informational

1179
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:28,000
just doesn't matter is that a problem

1180
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,960
oh we lost him again that is not a

1181
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,960
problem thank you martin

1182
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,960
all right while waiting for eric to

1183
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:41,680
reconnect um

1184
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:45,200
i'm sure he's about to mark has a hand

1185
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,839
yeah okay oh there's eric he's back

1186
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,000
i have been asked about this draft from

1187
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:53,040
the api people in my employer

1188
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,440
and they expressed desire for it um i've

1189
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,960
also

1190
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,880
heard from sanjay one of the authors

1191
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,119
that he's talked to lots of folks about

1192
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,640
it

1193
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,559
so i i think there's definitely demand

1194
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,319
for this and i think there's

1195
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,000
a certain amount of urgency around it so

1196
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:07,839
i i support adoption

1197
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,640
yeah we we are already using it on the

1198
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,640
microsoft graph

1199
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:21,839
there you go okay um does anyone have

1200
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,839
concerns about it being adopted

1201
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,440
okay we will uh move forward with a call

1202
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,200
to adopt

1203
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,200
on the mailing us yes i see lots of

1204
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,240
support in the jabber chat

1205
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,200
uh okay we'll do it at this point it

1206
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,640
seems i think things are

1207
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,240
people are bringing stuff up that they

1208
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,920
already know is of interest

1209
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,520
so i first want to hear if there's

1210
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,000
people who have objections

1211
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,559
uh julian it's supposed to show our

1212
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,240
hands

1213
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,760
it's in the interest of savings time

1214
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,879
since we will be going back to the

1215
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,880
mailing list for all this stuff

1216
00:48:53,040 --> 00:49:00,640
all right eric next next draft

1217
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,160
okay extra the the next draft is a

1218
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,200
little bit more

1219
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,839
complex maybe so that is something

1220
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,118
that i've been working on with herbert

1221
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,720
from the sample

1222
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,880
so here the idea is that there is the

1223
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,720
web linking draft that has been around

1224
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,839
for a long time authored by

1225
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,959
mark updated in the meantime and

1226
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,520
it has basically defined how web links

1227
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
work

1228
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,800
it's something that is really

1229
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,920
fundamental to many things

1230
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,319
nowadays what it doesn't allow you to do

1231
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,000
is

1232
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:36,160
represent links themselves as a resource

1233
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,920
so we have had various scenarios where

1234
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,839
that would be interesting

1235
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,400
one of those scenarios for example is

1236
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:44,480
that you have a large number of links

1237
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,800
that are associated with resource and

1238
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,119
you cannot or don't want to

1239
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,839
put all of these into a header field so

1240
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,640
you want to

1241
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,160
serve the links as a separate resource

1242
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,240
that's one scenario

1243
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:00,240
another scenario that we looked at is

1244
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,720
that you might have a resource being

1245
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,839
served from one location and the links

1246
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,319
actually are served

1247
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,319
from a third party saying here are some

1248
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,640
links about that other resource

1249
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,520
again you would need a resource that can

1250
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,118
represent

1251
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,759
a bunch of links what we've done in that

1252
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,520
draft

1253
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,559
is we have taken the model defined by

1254
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,240
the web linking

1255
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,040
rfc we basically just define a media

1256
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,520
type for it

1257
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,800
and say okay here's a media type how you

1258
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,960
can use

1259
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,680
those links in a standalone resource

1260
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,280
and the majority of the draft then also

1261
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,480
defines a json

1262
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:43,440
model for the same underlying web

1263
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,599
linking model but it's a json syntax

1264
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,359
and that is because we believe that

1265
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,960
probably a lot of people would

1266
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,880
prefer having json and instead of having

1267
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,800
to parse the specific

1268
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,800
header syntax

1269
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:03,359
there are some tricky parts around

1270
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,920
the context so when do you use anchors

1271
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,680
and stuff

1272
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,280
and i don't want to go into any details

1273
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,480
around this but we've

1274
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,960
carefully worked these things out

1275
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,240
at least that's what we believe here is

1276
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,559
a very simple example

1277
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:21,359
so that would be a json version of

1278
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,240
of two links basically both links have

1279
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,960
an anchor

1280
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,919
link relation and a target and that's

1281
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,800
just a simple

1282
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,240
json representation for doing this kind

1283
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,079
of thing

1284
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,919
about the history this one actually we

1285
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,400
have started developing that a long time

1286
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,400
ago in december 2016

1287
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,079
we switched drafts in the in the middle

1288
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,920
somewhere but in the meantime we have

1289
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,880
actually we've gone up to 11 draft

1290
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,760
versions

1291
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,040
we tweaked the biggest change we did was

1292
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,319
actually tweaking the

1293
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,920
json model to be json ld friendly

1294
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,359
because we had some input from

1295
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,520
communities that were

1296
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,598
saying that it would be nice if the json

1297
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,520
would work well with json ld

1298
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,160
so we went through a whole redesign of

1299
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,359
json that's where we are now

1300
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,200
we do have some implementations

1301
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,480
so we have implementations in library

1302
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,439
systems we also

1303
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,319
probably have a very very big upcoming

1304
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,520
implementation

1305
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:16,400
and the gs1 standard they want to use

1306
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,079
the linkset

1307
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,839
model as well js1 are product codes

1308
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:24,079
so they have a lot of information about

1309
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,920
products same kind of thing you can

1310
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,640
represent that with links

1311
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:30,480
and they have asked us that they would

1312
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,879
really like this to become a

1313
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,640
standard better sooner than later we'll

1314
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,520
see how fast it goes

1315
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,240
but that's the current status that we

1316
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,480
have there

1317
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,479
that we do have some interested parties

1318
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,680
we have some implementations and we have

1319
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,839
a little bit of implementation

1320
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,839
experience as well

1321
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,119
we have a couple okay this is it yeah go

1322
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,119
for it daryl

1323
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,160
mark phil i'll just jump in if i may

1324
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,000
hello

1325
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:06,720
um phil archer um

1326
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,200
just to um back up what eric was just

1327
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,598
saying

1328
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,919
um gs1 for those who don't know is this

1329
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,200
body behind the barcode we have

1330
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,400
one and a half million members around

1331
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,839
the world including all the biggest

1332
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,319
retailers and manufacturers

1333
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,119
we very strongly endorse this we have a

1334
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,480
standard

1335
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:25,040
in uh public review at the moment

1336
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,800
um which has a big section that says the

1337
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,000
following text is normat is

1338
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:31,359
informative only be only until link set

1339
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,119
becomes a standard when all the text

1340
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,720
below becomes normative right we really

1341
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,440
really want this to be an rfc

1342
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,959
we've already implemented it um we have

1343
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,839
people like you know every healthcare

1344
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,680
company in the world

1345
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,240
asking for this so we are strongly

1346
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,240
endorsing it

1347
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,000
okay

1348
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,879
you should have heard what they were

1349
00:53:52,800 --> 00:54:00,240
saying about you while you were gone

1350
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,240
uh any questions clarifying comments

1351
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,879
alexis has a hand raised

1352
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,879
go for it carol

1353
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,800
i just had a quick look uh at rfc 6690

1354
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,920
that came out of the core working group

1355
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,599
and i believe it

1356
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,359
already describes one of the formats in

1357
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,280
the draft which is identical but the

1358
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,000
media type is already registered so

1359
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,680
i think checking that this is not

1360
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,440
duplicating existing work

1361
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:35,759
a good thing um the json one is

1362
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,760
i don't believe it's registered it makes

1363
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:41,440
sense if

1364
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,280
i yeah so the core model is close it's

1365
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,520
it is not the same model so they have

1366
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,960
tweaked the model for their needs uh we

1367
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,920
we looked at that when we started

1368
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,920
working uh

1369
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,920
on that and we decided that the core

1370
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,640
model was not what we needed because

1371
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,880
they didn't

1372
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,558
take the the real web linking model but

1373
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,280
instead they tweaked it in some ways

1374
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,960
that they

1375
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:02,559
needed can you elaborate

1376
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,559
is the format not the same that's what

1377
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,400
you're thinking

1378
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,040
the underlying model is not exactly the

1379
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,040
same actually

1380
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,000
the underlying model doesn't matter this

1381
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
is just another use of existing media

1382
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,520
type

1383
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,240
i think that's what i'm saying okay

1384
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,759
i don't understand i will um i will i

1385
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,399
will have to get back to you because

1386
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,920
that we

1387
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,760
we looked at that a long time ago i

1388
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,000
can't remember exactly what the

1389
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,240
differences were we did find differences

1390
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,440
that that made us develop a new

1391
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,598
one or made us write this graph

1392
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,640
but i can't give you the details right

1393
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,079
now

1394
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,000
all right yep so i mean if the syntax

1395
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,359
end up being different then that's fine

1396
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,480
i just you know if

1397
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:50,000
yeah just double check basically yeah we

1398
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,359
can continue this on the list and there

1399
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,480
is another

1400
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,000
draft from evert uh that is trying to do

1401
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,280
the same thing so there needs to be some

1402
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,880
reconciliation there

1403
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,839
but there's definitely a lot of interest

1404
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,839
in this particular

1405
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,839
capability

1406
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,839
okay eric i guess we will

1407
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,520
provisionally you know take it to the

1408
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:19,599
list that we are concerned about the

1409
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:21,920
reproduction and uh the duplication

1410
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,960
and the competing documents that we'll

1411
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,200
have to resolve that

1412
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,720
and figure out what we're going to do

1413
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,399
right sure is interested in

1414
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,598
thinking this work is valid so eric

1415
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:34,640
thank you please go on to your last one

1416
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,119
okay move on to the last one the last

1417
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,160
one

1418
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:41,200
is um called content warnings

1419
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,200
so this one is has been worked on in

1420
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,160
collaboration with andre

1421
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,359
silik and the motivation for this one

1422
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,078
was that when

1423
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:55,200
the rfc 7807 came out about

1424
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:58,160
problem details for http apis that was

1425
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,399
a that is a rfc that you can use to

1426
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,359
serve standardized error messages which

1427
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,680
is very useful

1428
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,680
it's it's used in many apis nowadays

1429
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,919
there was a clear need for that

1430
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,078
and then the question was can we do

1431
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,480
something about warnings meaning that

1432
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,280
there is not an error but some some

1433
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,079
condition

1434
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,119
was not exactly as it should be is there

1435
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,000
a way how this

1436
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,920
could be exposed in apis without having

1437
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,200
to reinvent that mechanism

1438
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:28,640
every single time and

1439
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,319
what we did is we came up with a model

1440
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,879
where there's a header field called

1441
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,839
content warning and that header field

1442
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,559
then

1443
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,920
signals that there that the request was

1444
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,599
successfully

1445
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:43,760
um process but that there

1446
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,359
has been that there have been some

1447
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,960
warning conditions

1448
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,960
and there are different ways how this

1449
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,520
can be signaled um the draft

1450
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,160
proposes that there will be a registry

1451
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,079
for

1452
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,520
registering different kind of content

1453
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,000
warnings the draft itself

1454
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,359
only registers one which is called

1455
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,640
embedded warning

1456
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:06,078
and it also proposes a json structure

1457
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:10,400
that apis then can use to actually

1458
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:13,200
embed the warning in the response

1459
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,680
this looks like this to show you a very

1460
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:19,439
brief example so there's a post

1461
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,000
and then the response says it's okay

1462
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,720
but there are embedded warnings and then

1463
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,200
in the

1464
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,959
content you see that there's this

1465
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,118
specific

1466
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,960
structure in here and this structure is

1467
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,880
what is proposed in the draft it's

1468
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,960
actually

1469
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,680
relatively similar to what rfc 7807

1470
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,640
standardizes for the error messages

1471
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:43,759
slightly different

1472
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,640
but to to give some similarities in the

1473
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,040
models how that works

1474
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,078
the history of this draft is we started

1475
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,319
working on it

1476
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:53,920
about a year about a year ago in

1477
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,920
november 2019

1478
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,960
it we have seen three draft versions so

1479
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,960
far

1480
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,280
we have worked on making sure that

1481
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,079
we see some implementations i think for

1482
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,319
this draft

1483
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,480
definitely implementation status still

1484
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,520
needs to be tracked better i'm not aware

1485
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,920
of that many

1486
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,280
implementations but we do see some

1487
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,480
uptake

1488
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,760
and that's the the last draft that i

1489
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,280
wanted to present

1490
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,200
and just to as a summary right again

1491
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,640
like i have a slide here where you can

1492
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:30,839
find all the information

1493
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:33,839
but that's all that i had to

1494
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,839
present

1495
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,118
any clarifying questions comments

1496
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:51,359
wasn't clear to me that uh

1497
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,040
we had as strong consensus for adoption

1498
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:58,078
here so

1499
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,079
um mark's got a hand yeah

1500
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,280
so we discussed this and and the

1501
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,240
precursors to it in the http working

1502
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,799
group

1503
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,479
and um there was the first stage was

1504
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,079
just reusing warning which we felt was a

1505
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,559
bad idea and then he did the content

1506
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,720
warning

1507
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,760
proposal but uh this is one of the

1508
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,959
things where i think having a separate

1509
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,319
working group is useful because that

1510
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,599
community didn't have a lot of interest

1511
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,680
but that doesn't mean

1512
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,880
it's necessarily a bad idea it just

1513
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,680
wasn't interesting to folks in that

1514
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,119

1515
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:26,799
um my only question about this is

1516
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,880
you know one of the considerations you'd

1517
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,119
make uh in this sort of thing

1518
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,880
when weight up the header is whether it

1519
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,160
uses structured headers

1520
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,920
and normally i think that's something we

1521
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,399
can talk out in the course of

1522
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,760
working on the draft but because this

1523
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,760
one is saying

1524
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,799
you know up front this is a json format

1525
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,559
in a header

1526
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,160
it's something oh it does use sf i

1527
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:47,839
thought it was jason

1528
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,319
martin says it instruction headers never

1529
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:52,640
mind okay cool

1530
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,720
and i it uses json is the embedded

1531
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,640
warning

1532
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,919
but the the header field itself is

1533
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,400
actually defined as

1534
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,119
using the structured headers oh i see

1535
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,200
okay

1536
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,920
um i i would i would support adoption in

1537
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,680
that i think

1538
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,040
that i can see the use cases for this

1539
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,160
that people want to service this

1540
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,440
information

1541
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,640
in headers where they don't have to

1542
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,160
crawl through the payload to find out

1543
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,759
what the errors were especially

1544
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,200
for use cases like logging if you want

1545
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,799
to do logging with your infrastructure

1546
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,118
like a cdn or

1547
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,799
or you know envoy or something it's a

1548
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,480
lot easier to log a header than it is to

1549
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,359
log something from the body

1550
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,680
and we do see uh some pressure on people

1551
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:31,040
to define new http status codes

1552
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,919
because it's you know they want

1553
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,040
something they can log so i i would

1554
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,680
i think that this would be an

1555
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,680
interesting thing to have and

1556
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,879
i don't see how it could be harmful if

1557
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,359
it doesn't get an option it's just

1558
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,200
another header that doesn't get used

1559
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:47,119
but i i think if i understand correctly

1560
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:49,759
that you wouldn't actually log what's in

1561
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:53,280
the header the header is just a signal

1562
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,559
to go look in the body to go and say oh

1563
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,599
there is a warning

1564
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:00,000
in this body and therefore you

1565
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:01,920
ignore all bodies that don't have a

1566
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,520
content warning header

1567
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,119
but then if there is a content warning

1568
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,319
then you go into the body to go looking

1569
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,760
for the warning

1570
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:11,680
am i right there yeah you could you

1571
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,200
could basically do statistics about you

1572
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,359
know how many warnings do we get

1573
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,598
like that kind of thing but in order to

1574
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:19,119
really retrieve the full warning

1575
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,960
information you would need to go into

1576
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,039
the body

1577
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,720
right but from what i saw in the example

1578
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,400
there was an identifier for the warning

1579
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,279
in the header which is what you'd grab

1580
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,119
on to

1581
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,640
um i mean you can say you can tell that

1582
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,160
there's a warning the body just from the

1583
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,279
the media type already

1584
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,799
if you just wanted to know whether or

1585
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,200
not there was a warning there there's a

1586
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,839
media type defined for problem details

1587
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:41,680
so you know you know because this is for

1588
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,599
a successful response

1589
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,839
this is where you aren't returning a

1590
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,640
failure you're returning a 200 but

1591
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:50,078
there's warnings in there

1592
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,200
okay i need to go back and read the

1593
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,200
draft again that sounds weird

1594
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:56,160
chris has a hand

1595
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,879
yeah that gets in and around one of the

1596
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,759
questions that i had had

1597
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,799
um so is the pictured usage of this

1598
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,839
exclusively

1599
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:11,759
for jason documents so like would it be

1600
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,359
possible to have

1601
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:15,200
it's not clear to me from reading at

1602
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:17,920
least but what we have now

1603
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,319
that the scope of this uh covers you

1604
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,240
know

1605
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:26,160
if someone's returning xml cbore

1606
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:28,799
mp5 whatever um

1607
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,759
that it would be you it would be usable

1608
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:33,119
to have this

1609
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,640
content warning um as part of that

1610
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,480
because there would be nowhere to

1611
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:40,558
necessarily to put

1612
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,559
um to put the warning

1613
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:47,839
is that correct i misreading it

1614
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,839
html yes

1615
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,038
i'm sorry i dropped out again i love my

1616
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,039
isp so

1617
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:04,160
uh i'll catch my question

1618
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,520
no i did not we'll have to take the

1619
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,960
discussion i think to the mailing list

1620
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,079
because we're already a little bit over

1621
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:11,039
time

1622
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,480
okay i think the scoping on this is

1623
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,400
going to affect the

1624
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,319
the desire for adoption yeah

1625
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,599
um so i would i would say that we need

1626
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,759
some more discussion and

1627
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:22,880
and scope it like chris was saying uh we

1628
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:26,160
won't explicitly

1629
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,520
call for an adoption yet um okay

1630
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:31,680
so i i think by all accounts we've had a

1631
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,119
very successful first meeting

1632
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,919
uh i'm going to end with thank you to

1633
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:38,480
