13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,439
recorded

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,520
if you are seeing this you're probably

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,000
in the right place we have a jabber room

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,000
which is mirrored to the um

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,680
jabba window uh

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,240
we have kodiamg page

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:41,840
for the note taking are there any

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,839
volunteers for note taking

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,839
i will be taking notes alexi all right

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,839
thank you

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,840
okay so um

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,839
working group status

25
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,560
we got charted we did a bit of work in

26
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,360
october

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,200
so i think um even though it was a bit

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,239
late it was a productive start to the

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,839
discussion

30
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,360
um there are a few things that

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,560
uh chairs are either late taking care of

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,720
or are still now to the list so

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,560
um we still haven't selected editor for

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,800
the core email applicability statement

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
draft we had two volunteers

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,840
we would like to have more than two

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,840
volunteers please

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
some of the people who volunteered we

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
don't know so would like to conduct

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
interviews

41
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,640
um please please please as a volunteer

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,080
or suggest somebody else who can

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,079
be a good person um

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:01,040
somebody new would be great but you know

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,359
i think we'll take everybody

46
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,760
um apologies for late agenda and slides

47
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
um

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,519
i was um waiting for feedback

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,560
from our editors and done slides

50
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,760
yesterday so

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,040
yes i agree this is very late and

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,239
i started discussion on the mailing list

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,239
but remember that

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
we're not going to close any issues

55
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
today

56
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
everything needs to be verified on the

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
mailing list anyway

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,518
so this is just how atf does things

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,560
there are no

60
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,560
new rules here so um

61
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,519
let's have a productive meeting and the

62
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
other thing is

63
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,799
um i know the timing of this

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,920
meeting is not great um but

65
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
however this is not much

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,839
we can control so

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:18,959
agenda so um

68
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:22,479
we're going to start with 53 22

69
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,000
and take as long as as we

70
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,000
we need um then if there is desire

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,759
and if we can get something productive

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,759
we'll get to 53 21 bits

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:43,840
any agenda bashing at this point

74
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
okay assuming none let's get started

75
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,840
so um three things we want to discuss

76
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
with 5322 today

77
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,960
the work one issue that came out of

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,680
uh actually smtp department about

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,680
trace header field definition that net

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
freed initiated

81
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
so we'll discuss this first and then

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,800
we'll discuss

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,639
possible solutions for a couple of rata

84
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:25,840
items

85
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:25,840
do i have let's see

86
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,880
ah there we go so now you can hear me

87
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
yes we can hear you excellent well at

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,800
least i can hear you

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,599
well that's probably close enough all

90
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,639
right

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,400
um let me

92
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,600
jump right in um i believe the

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,198
issue of a definition for trace headers

94
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,960
comes out of the discussion that was

95
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
going on

96
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
either on i forget whether it was going

97
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,360
on on email core or iatf

98
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,240
smtp um such that it was clear

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
what a trace header was and people

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:16,000
thought that this belonged in

101
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,719
53 22. um just by way of reminder and

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,720
this will

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,160
probably come up with other issues the

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,039
way 5322

105
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
was originally arranged um for any of

106
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,639
the given fields

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,800
there was a syntactic uh syntactic

108
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,840
description of what the field was

109
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,240
followed by the abnf followed by

110
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,758
the sort of a semantic description what

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,880
it you know what it meant what it was

112
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,479
used for

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,719
so this sounds like the kind of thing

114
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,520
that could go into

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
the semantic portion you know that that

116
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
second part

117
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
for trace fields and describe that of

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
course these can be extended with

119
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,680
optional fields

120
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
and um you know say something additional

121
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,720
about that

122
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,240
and i guess the question to the room is

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,280
what else needs to go in there and does

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,919
anybody have

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
sort of an idea of what they want that

126
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,758
text to look like or what they need it

127
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,758
to look like

128
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,199
ned might want to talk more about this

129
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
but there was also a related question

130
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,599
about terminology whether

131
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,719
trace field is actually the best thing

132
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,400
to call it

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
right or or whether this should be

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,159
described as

135
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,560
something else right like processing

136
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,960
field or handling field or whatever yes

137
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
yeah yeah yeah yeah um

138
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,880
well ned has turned on his mic

139
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,840
doesn't it have sound not quite yet

140
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,479
and the uh the little chasing arrows

141
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:59,840
down in the lower right corner to reset

142
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:59,840
your audio is quite helpful often

143
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:13,840
well while ned's freaking that out john

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,840
do you want to say something

145
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,000
had to remove one of my co-workers sorry

146
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
john your your mouth is moving but

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
you're not saying anything because your

148
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,840
mute button is still on

149
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
you have video but no audio

150
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,838
that seems more promising yeah right

151
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,120
um when i started saying no i don't want

152
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,839
to say anything but i think i will

153
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
anyway

154
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,600
and uh my apologies for being missing

155
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,680
the first part of your comments

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
uh because i had a little medical

157
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,560
problem

158
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,680
but uh and you may have covered this

159
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,479
already

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,239
um but to respond to two things i heard

161
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,320
the one thing i heard in the sunslide

162
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:08,399
two things i heard uh is that uh

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,600
um there was an argument about putting

164
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,680
this stuff into

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,680
uh um 821

166
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,719
5321 right because these things are put

167
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,439
in

168
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,600
uh by and large although we've now

169
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
started talking about trace fields which

170
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
are

171
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,920
post delivery um

172
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,160
uh they were historically all put in by

173
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,439
the transport mechanism

174
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,760
uh except sometimes for a uh where they

175
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
started trace fields which would have

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,720
been put in by

177
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,479
submission server which was uh until

178
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
fairly recently in the grand scheme of

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,120
these things part of the transport

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,640
mechanism as well

181
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,959
right uh the

182
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,199
the other observation is they have been

183
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,760
called

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,480
trace fields for so long and that

185
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,399
terminology is scattered across enough

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
documents and literature not under the

187
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
ieds control

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,519
the changing that name at this point

189
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,440
would be

190
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,519
almost certain to cause far more

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
disruption problems

192
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,720
and confusion and its worth even if we

193
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
came to the conclusion that

194
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
that if we had a time machine it could

195
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,959
could go back to

196
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,000
uh to the time when 821 was written that

197
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,920
uh uh that we would have decided to call

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,640
it fizzle france

199
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,640
right and and you know like i said uh

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,199
earlier which you may not have heard

201
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
um that sort of descriptive section

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,640
after the abnf

203
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,360
um you know i think it has no impact

204
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
to expand out and be clear about you

205
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,079
know

206
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,000
what that there are other header fields

207
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,599
that sort of get used in a similar way

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
either the transport mechanism is

209
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
introducing them or

210
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,279
a delivery mechanism or a submission

211
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,399
mechanism and so it's expected that

212
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,959
those things will

213
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
you know be added uh in the same place

214
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,719
and

215
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,079
that they you know other mechanisms or

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,279
the uh you know uh the

217
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,599
uh what do you call it uh the

218
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
um

219
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,720
uh my brain's flat the the um

220
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,880
other document the applicability

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
statement might actually describe

222
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,279
the different ways they're used in

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,079
different circumstances or 53-21 bismith

224
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,560
or whatever

225
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,160
so i don't have a problem adding that in

226
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,319
there i'm just looking for

227
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,519
some advice on what people want to add

228
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,959
yeah and and

229
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,959
and of course the reason why this ended

230
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,880
up in five three two two

231
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,560
uh was precisely because these are

232
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,120
header fields as we are

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
right as we treat that other than

234
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
looking at how they were added or by

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,319
whom

236
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,720
um ned looks like he has his microphone

237
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,720
as well

238
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
ned did you want to join the fun as well

239
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:12,480
we're still not hearing ned my mic does

240
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,959
not seem to work yeah that does seem to

241
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,639
be the case

242
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,920
all right um i mean it

243
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,440
so my gut is i'm happy to

244
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,279
um post on the list please somebody give

245
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,160
me advice and if i don't hear back in a

246
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,839
few weeks

247
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,760
i'll make some crap up and then people

248
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,200
can fix it um

249
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
because i'm pretty sure i'm not going to

250
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,279
get it right um

251
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
but you know if people have something to

252
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,279
say on this today let's

253
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,040
say it anybody else want to jump in

254
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,880
otherwise i'm happy to move on to the

255
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,199
next one which i'm hoping is a little

256
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,200
easier

257
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
okay i'll um i will post a request on

258
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,639
the list

259
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,839
uh i'm pretty sure ned says i'm pretty

260
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,399
sure some of the crap

261
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,399
that's added uh stretches the meeting

262
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
all right um so in any event i'll post a

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
query on the list

264
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,040
for someone to come up with some text

265
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,440
for me to add and

266
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,680
uh if i don't hear it a little bit i'll

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,959
make something up and then we can

268
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,399
at least have something to shoot at

269
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,959
all right um do you want to go on to the

270
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,240
next

271
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,239
slide um this one

272
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,440
i i so i can

273
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,560
just as simply put in the one

274
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,639
right i can say that

275
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,839
quoted strings must have something in

276
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
them and

277
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,680
alexi did it is that the following slide

278
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,199
alexi

279
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,638
uh the the the where you went and looked

280
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,639
go to the next slide if you would

281
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,439
um so yeah so um oh it was ashley who

282
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
went through

283
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
and and said you know these things

284
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,439
aren't useful

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,160
and alexi came up with the list below of

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,519
um empty quoted strings just are not

287
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,800
semantically interesting any place

288
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,120
and so the question is whether to

289
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,199
disallow them um the question

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,240
i had was are they actually causing

291
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,439
uh implementability problems

292
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,040
or interoperability problems and if not

293
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,839
is there any harm in just leaving it

294
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,079
alone because any change to the document

295
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,440
makes life unpleasant

296
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,880
but if they are causing

297
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,800
people heartburn uh i i think it's a

298
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,560
small enough change that we can say look

299
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,880
we've had them forever and we can put

300
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,000
them into the uh

301
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,279
the obsolete syntax section and say

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,480
if you're going to use a quoted string

303
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,480
it has to have something in the middle

304
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,839
john looks like you're up

305
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,439
john john yeah i'm gonna get tired of

306
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,959
this very quickly

307
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
pushing the right button now yeah i can

308
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,920
hear you though go ahead

309
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,680
oh well okay uh

310
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:22,160
um the place where these have caused

311
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:24,800
problems is that is in addresses

312
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,319
uh because we've had historical problems

313
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,279
where various things

314
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,120
pick up addresses and quoted strings put

315
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,920
them through processing in the operating

316
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,040
system

317
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,199
and which have their own interpretation

318
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,800
of what to do with quotes

319
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,639
and then quote and unquote and re-quote

320
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,199
and the fact that we've got a double

321
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,680
quoting convention where we've got

322
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,519
uh quoted strings using quote marks and

323
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,959
quoted things using

324
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,759
bank slash um

325
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,518
uh is is is a problem as well and i've

326
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,040
certainly seen

327
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,160
in addresses and in the uh transport

328
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
system

329
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,399
uh problems with these with with quoted

330
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,719
strengths

331
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,440
well that's quoted strings in general

332
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
right not

333
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,320
just empty ones and well

334
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
yes but empty ones have proven a

335
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,560
specific problem

336
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,320
because we've run into operating systems

337
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,119
which look at an empty quoted string and

338
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
feel a need to remove the quotes

339
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,600
right they couldn't remove things and if

340
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
those quoted strings have any semantic

341
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,160
value to anyone which is something i

342
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
haven't seen

343
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,759
yet then they cause a problem

344
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,519
and if they don't cause a problem and

345
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,600
somebody starts comparing

346
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,880
a source string which has quotes to it

347
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
non-source string

348
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
which has the has had the quotes removed

349
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,639
and the comparison

350
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
fails because we don't have rules about

351
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,639
how to make these comparisons

352
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
then we end up with interoperability

353
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,399
problems so

354
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,639
yes we have seen difficulties with these

355
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,800
they are of no earthly use

356
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,759
and uh and if we can get them out of

357
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,959
there it's probably an improvement

358
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,240
does someone want to unless somebody can

359
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,240
make a case that they are

360
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,359
of moral earthly use than i think they

361
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,120
are and uh

362
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,359
right i think all the evidence we have

363
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,958
is that they're not

364
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,639
someone want to make a case for empty

365
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,720
quoted strings

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,160
just slightly playing devil's advocate

367
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,319
um i think the only

368
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,520
case i could think of is display name

369
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,000
so instead of you know quote selects

370
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
email

371
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,640
space melanico just have empty quotes

372
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,559
and it should it's sort of

373
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
seem uh whether i don't know whether

374
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,039
people admit it and

375
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
if we stop allowing for it what will

376
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,520
break

377
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,240
but in all other cases i think my very

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,039
quick

379
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,640
analysis from yesterday suggests that

380
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,600
they are probably more problematic than

381
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,679
they were

382
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,879
so one possibility is to special case

383
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,320
the displayed mk

384
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
uh name case

385
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
to everywhere else but again

386
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,520
i'm not suggesting that that's

387
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,160
necessarily the best idea

388
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,200
and dave i saw a comment in the room do

389
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
you want me to

390
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
just read that or do you want to just

391
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,840
turn on your mic

392
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
i can do either

393
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,720
um so dave crocker says quoting or not

394
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,520
quoting is

395
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,200
not supposed to have semantic meaning um

396
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
it's only intended as an encoding

397
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
mechanism

398
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,678
so absence uh clear concrete

399
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,760
absent clear concrete compelling reports

400
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,799
of significant problems don't change the

401
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,840
spec

402
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,440
just kind of where i started um and

403
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,559
uh if you take a look in 5322 bis

404
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,520
in the note about this errata um

405
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,639
i believe i point to a discussion in

406
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,679
2002

407
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,600
for whatever that's worth um where

408
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
this question came up and people said no

409
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,080
no leave it alone that's

410
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,080
it's just fine the way it is um

411
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,080
so uh

412
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,080
yeah i i'm ambivalent about this one i i

413
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
don't like

414
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,879
changing the syntax but

415
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,799
if it's causing damage and we know it's

416
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,080
causing damage and they're not

417
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,120
used in any particularly useful way

418
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,000
um maybe we do want to correct it

419
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,120
um if if this if somebody were trying to

420
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,919
use one of these things and explain it

421
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,520
presumably to explicitly suppress the

422
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,400
display name

423
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,039
uh why wouldn't they use it as quote

424
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,440
space

425
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:40,559
quote because again the things go away

426
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,039
uh but there but there is an alternative

427
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
here

428
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,640
if uh if people feel like this is too

429
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,840
radical a change

430
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,160
for uh uh for the five three two

431
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,760
two syntax uh which is to detach

432
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,880
the definition of quoted string in uh

433
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,240
in five three two one bis from

434
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,679
uh uh from the five three two two bis

435
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,520
definition

436
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,600
and take it out there because because in

437
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,039
five three two one the only thing it

438
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,840
affects is addresses and that's where

439
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,919
i've seen the part

440
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,720
it's mailbox names and that's where i've

441
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,720
seen the problems

442
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,640
right and and you know that that's

443
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
that's been the case consistently you

444
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,600
know for a long time that

445
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,280
uh 5321 um

446
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,559
821 dot dot dot uh has always been the

447
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,320
place that sort of

448
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,158
well yeah those are all nice and that

449
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,918
was syntactically fine in the message

450
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,520
but when you're actually doing something

451
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,640
and taking that and putting it into

452
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,840
an smtp command stream you fix it

453
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,320
so uh dave's follow-up by the way

454
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,280
is the issue is not that it's suboptimal

455
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,600
or unappealing

456
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,720
but that it's not known to cause serious

457
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,439
problems

458
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,799
uh uh i thought the goal for this round

459
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,559
of effort with the specs

460
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,918
was to make minimum changes required

461
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,799
this one isn't required

462
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
so yeah equivalent to what i was saying

463
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,760
earlier

464
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,559
but john you're saying that you've

465
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,879
actually seen empty strings

466
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,799
float in empty quoted strings float in

467
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,000
and they have caused problems

468
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,799
on the smtp okay ends

469
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,799
what what what i've seen as as the most

470
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,080
extreme example

471
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,918
is from mini writing a mailbox name

472
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,199
which i guess we would describe as

473
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,880
bracket

474
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,799
uh quote quote at sign domain name

475
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,640
right hello and when somebody fixes that

476
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,840
they end up with a syntax error although

477
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
the original is

478
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,320
uh is nearly stupid as this thing from

479
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,919
invalid

480
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,720
so so i would argue that because we've

481
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,240
seen damage

482
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,520
there that if uh

483
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,120
if someone wants to pursue this i would

484
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,879
hope it i would hope i'm not

485
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,879
yet but i may have to be

486
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,880
we dropped the 5322 discussion

487
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,760
just on the basis that we haven't seen

488
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:11,200
enough evidence of serious damage there

489
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,520
uh and that we uh we fixed five through

490
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,039
two

491
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,879
one uh which is to explain why this is a

492
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,640
bad idea in local parties

493
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
take that take this out and explain why

494
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,440
it's a bad idea

495
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,559
now one effect of that is that you would

496
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
never end up seeing

497
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:33,120
an empty quoted string in a

498
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,559
in an smtp provided trace field

499
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,158
but and and uh

500
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:42,639
i'll jabber there we get back the

501
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,440
question whether

502
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
prohibiting that in 5321 causes damage

503
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,679
and

504
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,799
uh and that gets us back to the argument

505
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,039
that there's no evidence taking the

506
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,480
child causes any damage at all

507
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,559
right and so ned then says this

508
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,320
ned says over in the jabra room this is

509
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,520
a layering violation since we don't

510
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,678
specify the process

511
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,200
for canonicalizing addresses we don't

512
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,080
have any way of telling what's legal for

513
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,400
a given

514
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
admd and what is not it's perfectly

515
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,480
permissible for an admd to

516
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,080
allow an empty local part represented

517
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,080
syntactically as a pair of quotes

518
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:24,400
or not

519
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,919
for the wonderful coffee sound in

520
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,640
background if you can hear it

521
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,320
um yeah i'm just wondering shall we just

522
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
test this

523
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,200
i mean it should be fairly simple to

524
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,799
generate message with

525
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,960
empty quotes in various kind of places

526
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,000
like receive header field and

527
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,720
just by a name and i can even generate

528
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,840
keywords

529
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,840
at the field

530
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
we don't want to change the spec unless

531
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,279
it's clear signs of damage and

532
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
uh and there may be no clear signs of

533
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,360
damage

534
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:18,000
in uh in five three two two

535
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,120
um and uh and my difficulty is that

536
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,400
because these things which mess with

537
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
quotes

538
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,640
tend to be operating system dependent uh

539
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,080
we could undoubtedly find two systems we

540
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,440
could send these things to where they

541
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,279
would work fine

542
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,559
and two systems where we could send

543
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,840
these things to

544
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,158
where they would not look fine and

545
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,039
fortunate unfortunately most examples i

546
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,559
know of

547
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,879
are operating systems which are not in

548
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,440
heavy use anymore

549
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
for example windows 95 used to screw

550
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
this up

551
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,080
and maybe we can say who cares except we

552
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,799
don't know what other artifacts are

553
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:04,080
lying around

554
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,760
just so you know it took me about

555
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,240
35 seconds to find examples of uh

556
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,960
of empty quarter strings in my email

557
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,400
archive

558
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,520
it's in use in this play name

559
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,880
in addresses or somewhere else

560
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,158
and in display name i mean

561
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,919
okay cool called angle bracket

562
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,919
address angle brackets

563
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,880
there are two

564
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,760
algorithms i know of in was

565
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,320
that about what to do with the display

566
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,080
name when the user doesn't supply one

567
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,918
and one of those algorithms is to supply

568
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,439
an empty quoted string

569
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,440
okay and the other is to uh

570
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,640
is the more common practice of copying

571
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,799
the email address

572
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
it's copying the mailbox name into the

573
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,120
display name and

574
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:05,760
sometimes quoting it i don't know

575
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,360
yes but but but but this is stupid mua

576
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,879
syndrome and we don't have to encourage

577
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,240
it

578
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,000
yep and the thing is with we can't uh

579
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,080
given uh that it's prevalent we can't

580
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,240
we can't tell people to throw away

581
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,720
messages that are syntactically illegal

582
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,640
when they

583
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
when they're when they're there so we

584
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
can't disallow

585
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
so so i'm hearing actually a resolution

586
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,120
in some sense

587
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,918
which is um this is not a 5322 issue to

588
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,080
solve and if there is an issue to solve

589
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:42,400
we toss this over to 53

590
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,799
21 to deal with the handling at the smtp

591
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,880
layer of local parts that are empty

592
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:52,799
and um we go on from there

593
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,240
uh well there's another alternative

594
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,480
which has the same effect as far as

595
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,840
you're concerned pete

596
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,960
which is to go into the a.s and say yeah

597
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,879
right uh these th these things are bad

598
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
news and sometimes they get distorted

599
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,039
and stink and

600
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,559
and sometimes they produce bad results

601
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,039
in muas

602
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,240
and uh and you know if you're gonna do

603
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,840
this expect it isn't gonna work

604
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,520
sometimes

605
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,039
right okay so i i feel for

606
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,000
my purposes um this one is pretty much

607
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,200
done um and alexi i'll leave it to you

608
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,679
whether you want to

609
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,240
convert the issue to something other

610
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,320
than a 5322 issue or whether you want to

611
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,799
close the close this one assuming the

612
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,840
list is okay with this and obviously

613
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,720
we'll we'll post that in in summary and

614
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,600
if the list is cool with this idea then

615
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,039
reintroduce

616
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,399
a new issue for 5321 or the as

617
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,158
or however you want to do it yeah

618
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,840
probably makes sense to convert it if

619
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,000
we're just moving this text to

620
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,918
a yes document yeah okay um

621
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,399
yeah i do think we need working group

622
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,279
decisions to win this ghost 5321

623
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,719
or the as you're right right right right

624
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,039
yes okay

625
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,559
so that that sounds like a good summary

626
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,120
to bring to the list and

627
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,720
and make sure everybody's on board uh

628
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,959
shall we go on to the next slide

629
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,640
oh the answer to uh harold's question is

630
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
yes the

631
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,679
op syntax is still in there hasn't

632
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,080
changed

633
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,520
um this one is an interesting errata

634
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,720
that was filed

635
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,760
um which was hey wait a minute the

636
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,480
header field name

637
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,000
does not have a length limit in its uh

638
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,279
description

639
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,399
and um this one is

640
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,520
uh yet another example of well it

641
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,678
doesn't

642
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,760
but no one has really screwed it up yet

643
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,440
do we want to change the syntax

644
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,120
to say that it really can't be more than

645
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,640
77 characters long

646
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,719
to leave space for the colon and the

647
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,919
space after it um

648
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,559
and uh yeah

649
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,559
uh um

650
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,000
i i guess for me i i i'm looking for

651
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,919
a reason to put in the 77

652
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and you know then adding to the ops

653
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,279
syntax to indicate that we used to say

654
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,960
that it could be whatever length you

655
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,039
wanted but it really can't

656
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,440
um i just i'm not sure it's worth doing

657
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,360
uh i'm i i'm not either but the case i

658
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,640
would be most concerned about

659
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,559
again comes back to these invented trace

660
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,240
fields where one could

661
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:37,678
given current trends easily see uh

662
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:41,840
x dash flowers dash bloom dash

663
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,840
in the spring dash

664
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,000
i think someone actually did a survey of

665
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,360
these through quite a few

666
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,200
mailboxes of different uh origins

667
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,520
and found the longest one out there was

668
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,399
something on the order of 25 characters

669
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,200
or something

670
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,520
or some such i don't remember who did it

671
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,360
but

672
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,879
but the trend is people invented this

673
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,080
idiocy has certainly been for them to

674
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,200
get longer

675
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,520
now asymptotically i don't know how long

676
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,480
it takes us to get from 25 characters to

677
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,639
77

678
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
but

679
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,760
but if if this is really our last cut at

680
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,480
this at least a warning is probably in

681
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,279
order that

682
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,279
uh that there is this length limit

683
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,520
overall and if the uh

684
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,120
if the trace fields exceed it then if

685
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
the field names exceed it

686
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,479
then then they will get themselves into

687
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,918
trouble sooner or later

688
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,279
right and again we can again

689
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,880
well you put a warning like that in the

690
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,880
as if you don't want to fight through

691
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,000
two-two

692
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,120
yeah i i don't feel strongly about that

693
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,480
so i'm willing to take advice

694
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,520
um i'm tempted to say it's a b

695
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
f comment but you know i know strong

696
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
feelings about this

697
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,039
this is a b f comment that if you make

698
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:05,840
these stupidly long you'll get in

699
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:05,840
trouble would certainly meet my needs

700
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:19,679
um i think that's the last of the issues

701
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:22,000
we had to discuss for 53.22 am i correct

702
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,000
yes

703
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,880
all right um

704
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,640
uh kurt says making it explicit we'll

705
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,440
start for lots of semicircular arguments

706
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,399
amongst people

707
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,399
having difficulty counting um yeah uh

708
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,200
yeah like i said i i i'm

709
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,639
you know it's the it's the working

710
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,840
group's choice

711
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,039
but i'm personally with editor hat off

712
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,720
of the mind that

713
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,640
the less changes um the better

714
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
uh ned says you can't break a header

715
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
field name so the effect is that you

716
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,559
should limit these things to 78

717
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,679
characters including the colon

718
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,678
right um

719
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,639
all right um that sounds to me like a

720
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,000
perfectly good

721
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,360
uh uh comment in the av and f per alexis

722
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,120
observation

723
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,519
and that's not really a change in the

724
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,639
sense that you're worried about changes

725
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,399
yeah yeah yeah

726
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,640
all right um well i'll get

727
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,518
what summary we've heard here posted to

728
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,200
the list

729
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,760
um for these issues and

730
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,960
uh assuming everybody is happy with what

731
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,000
i describe them as we'll go forward

732
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,919
and do something so i will uh pass the

733
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,919
baton over to john at this point

734
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,439
all right shuffled issues a little bit

735
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,600
starting with slightly easier first

736
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:11,840
well which i think are now easier but

737
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:11,840
you know obviously

738
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,918
i see i'm permanently in queue and it

739
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,919
won't let me leave it

740
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,000
ah

741
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,360
to present something john if you turn

742
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,880
that off yeah well yeah

743
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,479
well as as as indicated earlier i'm

744
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,840
not prepared for this um

745
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,200
i'm also having a great deal of

746
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,120
difficulty reading the screen

747
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,640
um would you like me to read it

748
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,639
if it helps no it's okay

749
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,840
um

750
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,480
this opens the worms the cat of worms is

751
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,399
not the uh

752
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,839
it's not the registry of the absence of

753
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,279
the registry but

754
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,759
uh but this whole issue of uh

755
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,639
of relay and delivery which gets back to

756
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,720
uh

757
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,040
uh to dave crocker's comment on the list

758
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,040
um

759
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,639
uh i can make a strong argument against

760
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,159
taking those out entirely which is

761
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,599
not what this is about uh if we want yet

762
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,639
another registry let's create yet

763
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,839
another registry

764
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,440
but uh but uh i

765
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,759
uh uh but again this gets us tangled up

766
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,240
with

767
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,919
uh uh with who's responsible right with

768
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,959
which document is responsible for their

769
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,040
fields

770
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,079
uh it gets us tangled up with a lot of

771
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,679
semi-historical things

772
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,800
about uh about gateways which are not

773
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,040
precisely relay devices relays

774
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:07,359
and uh and uh and all of the reasons why

775
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:11,040
smtp uh was very carefully designed

776
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:14,319
back to uh uh to create

777
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,680
craig parcher's little amendment uh

778
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,480
to uh to operate in a

779
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
uh in a terrible connectivity

780
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,839
environment

781
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,520
and uh there's a case you made that we

782
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,480
ought to be ripping a whole lot of that

783
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,839
out

784
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,480
because we don't have as many

785
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,960
interconnected

786
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,200
non-tcp networks as we used to

787
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,400
and maybe in all needs rethinking but

788
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,640
that of course would be a

789
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
change so significantly back in proposed

790
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,720
standard a second

791
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,839
so i'm i'm indifferent to this i

792
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,879
recorded it

793
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,440
um i don't have strong preferences one

794
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,440
way or the other

795
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,879
based on the mailing list responses so

796
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,280
far

797
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,640
i think people question whether expert

798
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,800
review is a

799
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,720
good policy for this because of how many

800
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,839
proprietary header fields there are so

801
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,480
we can do first come first serve

802
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:15,119
um my personal concern in this case

803
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,520
would be

804
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,760
um if people don't add information

805
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,000
which is right they say it's like it's

806
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
only been done by relay but it's done by

807
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,200
other entities

808
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,880
who can correct the information so

809
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,879
but we're not talking about removing

810
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,800
other fields but just correcting it so

811
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,960
how do we want to go about this

812
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
but but that's but that's also true of

813
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,040
expert review ultimately

814
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,640
uh somebody somebody ends up having the

815
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,680
referee who can make changes

816
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,598
if the uh if the person who originally

817
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,410
proposed registration isn't responding

818
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,480
stimuli

819
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,480
[Music]

820
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,520
um

821
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,200
you know i i've got a general bias that

822
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,839
registries are a good idea because they

823
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,279
prevent

824
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,880
uh conflicting uses of names but uh

825
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,560
but i'm not certain that applies in this

826
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,440
case and uh

827
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,119
and yes if people start squatting on

828
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,800
names if we end up with

829
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:19,280
uh correction problems if we end up with

830
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,280
incorrect information problems um

831
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,440
it's an issue and maybe this is one of

832
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,920
the ones where we ought to leave the uh

833
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,640
the registry of wikipedia rather than to

834
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,599
uh

835
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,240
to ayanna which is to say wash our hands

836
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,240
on the problem

837
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,000
this is barry this is not talking about

838
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,839
a registry that's going to avoid name

839
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,280
collisions because the name collisions

840
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,200
are already taken care of by the

841
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,599
registry that they are required to be in

842
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,839
this is a registry about the usage of

843
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,839
them

844
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,680
yeah i guess i'm ambivalent about it

845
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,200
also i don't

846
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,160
see a strong reason to wrap ourselves

847
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,759
around

848
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,598
axles with this

849
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,520
i i would say we should defer the

850
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:12,880
discussion of it

851
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,920
to the a.s and do it in the a.s

852
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,240
if we think it's necessary

853
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,680
that's certainly an answer and uh and of

854
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,839
course we can defer the discussion to

855
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,440
the bas and then lose it

856
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,000
um you know part part of what

857
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,839
causes me concern about this is that we

858
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,040
have

859
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,560
never really tried to seriously and

860
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,400
precisely define the uh the situation

861
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,520
in which something is running as a

862
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,400
relatively passive relay at the

863
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,240
administrative boundary of the delivery

864
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,400
environment

865
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,959
but the real delivery mta is behind it

866
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,079
um this situation occurs rather

867
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,920
frequently with

868
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,079
uh with enterprise firewalls which are

869
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
answering to smtp because the only way

870
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,079
they can

871
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,839
filter whatever's they're trying to

872
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,960
filter and

873
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,880
and because we've never really tried to

874
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,200
define that administrative boundary

875
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:20,720
stuff in any way that affects

876
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:24,960
5321 although there's language in the uh

877
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,839
in dave's architecture document uh

878
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,839
i i think we're opening cancer worms

879
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
here

880
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,320
let me quickly read nat's comments so

881
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,680
he said i'm actually in favor of

882
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,560
including more information in the

883
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,359
registry

884
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,440
and then preventing people with

885
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,200
suggestions as to when to use something

886
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,640
and when not to use i'm having a hard

887
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,480
time saying this is a bad thing

888
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:56,560
that would work for me i i

889
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,280
am ambivalent as well

890
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,520
so i think tentatively i've heard that

891
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,520
we'll probably do this in a s document

892
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,400
uh

893
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,480
and there is some support for it

894
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,000
okay so since this is the second

895
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,280
referral

896
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,760
and i am the current unwilling pen

897
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,520
holder for the as document

898
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
have we made any progress on finding a

899
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,759
set finding an editor who can actually

900
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,160
keep track of these things

901
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,359
uh no but it's on our to-do list we need

902
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,598
to talk to the

903
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,960
interview the person who volunteered and

904
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,960
i asked for more volunteers

905
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,319
uh it's on your to-do list for soon or

906
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,760
uh

907
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:45,200
or after the next year meeting starts

908
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,839
uh you're really putting me on the spot

909
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,598
no i

910
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,240
will try to deal with it like within a

911
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,240
couple of weeks

912
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
okay

913
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
let's see you your lips look like

914
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,000
they're moving you suddenly stop

915
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,839
talking sorry i muted myself and then i

916
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,720
was saying let's move on to the next one

917
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,720
um right so this one is

918
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,440
um

919
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,440
for uh abnf lovers among us

920
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,960
and this turned out to be actually quite

921
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,119
complicated in details

922
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,480
uh but i think it's a good thing to

923
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,760
start this here just to

924
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,880
get an idea how people feel about it

925
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,160
so um basically

926
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,599
uh the war ii

927
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,920
er atoms submitted uh

928
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,400
one was rejected then there was a more

929
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,720
extended one suggesting to align this

930
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,640
with rfc

931
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,879
3986 which is uri spec

932
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,118
and rfc 5952 which is um

933
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,839
like human readable syntax for ipv6

934
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,839
addresses

935
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,839
basically john did a very good job

936
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,560
updating it to match your ice pack

937
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,880
but your ice pack doesn't quite conform

938
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,078
to

939
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,079
59 52

940
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,560
well i mean you know they were published

941
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,680
at different times so

942
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,599
that's not entirely surprising so

943
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,720
if you see on the next slide

944
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,079
yeah so um like leading zeros

945
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,480
as well as uh

946
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,599
hex digits are supposed to be all in

947
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,760
lowercase

948
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,720
um in recommendation um

949
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,000
so before we actually go to my straw man

950
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,839
um

951
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,079
question is is there

952
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,400
let's say just for the sake of argument

953
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,000
that we mandate that

954
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,160
all hex digits are going to be lower

955
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,560
case is this going to be interrupt

956
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,560
problem

957
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
um

958
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,440
all right so ned said he posted a

959
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:28,240
message to the mailing list which

960
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,920
unfortunately i haven't seen um

961
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,240
he suggests we take it to the mailing

962
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,240
list

963
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:41,119
um i'm i'm in favor of that

964
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,440
one observation uh which

965
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,160
is that if people are going to point to

966
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,160
this mess

967
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,720
then there needs to be a dividend in my

968
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,879
strong recommendation

969
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,118
to the isu uh which i hope i don't have

970
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,400
to make in the form of an appeal

971
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,079
uh is that uh we need to straighten out

972
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,280
this ipd6 syntax

973
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,359
and make it definitive and uh and that's

974
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,119
probably something which given where

975
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:14,640
this started needs to come out of the uh

976
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:18,079
um presumably the uh

977
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,319
um uh the internet area

978
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,880
and the ip area and uh

979
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,800
and updates all of these stray documents

980
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,079
which have their own strange ideas about

981
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,319
syntax

982
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,000
and when that's done then it becomes

983
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,359
appropriate to change

984
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,160
5321 to match whatever it is that says

985
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,119
but what has happened here is that we

986
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,480
put syntax

987
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,640
into 2821 which matched the then

988
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,760
theories to what idv6 addresses looked

989
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,118
like

990
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,760
we put syntax into 5321 which matched

991
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,599
the dense syntax as to what ipv6

992
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,240
addresses looked like

993
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,280
and uh and now we're talking about

994
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,839
changing

995
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,760
five three two one bish to match

996
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,040
whatever we think ip addresses look like

997
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:09,119
which has changed each time

998
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,720
and uh and i'm in principle opposed to

999
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,560
changing it again

1000
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:18,319
unless there's a clear statement of

1001
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,400
itf wide applicability as to what ipd6

1002
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:23,440
address is supposed to look like

1003
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,520
uh ideally either there or then we do

1004
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,720
something in five three two one

1005
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,160
uh or an as uh which says different

1006
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,560
historical reasons you want to permit

1007
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,680
the following kinds of flexibility

1008
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,040
uh but uh and again we can take that to

1009
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,680
the list

1010
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,599
but i'm uh i'm at least mildly opposed

1011
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,720
to changing this

1012
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,680
uh uh a

1013
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,160
third time as the tides go in and out in

1014
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,040
various

1015
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,040
documents defining network

1016
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,119
i don't know who that was or where it

1017
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,640
came from no i had no idea

1018
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,960
um uh but as uh

1019
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,160
as as as various documents come up with

1020
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,359
their own theories to what this order

1021
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,319
look like

1022
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,880
we need an ietfly definitive syntax for

1023
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,240
this

1024
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,800
and then everybody else has to start

1025
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,799
adapting

1026
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,640
sounds great

1027
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
right and i'll just quickly show the

1028
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,200
next uh

1029
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,680
slide which shows complicated at

1030
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:37,200
um 5952 is actually inconsistent with

1031
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,200
itself so there are issues there

1032
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:46,240
okay yeah in in general

1033
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,480
i am opposed to changing

1034
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,759
and and this is reminiscent of pete's

1035
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,000
comment with the

1036
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,160
observation that we changed it we made

1037
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,280
we were making more mistakes

1038
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,399
i'm opposed to making changes in 5321

1039
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,480
because of things that uh

1040
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:06,720
the 5952 and especially 3986

1041
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:11,440
decide to do deciding creatively to do

1042
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,480
or not to

1043
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,480
right understood

1044
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,200
okay next slide

1045
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,319
so this one might be a very little issue

1046
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,880
or it might be big grenade i have no

1047
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,319
idea

1048
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,319
so uh let's just have a go with it

1049
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,480
so uh john you pointed out that there is

1050
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,680
a definition of

1051
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,720
domain names uh and well

1052
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,799
um domain names as used in smtp and it

1053
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,839
says only dissolvable fully qualified

1054
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,839
and the main names are permitted

1055
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,279
you suggested clarifying resolvable in

1056
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,400
the public dns

1057
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:04,160
um i am sort of

1058
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,680
personally suggesting to go the other

1059
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,558
way by saying if i

1060
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:13,680
just removing resolvable because i think

1061
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,640
whenever you talk about resolvability of

1062
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,480
domain names

1063
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,279
it's quite clear in the context in the

1064
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,280
rest of the document

1065
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,559
but let's have a just quick discussion

1066
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,559
of this if we can

1067
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,880
this is

1068
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:41,280
language which is connected

1069
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,280
ultimately to the pastel principle

1070
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,000
um

1071
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,119
we've avoided in 5321 and its relatives

1072
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,119
creating the sort of uh

1073
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:01,040
you can send this but you

1074
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:04,079
um uh you you can receive this but you

1075
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:06,800
shouldn't send it stuff

1076
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,480
and much as it might be appropriate in

1077
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,640
some places that would be a fairly major

1078
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:15,440
change in the

1079
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:18,720
text the reason for resolvable

1080
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,880
is that without resolvable uh

1081
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,720
fully qualified domain name begins to

1082
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,079
look a whole lot like

1083
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,240
something with with uh um

1084
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,599
with with some ascii characters and some

1085
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,839
thoughts in it as long as you don't have

1086
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,440
two consecutive dots

1087
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,799
uh and indeed um

1088
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,720
without those church and ascii

1089
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,880
characters not because of

1090
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,078
uh of the smtp utf-8 work

1091
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,359
but because um

1092
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:52,800
modulo syntax restrictions

1093
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:56,000
in 821

1094
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:00,559
which made their way into

1095
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,240
um uh 11 34 and 11 35 is the preferred

1096
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,359
syntax

1097
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:09,598
uh uh there's you know

1098
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:12,880
no domain name need for this restriction

1099
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,240
um so resolvable is the only thing which

1100
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,920
differentiates

1101
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,399
a domain name which you can look up

1102
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,599
someplace in your context

1103
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,920
uh from from gibberish

1104
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:23,920
um

1105
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,240
again i'm a little lucky to start

1106
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:33,680
fooling with this unless we introduce

1107
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,720
unexpected problems uh but

1108
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,879
uh but when readers come to the

1109
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,078
conclusion that if it says this

1110
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,839
you want to start testing and rejecting

1111
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,200
in various places um

1112
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:52,078
we're we're pushing historical boundary

1113
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,520
uh and uh and maybe the right thing to

1114
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,280
do is to have the ais

1115
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,880
explain that historical boundary of

1116
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,960
people but

1117
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,800
uh but i'm uh i'm reluctant to take

1118
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,079
resolvable out

1119
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:10,480
and again however uh this

1120
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,720
thing is uh uh came

1121
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,160
to me and i don't feel nearly as

1122
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,279
strongly

1123
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,520
uh as uh as as

1124
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,119
this slide might indicate about how we

1125
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,480
might handle this

1126
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:28,000
um public dns is an issue

1127
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,800
um uh i don't know if it's helpful or

1128
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,240
not especially we get that trace fields

1129
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,079
to uh to restrict people from putting

1130
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,359
nonsense there

1131
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:42,559
um localhost israel is not a

1132
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:45,040
for a publicly resolvable domain name

1133
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,880
or a domain name in the public dns

1134
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,400
depending on who you ask for the context

1135
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,599
you're talking about

1136
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:53,280
and again the variation of the

1137
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,520
robustness principle which is a little

1138
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,920
good sense goes a long way

1139
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:01,440
uh would be uh helpfully applied here

1140
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,520
yeah there's nothing you know we're

1141
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,520
trying to accomplish

1142
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,720
there's nothing in here that says public

1143
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:09,680
so

1144
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,520
uh use within a particular

1145
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,879
administrative domain where something

1146
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,599
might be resolvable that isn't

1147
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,520
resolvable outside is an issue

1148
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,960
there are a whole lot of issues here

1149
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,040
there are a whole lot of dragons

1150
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,520
involved with changing this

1151
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,200
i think i feel fairly strongly that for

1152
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,040
the stability of the document

1153
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,240
and the other documents that reference

1154
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,720
it we should not

1155
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,319
change it and we can discuss the issue

1156
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,959
in the ais

1157
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:40,480
but not change what we say here

1158
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,800
yeah i i i think that's right and uh

1159
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,839
and i'd add that if we start trying to

1160
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,720
parse this and

1161
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,240
and put qualifiers and details here

1162
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,000
we're rapidly going to have to separate

1163
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,000
domain names and addresses from domain

1164
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,640
names and various other places

1165
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,280
and that introduces complexity and the

1166
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,799
uh

1167
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,040
and the potential for errors that we

1168
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:00,880
really don't need

1169
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,400
unless there's a compelling reason for

1170
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,400
doing this and i haven't seen it yet

1171
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:12,240
right so comments from that was

1172
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,160
he was agreeing with me uh there are

1173
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,799
many private use cases so i don't know

1174
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,319
whether

1175
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,559
uh i think nat is probably not

1176
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:21,440
are you happy with no change or are you

1177
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:24,960
happy was

1178
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,760
deleting resolvable still uh dave

1179
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,839
said that he wants no change he thinks

1180
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,079
some ambiguity is actually a good thing

1181
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,078
here

1182
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,279
and that's still things that he wants to

1183
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,919
drop reservable

1184
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,079
i think removing the word resolvable is

1185
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,880
likely to have consequences we are not

1186
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,359
aware of

1187
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,960
and won't find out about until it's too

1188
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,640
late

1189
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,920
yeah i actually think that

1190
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,960
the places where it talks about relate

1191
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,880
to the next hope

1192
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,079
this is where it talks about resolvable

1193
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,160
anyway so

1194
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,720
there is no need to be resolvable in

1195
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,920
this section that's my

1196
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:09,359
point uh

1197
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,319
again my my concern is about unintended

1198
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:13,359
consequences of making that move

1199
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,759
i think i think you're right

1200
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,520
incidentally but my concern is about

1201
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,000
unintended consequences of making that

1202
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,839
move

1203
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,839
and and

1204
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:26,000
the next top problem interacts with the

1205
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,400
gateway problem

1206
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,400
um

1207
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,680
you know i don't know right it looks

1208
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,680
like

1209
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:40,720
we're sort of don't have quite enough

1210
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,759
consensus between dropping resolvable or

1211
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,439
no change but

1212
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,640
i think we definitely don't want to say

1213
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,480
add in public

1214
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,640
dns here which is a good thing i suppose

1215
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,319
let's take it to the mailing list

1216
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,960
because we need to

1217
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,558
figure out what we want here yeah the

1218
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,559
reason if i remember the original

1219
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,720
discussion for the ad for the

1220
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:08,480
request to add the public dns was

1221
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,598
uh was simply that if the domain name

1222
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,760
appears

1223
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,440
someplace that a recipient has to get

1224
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,480
hold has to do something with

1225
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,440
it then if it's put in by

1226
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,960
somewhere near the center and if it's

1227
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,480
put in some place where the recipient

1228
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,599
has to deal with this

1229
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,960
then the recipient has no hope of res of

1230
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:31,119
interpreting anything else and

1231
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,839
uh and that's the argument i don't find

1232
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,839
it particularly compelling

1233
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:44,160
all right um so this actually um

1234
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,319
made me wonder whether i should split

1235
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,040
the ticket two to two

1236
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,240
one is about whether it should me say

1237
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,680
resolvable here

1238
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:56,799
and the other about private domain names

1239
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:59,279
i think private domain names we agreed

1240
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:03,280
we don't want to talk about it here but

1241
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,040
maybe in as

1242
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,760
does it help to split the tickets what

1243
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,759
do you think john

1244
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:17,040
my personal preference

1245
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:17,920
uh partially because i i'm afraid of

1246
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,839
side effects of

1247
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,400
touching stuff like this rather than

1248
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,640
because i'm opposed

1249
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,000
but my personal preference is would be

1250
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,078
to put a discussion into the ais

1251
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,040
about what resolvable means and how one

1252
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,000
might interpret it

1253
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,960
in particular strongly discouraging the

1254
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,160
uh

1255
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,440
uh the uh

1256
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,839
um uh attempt to resolve anything you

1257
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,839
see when when it recedes

1258
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,319
keeping in mind that one of the reasons

1259
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,160
why resolvable is here

1260
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:59,119
is that if a domain name

1261
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:01,520
appears in a mail from a mail command

1262
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,760
uh and the message reaches the other end

1263
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,240
and somebody tries to do a reply

1264
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:10,960
or even uh bounce a message

1265
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,000
um that if that is not a public

1266
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,000
resolvable type

1267
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
domain name it's hopeless

1268
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,680
and again i'd be happier

1269
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,200
having a lucky editor put text to that

1270
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,280
effect

1271
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,558
explain that situation or warning about

1272
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,920
it in the a.s

1273
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,920
and tampering with this text

1274
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,000
but but that's strongly influenced by my

1275
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,079
bias against

1276
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,480
tampering with things whose consequences

1277
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,720
we can't fully anticipate

1278
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,720
right

1279
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:58,640
okay so uh

1280
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,599
i hope uh seth is taking good notes for

1281
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,720
this section

1282
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,400
i i i think uh yeah

1283
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,919
well very good notes for this section

1284
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,799
we're also about

1285
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,920
two and a half minutes away from the end

1286
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,920
which is just as well

1287
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:22,078
yeah because the next one might be a red

1288
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,440
hole

1289
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,440
you can have a two minutes over at home

1290
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,780
um

1291
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,779
[Music]

1292
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,640
let me explain what i think this is

1293
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,759
about

1294
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,118
without taking any position at all

1295
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,839
sounds good historically we have argued

1296
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:45,200
that there are

1297
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,200
two kinds of

1298
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,040
of things which make one address into

1299
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:57,440
more addresses and send them out

1300
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,960
uh to avoid using any of any other

1301
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,960
vocabularies gets complicated

1302
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,720
one of those things operates strictly at

1303
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,720
smtp level

1304
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,920
and may not work anymore because of

1305
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,440
other things we've done to the internet

1306
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,119
but that's not an smtp

1307
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:20,079
problem uh

1308
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,000
and those things should not be messing

1309
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,280
with anything but trace fields

1310
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,280
because they shouldn't need to

1311
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:35,279
uh the other kind

1312
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,359
as uh dave explained on the mailing list

1313
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,680
better than i can do with at this hour

1314
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,480
in the morning

1315
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,160
are things where the mail is delivered

1316
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,599
to something

1317
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:51,440
which then simulates an exploding mua

1318
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,520
type of thing and sends it back out

1319
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,640
and in that situation all kinds of

1320
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,880
interesting things get

1321
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,839
changed because it's actually a new

1322
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:04,400
message which

1323
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:07,520
the message coming into that pseudo mua

1324
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,400
past the delivery server uh basically

1325
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,079
constituted

1326
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,640
an a request to turn in some other

1327
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:16,079
message and redistribute it

1328
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:17,759
and in that second model uh adding list

1329
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,799
fields is entirely reasonably

1330
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,079
appropriate

1331
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:23,359
but it has nothing to do with first

1332
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:25,680
model so

1333
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:28,880
in some sense the question here is not

1334
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:33,200
whether to diddle around with list

1335
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:36,559
star fields uh in 5321

1336
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:41,359
it's a question as to whether to

1337
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,359
eliminate or cl eliminate that

1338
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,200
mta level exploder option

1339
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,759
entirely or or clarify it out of

1340
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,759
existence

1341
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:59,119
and in a dmarc world you know as i say i

1342
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,119
don't know if it's viable anymore

1343
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:09,920
so i think what you're saying is uh

1344
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,240
this restriction is valid for mta level

1345
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,119
explorer but not

1346
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,799
for the mailing list so level explorer

1347
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,200
if there's such a way

1348
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,920
and alexi dave crocker's had his hand up

1349
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,799
in the queue

1350
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,799
for a couple minutes

1351
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:31,599
all right uh dave you go ahead

1352
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,599
and you probably have the closing words

1353
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:39,280
so we need to remember just how far back

1354
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,079
this section got written what we didn't

1355
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,240
know

1356
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,799
what what alternatives we didn't have

1357
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,479
that we now have

1358
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:49,280
i understand the reason for thinking

1359
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,119
that aliases are at the mta level

1360
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,720
because in an implement implementation

1361
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:55,839
sense they typically are

1362
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:59,038
but architecturally they aren't the mail

1363
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:00,960
is delivered the alias mechanism happens

1364
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,079
to be a very streamlined

1365
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:07,599
uh capability but it is architecturally

1366
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:08,400
uh after delivery just like mailing

1367
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,079
lists

1368
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,760
the fact that they're super streamlined

1369
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,799
and they and they don't mess around with

1370
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,559
a lot of the data

1371
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,160
and they preserve a lot of the data

1372
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,319
makes it really easy to think that it's

1373
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:19,759
part of the relaying process but aliases

1374
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,079
are not part of relaying

1375
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,520
they come after delivery they are a

1376
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,440
reposting mechanism

1377
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,559
that just preserves the heck out of the

1378
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,400
message that it got

1379
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,039
whereas mailing lists don't do that much

1380
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,480
preservation

1381
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,599
the reality today is that that this

1382
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,799
world of

1383
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,599
um additional handling has gotten uh so

1384
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,720
much more

1385
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:45,599
uh uh elaborate and better documented

1386
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,598
that um

1387
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,599
there's just no way 5321 is going to do

1388
01:02:48,880 --> 01:03:03,680
justice

1389
01:02:49,599 --> 01:03:07,280
to these topics anymore

1390
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,000
my concern about that view of the

1391
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,000
architecture

1392
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,960
takes us back to the gateway and psi

1393
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,200
gateway and pseudo gateway problem which

1394
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,319
is

1395
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:21,520
itself a can of worms

1396
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:24,960
and the possible need to apply aliases

1397
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:28,000
there in order to make addresses work

1398
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,960
in the environment that the other side

1399
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,400
of the thing which is

1400
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:35,599
fussy and we

1401
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:39,119
don't have a clear boundary

1402
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:41,599
between relays and

1403
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,640
things which move mail into slightly

1404
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:46,559
different kinds of systems

1405
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,920
gateways and almost gateways and other

1406
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:51,680
things

1407
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,440
and i'm reluctant for that reason and

1408
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,839
some others

1409
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,920
to eliminate

1410
01:03:56,839 --> 01:04:03,599
the mta

1411
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,720
level alias if you like uh

1412
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,440
expansion capability or renaming

1413
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,439
capability

1414
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,079
although i completely agree with dave's

1415
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:17,119
observation that

1416
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,559
uh uh that in the modern world

1417
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,880
for for both the reasons he's identified

1418
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,599
and another and other sets of reasons

1419
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,280
that we may not see this very often

1420
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,599
but but when we've got something which

1421
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,880
is

1422
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:34,799
at a boundary into a

1423
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,839
different kind of environment even if

1424
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:42,720
it's using smtp on both sides

1425
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,720
um for that to

1426
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:51,359
expand things really may be a

1427
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:54,558
uh nmta function um

1428
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:56,400
a handy example or his peculiar handling

1429
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,839
postman of postmaster in some

1430
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,000
environments

1431
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,440
uh which has always been an odd special

1432
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,359
case and will

1433
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,280
continue to be one until we eliminate

1434
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:08,640
that requirement which

1435
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:12,079
de facto is gone in many places

1436
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,839
uh so again i'm

1437
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,640
reluctant to make changes have some

1438
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:16,640
compelling need

1439
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,599
right uh quickly i think we might be

1440
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,119
shut down anytime now because we have

1441
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:30,559
passed five minutes past

1442
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,559
the the end of it um so ned was saying

1443
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,039
except that it isn't i think in response

1444
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,720
to dave that just isn't how things work

1445
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:39,839
he posted on the mailing list so let's

1446
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,839
take this to the main invest

1447
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:46,240
thank you everyone for coming and

1448
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:50,319
staying so late or so early i know the

1449
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:53,680
time is not ideal this time but uh

1450
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:53,680
thank you for participating

1451
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,680
and we'll see you online and we might

1452
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,160
even have an interim

1453
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:00,160
very soon

1454
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,319
but we haven't discussed this between

1455
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:09,440
chairs and ideas yet so well

1456
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,440
will the meaningless now

1457
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:19,839
thank you everyone
