00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,680
into slide mode or something

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
all right let's see here are people

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
seeing the

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,879
present

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,280
uh well looks like you're not even in

44
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
slide view at all

45
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,680
we see the edit

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:24,159
page huh

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:28,239
it's got all the previews on the left

48
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,239
is that better nope

49
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,280
it will be okay this way but it's just a

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,319
little small

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,599
okay um yeah let me just take it out of

52
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,159
that mode i think we'll just go with

53
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,040
this

54
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,040
for the moment okay

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,959
there you go that'll work

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:52,399
okay so uh note well

57
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,360
um i think uh

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,200
most people are familiar with this um

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
this has to do with our ipr

60
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,839
uh policies our code of conduct um

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,439
our working group processes and

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,360

as soon as i can we have ourselves an

69
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,919
agenda today

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,240
um so before we go through that just

71
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,799
to reintroduce myself and my co-chair um

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,320
you are in the rfc editor future program

73
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,680
um my name is elliott lear

74
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,199
i'm the co-chair of this program

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,840
my co-chair is brian rosen um

76
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,240
and he is also visible to you hopefully

77
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,280
um the program is looking at how we

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,440
involve the function of the rfc editor

79
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,638
we've had a few interim meetings and

80
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,840
we've had one

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,840
we met also at the last virtual ietf

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,080
we are going to cover today based on the

83
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,719
previously published agenda on several

84
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
issues

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,639
i don't know if we'll get through them

86
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,159
all

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,080
the slides that you're looking at are

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
online i've touched them up ever so

89
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,680
slightly

90
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,039
and i'll point out the differences as we

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,479
go through

92
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
um so our agenda for today is to go

93
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,599
through the

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,160
note well which we did to bash this

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,440
agenda

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,800
which we are to review the issues as

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,000
many as we can

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,680
that are listed there um and to see how

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,039
far we can get

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
the chairs would like to have a brief

101
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,440
discussion about um well what happens

102
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,240
once we resolve issues how do we

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,919
record those results and we think

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
probably the best way to go about that

105
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,318
is to

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:05,039
have a draft that is based on the rough

107
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,039
consensus

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
we want to talk a little bit at the end

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
about meeting timing and operating

110
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,800
methods

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,919
and then any other business um

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,039
but before we proceed uh as is

113
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,080
um traditional uh this is clearly your

114
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
opportunity to bash

115
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,360
and i want to thank

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,479
rich sauls who's agreed to take minutes

117
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
for us

118
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,960
may i ask for a volunteer

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
um in the group to just keep an eye on

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,159
jabber such as when it becomes

121
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,120
functional again

122
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,400
um that that if somebody wants to call

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,759
out anything that is seen

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
in jabber they can in terms of if people

125
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,880
need

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,198
access to the microphone and i have a

127
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960

134
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,520
okay great okay very good reload you

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
need to reload if you want to be able to

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
get the jabber back

137
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,560
working within your um window though

138
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,599
okay

139
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960

140
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,800
javascript

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
reload echo if you want to get that up

142
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
and working as far as i understand

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,479
it okay um i think from a chair's

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,880
perspective

145
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,719
maybe i i stay on and brian if you want

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,560
to reload great if you don't know what

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,440
i'm going to do

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
i'll even come right back okay and will

149
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
people please forgive me

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,960
if if they if they don't um

151
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,319
if i don't respond to something in

152
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,599
jabber it's because at the moment i

153
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,840
can't see it

154
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,520
um the chairs has had somewhat agreed

155
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,119
that that i'd probably run the show

156
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
because it's middle of the day my time

157
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,560
in the middle of the night

158
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,960
brian's time but

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,960
just a byway of process the way we had

160
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,560
discussed moving forward at this point

161
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,878
was that we were going to sort of tackle

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
issue by issue

163
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
that uh we would um raise issues on the

164
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,639
mailing list but discuss them

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,160
on in meetings um we'll come back to

166
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
a little bit of the methodology see if

167
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,879
we can evolve that just slightly

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,440
uh towards the end of the meeting but

169
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,440
this is how we agreed we would operate

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,760
um at least in this meeting um

171
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,599
and then uh you know we'll we'll try and

172
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
know how far we can get in this meeting

173
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,519
on the issues that are open

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,479
any comments or questions before we move

175
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,479
forward to the issues

176
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,440
and welcome back brian

177
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,479
okay work with the restart

178
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,000
okay then um we'll start

179
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,720
um the issue tracker uh is available

180
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
to people you can see the issues um in

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,959
github

182
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
um that's that's been posted to the

183
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,518
mailing list as has been a summary of

184
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,120
each of the issues that

185
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,600
are open the chairs did do a little bit

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
of documentary work on the issues just

187
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
to indicate whether they were in

188
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
discussion

189
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,240
whether they're pending discussion or

190
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
whether we think we're deferring them

191
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
until

192
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,040
later if any issue can be discussed of

193
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,959
course

194
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
right this is just our observation and

195
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
perhaps a little bit of a recommendation

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,680
from the chairs there are a few things

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,040
that it seemed to make sense to defer

198
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,439
till later

199
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,880
but uh obviously the working group

200
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
participants can raise

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,279
uh any point that they wish to raise

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
right this is just a matter of

203
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,200
trying to organize a little bit about

204
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,880
how we're discussing today but

205
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,200
you know you're free to discuss what you

206
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,439
want to discuss

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,080
um so moving then to issue 10.

208
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,760
so uh let's see here why didn't we in

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,200
fact move tuition there it is

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
okay so the the this issue um

211
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,959
the chairs don't think we have to spend

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
a huge amount of time on this today

213
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,640
and i'll explain why um but but of

214
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,719
course the

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,160
working group and this is how we operate

216
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
is as a working group even though we're

217
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,240
an id

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
program um

219
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,640
there seem to be a a general feel

220
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
that people learning thinks there needs

221
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,760
to be a body

222
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,560
um but we're not prepared to call

223
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,000
consensus on this point yet and the

224
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,839
reason we're not

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
is that uh some people have raised

226
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
concerns they said they really want to

227
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
see

228
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,120
exactly how the position is going to

229
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,439
fill out

230
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,120
before they they they pass judgment um

231
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,440
in particular i don't know if ecker's on

232
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
the call but i think that was really the

233
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,800
the crux of ecker's point and i think

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,240
one other person made that point as well

235
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,160
um and we want to respect that position

236
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,640
but before i go any further

237
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,120
i do see that i would invite echo if i

238
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,680
miss on if i'm mistaken what you

239
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
your position um if you want to comment

240
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,599
or if other people want to comment

241
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
we think this one is probably you know

242
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
exactly whether or not we

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
we have a role i think people feel like

244
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
they need to see what it is in order to

245
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,600
make that decision in the end

246
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,200
does anybody feel the need to disagree

247
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,120
with with that characterization

248
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,440
hector would you want to want to talk

249
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,120
i think that's roughly accurate oh i

250
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
think it's i think it's roughly accurate

251
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,079
characterization of my of my position

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,599
i'm not sure that i agree the

253
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,120
characterization of the uh

254
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,800
of the um overall uh demographics of the

255
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,920
positions

256
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,959
okay that's fair um

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,240
the other point we want to highlight

258
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,959
as part of this is um we do think there

259
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,000
was

260
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,439
a very strong consensus that nobody

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,279
likes the term thought leader at the

262
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
moment nor did

263
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
did and a few people had said that it

264
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,479
probably should be deferred in terms of

265
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,120
what the term is

266
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
and that got linked to a bunch of other

267
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,880
issues

268
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,638
as well um and so

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,240
um i think we have to talk about what

270
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
the term is and it will come up in a

271
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,320
little bit

272
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,800
but um uh for the moment

273
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
let we're gonna put thought leader aside

274
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,359
right and

275
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
and say we're not gonna use that term at

276
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,880
least for the moment

277
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
we might come back to it later i don't

278
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
know

279
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,079
but we're not going to use that term for

280
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,720
the moment to describe this person

281
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,638
and um we know that we have a separate

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
issue we have issue 24 that's opened on

283
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,519
this

284
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
and um exactly how that works is tied

285
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
directly to

286
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,719
issue 12 which talks about advisor or

287
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
leader so

288
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,560
we think all of this we want to just

289
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,680
push along until

290
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,359
into the next coming issues does anybody

291
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,638
want to comment further on issue 10

292
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,000
before we do

293
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,000
you know go in that direction

294
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,800
okay seeing no comments we're going to

295
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
press on to issue 11.

296
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,560
so issue 11 says if there is a

297
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
figurehead

298
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,399
is this person a paid expert in in

299
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,239
technic in technical publishing and we

300
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,160
split that out is the person paid and

301
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
the reason we did that was that early on

302
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
in the discussions there was some

303
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,720
question as to whether anybody should be

304
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,560
paid for this

305
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,639
and does the person have technical

306
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,560
experience and a technical expertise in

307
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,800
in publishing so we think

308
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,760
if there is a person at all we think

309
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
that

310
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,360
um we have we believe we have

311
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,639
general consensus that the person will

312
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,519
be paid

313
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,360
um but this is our view and this is what

314
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,839
we we perceive

315
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,240
um but we would like to open this up for

316
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,800
conversation if people feel like

317
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,720
they don't agree with with the view and

318
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,199
again it's only if we have someone if we

319
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
don't

320
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,639
if we don't have anybody then um

321
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:17,839
who's taking this role then this issue

322
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:17,839
doesn't apply

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,599
right okay so i think we're going to

324
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,719
leave it at that we'll confirm that on

325
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,320
the list based on

326
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
you know as it relates to other issues

327
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
and if you look at the summary that i

328
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,639
have

329
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,560
uh yes hello let's use that eric

330
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
oh eric yes please go ahead eric sorry i

331
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,160
missed you there go on

332
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
yeah this seems like a very odd way to

333
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,680
proceed i don't understand how we can

334
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,839
given that we have no job description

335
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
um and no consistency we need this

336
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,480
person the idea that somehow we decide

337
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,120
that if we need a person with an

338
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
unspecified

339
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,760
description they ought to be paid and

340
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,639
that would be a terrible publishing so

341
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,319
it's really odd

342
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,399
like they maybe they'd be an expert i

343
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,959
don't know um you know taxidermy

344
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,160
so like like i mean like i understand

345
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,518
you're trying to close issues but like

346
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,079
really we actually have to like

347
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
address the main issue of like what it

348
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
is we're trying to think this person

349
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,279
ought to do

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
rather than trying to like find

351
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
peripheral issues that you think your

352
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,639
consensus on

353
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,199
conditional on like some you know on

354
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,000
something unspecified thing

355
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,279
so um just to highlight where we're

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,199
going maybe the thing

357
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,600
you're saying is you know the the key

358
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,959
issue right that i think we're aiming to

359
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,959
to aim at is sort of issue 12

360
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,119
right which is what is this you know the

361
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,279
issue 12 sort of aims at exactly that

362
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
but people prefer that we go right there

363
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,959
and then skip issue 12

364
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
11 for the moment

365
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,279
did you fight either go ahead mike oh

366
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
sorry

367
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:55,839
mike you you're uh muted

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
can you hear me now yeah there you go

369
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,360
okay sorry

370
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
my it suddenly decided i needed to

371
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,759
re-authorize

372
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
the microphone um i i entered this into

373
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,759
the

374
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,519
into the chat but basically there are

375
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
unlike what eric said there are

376
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,839
documents that describe

377
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,040
you know the role of quote unquote a

378
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,399
figurehead or

379
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
the rsc editor if we don't go in that

380
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,800
direction

381
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,639
then we have to look at each one of the

382
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,758
roles that are already defined

383
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:36,959
responses are already defined and either

384
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,320
say those aren't necessary anymore or

385
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,920
move them to the collective group or

386
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,199
to another contract of some flavor so

387
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,120
don't i i don't hand wave that there's

388
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,800
no job description there is

389
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,399
that we're trying to figure out if we're

390
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,359
going to

391
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,560
get rid of the job and distribute the

392
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,560
responsibility somewhere else

393
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,439
i think eric is saying and and i mean

394
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
obviously eric can speak for himself

395
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
but i think he's saying well wait a

396
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,280
minute aren't we here to to review

397
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
whether

398
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:18,160
what the dob description is would that

399
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:21,599
be fair eric

400
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,319
eric go ahead sorry it just takes a

401
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,879
while to mute

402
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,438
yes that is in fact what i am saying

403
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559
okay

404
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,919
yeah so uh you know i i i take eric's

405
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,840
point um

406
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,840
and uh bernie go ahead

407
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,120
yeah found on you what now yeah

408
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,840
me spit uncle like pain is a white term

409
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,280
like i

410
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,918
mean that to be paid by the ietf

411
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,799
llc or should be like some sponsored

412
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,840
position by

413
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,840
uh participating company as

414
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,360
many of the roles now how is this like

415
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,159
thought so far

416
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,879
yeah something that says that's llc it's

417
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,559
going to be

418
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,600
a contract with the llc yeah

419
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:14,720
so um

420
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,480
i again i do think that there was a

421
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,919
general view

422
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,640
that people felt we needed someone uh

423
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,520
the exact job description though i think

424
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,080
i want to

425
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,520
recognize ecker's point as well like it

426
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,879
helps to understand

427
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
you know what the person needs to do to

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,640
determine whether or not the work needs

429
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,960
to be done

430
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,080
um so we've had some discussion on the

431
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,360
list though about that

432
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,240
in terms of what that person's doing

433
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,320
um and maybe between these two issues

434
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,080
right between 11 and 12

435
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,799
we really should be discussing that

436
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,840
right if we looked at the note that

437
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,520
um sandy sent if we look at

438
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,039
uh some of the discussion that we've

439
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,679
seen from the rtc

440
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,879
in terms of what what they what what

441
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,320
they've been tracking

442
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,480
um if we look at what brian has proposed

443
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
um i think between those three things we

444
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
get sort of

445
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,039
towards the general direction of a uh

446
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,480
a job description and um

447
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,960
if if i may right if we go

448
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
if we go past just that if we go into

449
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,440
issues well right here's

450
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,400
here's what brian sent right

451
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,640
which is um you know it's slightly

452
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,799
modified and it's slightly modified beta

453
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
based on a later message from brian

454
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,039
right as to whether we call this person

455
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,320
an advisor or an editor or what we call

456
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,360
him

457
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,159
or her um and

458
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,918
um you'll see that the chairs have tried

459
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,720
to highlight

460
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,520
we think are some of the key points of

461
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
contention

462
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,320
in what that goal might be

463
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,760
right and so maybe spending the time

464
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,600
here is is worth it and then backing up

465
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
and looking at looking at this is part

466
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,840
of issue 12 right

467
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,240
and look at look at this and see if we

468
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,439
can have the discussion about

469
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,600
this text here and hopefully maybe that

470
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,360
will help inform your answers

471
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,559
to both issue 11 issue 24 what we call

472
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,360
the person

473
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,960
right and and in fact issue 10 what what

474
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,439
person we have

475
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,640
right so maybe the thing to do is to

476
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,520
invite commentary

477
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,559
and discussion right here on this text

478
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,918
here

479
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,720
okay we had some discussion on the list

480
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,120
um

481
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,880
people have raised concerns about

482
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,039
ability to hire if the

483
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,919
if the um text is if the position

484
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,520
sounds weak um people have raised

485
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,080
concerns about whether

486
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,520
uh this person would be able to

487
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,918
affirmatively bring things

488
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,960
to the uh to the the um

489
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,280
uh to the group

490
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,679
and and for for discussion when they

491
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,799
when they see problems

492
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:17,840
so i guess my question is

493
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:17,840
what do people think of this text

494
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,840
you got any comments on the text there

495
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,840
we go

496
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
mike mike

497
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
and just to say i might put you i might

498
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,400
do some live editing

499
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,559
if people have suggestions to um

500
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,480
you know to improve text or to make

501
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,240
changes maybe in brackets or something

502
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,600
like that as another organization might

503
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,720
do

504
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,480
go ahead mike all right um i'm kind of

505
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
amused at the text because it's

506
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
pretty similar to what i wrote in the

507
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,960
original draft

508
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,799
the draft that i did with respect to

509
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,840
their sort of the split between

510
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,039
um the professional person and

511
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,039
whatever body is is related to that

512
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,240
so i don't have i don't have a lot of

513
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,840
problems with this i think it

514
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,559
has more to do with sort of the the

515
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,120
split of responsibilities between person

516
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,520
and

517
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,239
whatever that group is and i noticed in

518
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,879
a later

519
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
slide you're basically open versus

520
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,600
closed group

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,320
and that i have the suspicion that's

522
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,918
going to throw back into this space once

523
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:41,840
we get to it

524
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:41,840
possibly thanks mark

525
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,760
so i'm reading this in isolation because

526
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,320
there's been a

527
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,720
lot of water under the bridge um it

528
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,399
seems like this is saying that the rsc

529
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:02,159
excuse me the rc role is

530
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,200
a facilitator um

531
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:07,360
of a working group and so

532
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
we know what a working group is we know

533
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,879
how that works

534
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
i'm not sure what a facilitator of a

535
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
working group is

536
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,520
in terms of do they call consensus do

537
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,320
you appeal their decision i don't know

538
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
and i think we really need to be really

539
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,559
crisp about the nature of this role

540
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,120
and and the other thing i would note

541
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:30,480
here is is that we are conflating

542
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:33,600
whatever facilitating is bd

543
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,880
and expertise so you know one function

544
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,879
of this person

545
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,919
which some people the community believe

546
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,840
is very important

547
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,400
and others maybe don't but that aside

548
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,439
uh one function of this person is to be

549
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
a senior professional with deep

550
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
knowledge of technical publishing

551
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,000
to serve as a resource to advise us in

552
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,000
in in publishing the rfc series

553
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,840
fine um so conflating that

554
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,840
with this facilitating role especially

555
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,959
if the facilitating role

556
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,639
is has the effect of being a chair makes

557
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,679
me kind of nervous

558
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,720
um you know we don't have expertise

559
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,440
experts come in

560
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,120
uh that we use as resources like that

561
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
and also

562
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,399
driving consensus and and coming up with

563
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
meeting agendas and

564
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,400
having that level of ownership of of of

565
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,959
the process

566
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,480
so that's something that you know to my

567
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,880
eye we should pick apart a little bit

568
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,279
and

569
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
at least examine that relationship yes

570
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,039
um stay on

571
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
stay on for just a moment um just uh

572
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,200
my mistake i should have said this

573
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,279
earlier um the red is the things that i

574
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,039
think we don't have consensus on

575
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,480
and i think you've touched on the exact

576
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,360
reason as to

577
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,159
why we wouldn't have consensus on them

578
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,158
actually so

579
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,279
uh my apologies for not for not stating

580
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,279
that earlier

581
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,080
um so you're exactly right here you know

582
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,360
sure so um we're now exploring the pink

583
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,960
time between australia and

584
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,959
uh and switzerland so fantastic

585
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,080
also it says here you know i said it

586
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,760
kind of it could be a chair roll but the

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,678
way we're interpreting this text is

588
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,279
the rsc expected to ensure that rsaw

589
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,799
consensus is well documented and

590
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,159
communicated to the community the lfc

591
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,559
and the rep

592
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
that almost sounds like a secretary role

593
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,600
so i'm i'm even more confused about what

594
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,639
this thing is

595
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,158
right so exactly so the

596
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:27,760
the these are the points i think that um

597
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:30,080
we we see as as contentious

598
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,799
let me ask you a different question

599
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,720
which is the text in black

600
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,559
um if you were to sort of you know

601
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,480
add a filter add a red filter to this

602
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,000
right so you didn't see the red text

603
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,480
would you be otherwise comfortable with

604
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,480
what you see

605
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,240
i think there's still question i don't

606
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,279
have strong feelings about it but i

607
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,200
think there's still questions

608
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,320
in in the community about whether we

609
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,520
need a senior professional deep

610
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,879
knowledge of technical publishing but

611
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,279
let's

612
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
let's say that we do um i think there's

613
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,480
also a question of whether that needs to

614
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,360
be a full-time position or or

615
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
on-call or whatever um so i question

616
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,639
that part of it

617
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,240
uh the next paragraph operate by

618
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,440
providing expert advice to the art

619
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,279
well that would be the function if we

620
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,039
had an expert of some sort yes

621
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,400
and if requested rpc yes that makes

622
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,760
sense uh

623
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,840
the rca will be talking about proposed

624
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,240
changes top guide rc for anyone yeah

625
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,000
that so that second paragraph after the

626
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,640
role the rfc editor is very reasonable

627
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,840
i think we need you know we we arguably

628
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
need someone to provide that kind of

629
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,559
advice in some fashion

630
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,919
sure i question the name rfc editors

631
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,080
series editor but that's i think a

632
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,240
different issue already uh there's

633
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,240
expected to attend all meetings

634
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,240
i guess there's a question there about

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,320
whether it's an ongoing you know

636
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,559
they are involved in all discussions or

637
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,360
it's just an on-call basis

638
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,240
um participate in online discussions

639
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,639
yeah

640
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,159
maybe then they're expected to be active

641
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
and proposed improvements to the rfc

642
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
series developing vision of policy

643
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,719
documents establishing community

644
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,879
consensus for them

645
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,320
um expect to be active in proposing

646
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,159
improvements to rfc series

647
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,039
fine um if if we want our expert to be

648
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,320
proactive that's one way to spell this

649
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,600
um i think we should make a conscious

650
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,918
decision as to whether they're

651
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,360
proactive or we just consult them uh

652
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,080
that in developing vision and policy

653
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
documents

654
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,360
that is the strategy role and i don't

655
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,158
think we come to consensus about where

656
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,279
the strategy

657
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,520
role sits i i don't think

658
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,880
that seems to be giving the rsc

659
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,960
ownership of what i was

660
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,919
starting to understand the rsawg is as

661
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,000
zoning

662
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,120
so i think that needs to be picked apart

663
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
and then establishing community

664
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,000
consensus for them well that comes back

665
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,600
to the question of whether or not

666
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,679
this person is a chair or not okay

667
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,799
so yeah that last paragraph is

668
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,840
problematic

669
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,279
okay so um

670
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,279
good thank first of all thank you very

671
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,880
much uh for your comments i think

672
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,480
you did a really good job at

673
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,960
articulating um

674
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,240
if you will that the issues so thank you

675
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,880
for that

676
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,080
before i go further on my thoughts let's

677
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,760
go through the queue a bit

678
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,760
okay yeah martin is next go ahead

679
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,879
yes mark basically covered almost

680
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,039
everything that i was going to

681
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,480
point out here i i think that there's

682
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
there's a real risk when you

683
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,159
when you pay someone to do a job that's

684
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,559
specifically focused in an area

685
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,760
that they end up dominating discussion

686
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,320
in a particular

687
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,360
group like this and that's probably okay

688
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,960
to a certain extent

689
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
if um if you think of this person as

690
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,840
being active and actively contributing

691
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,279
to the to the discussion but

692
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,760
um when you have things like

693
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,000
establishing community consensus and

694
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
and being responsible for documents and

695
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and the implication that perhaps

696
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,080
maybe they're a chair or have some sort

697
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
of official standing in

698
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,639
in this group that really gets a little

699
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,320
little muddy so i'm kind of with mark on

700
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,480
this one if you strike all the red

701
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,439
and you still have to deal with that

702
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,720
last

703
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,080
um last paragraph i would i would

704
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,520
probably say that uh attendance and

705
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,918
participation would be

706
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,760
enough if if that's what you were

707
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,520
looking for you could almost completely

708
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,879
strike that that final paragraph

709
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,679
assuming all the other things that we're

710
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,640
talking about here are

711
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,320
settled and i'm i still have questions

712
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
myself

713
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,639
thanks

714
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
john

715
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,080
yeah first of all i uh

716
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,520
well what what while i like the general

717
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,439
organization of this

718
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,720
and that probably matches mike's

719
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,320
comments

720
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,520
i i certainly agree with uh with market

721
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,480
with martin that this

722
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,039
text as it's reading is uh is papering

723
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,159
over a

724
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,360
whole series of issues about which i

725
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,320
don't think we have agreement and uh and

726
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,600
listening to mark

727
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,399
and martin in the last few moments uh

728
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,480
leads me to believe that we still have

729
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,120
very very fundamental conflicts about

730
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,000
what this

731
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,239
uh this whole business is about maybe

732
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,440
maybe not just this role but the whole

733
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,440
rfc editor function and uh and we've

734
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
made no progress on that since

735
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,960
uh since back when um

736
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,960
the thing i would add to those comments

737
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,840
is that uh

738
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,880
as i've said on the list i'm still

739
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,678
concerned

740
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,799
not only whether the so-called working

741
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,279
group is open or

742
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,120
closed but whether there's enough

743
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,240
expertise there

744
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,799
to actually make that a uh

745
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
a decision-making body and if the

746
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,879
expertise

747
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,158
isn't there uh then a

748
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,799
very important part of the of the role

749
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:55,039
of the whatever if there's a whatever

750
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,960
uh becomes to uh uh to educate that

751
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,399
group on things which

752
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,960
given other things we've seen in the

753
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,199
ietf over in recent years

754
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,159
that group unless carefully selected may

755
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,720
not be interested

756
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,919
being educated about so again i think

757
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,120
there's a lot i

758
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,559
think there's a lot here that we uh

759
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,799
have less consensus about even

760
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,158
the black areas than this text would

761
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,519
seem to imply

762
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,279
and in that respect that i completely

763
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,279
agree with mark thank you

764
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,080
ecker um i found myself in the position

765
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,120
of agreeing with

766
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,559
john mark and martin um uh

767
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,559
i think i think john did a much better

768
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,080
job frankly of summarizing um what i was

769
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,039
sort of complaining about earlier

770
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,320
um uh than i did which is like we have

771
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,279
fundamental disagreements about how this

772
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
thing should be structured

773
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,320
and to sort of be like hey we can just

774
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,960
like words with the text so everybody's

775
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,879
happy

776
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,799
and like try to like that's just not

777
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,799
gonna work so we actually need to like

778
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,120
like either like like throw up our hands

779
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,039
and give up or like actually try to

780
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,799
just discuss those fundamental issues

781
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,120
not be like hey we can just like issue

782
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,639
track our way into this being done um

783
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,959
and um

784
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,200
to to that end let me actually suggest a

785
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
a a piece of title that might be useful

786
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,960
which is to separate out the topic of

787
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,279
um managing the tooling and the

788
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,480
technology for the topic of managing

789
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:21,840
the um the sort of uh

790
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,000
uh style and um i think

791
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,959
maybe extra interfacing stuff like by

792
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,200
which i mean like

793
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,720
um uh you know libraries and those kinds

794
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,960
of things um

795
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,559
uh i mean we make a very real need like

796
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,240
in the fashion relatively short term to

797
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,639
make sure that like the you know

798
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,000
that the tooling um is like properly

799
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,159
hitched um

800
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,080
and um and and and that is actually a

801
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,799
lot of designer tactical um some of the

802
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,158
strategic

803
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,600
um and um uh uh and and

804
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,720
yet and then we also have long-term

805
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,279
questions i think that perhaps people

806
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,320
think of

807
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,600
um that are more more about um i i don't

808
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,240
use that editorial but more about

809
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,559
content

810
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,840
um and so perhaps you could discuss

811
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,840
separately how we think of those things

812
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,639
okay i'm not quite sure i fully

813
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,519
understood

814
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,679
the split that you were proposing so so

815
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,120
stick around for a sec okay

816
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,279
um sure it may be incoherent too yeah

817
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,799
it's it's with the hours right let me

818
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,200
make a couple of comments

819
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,240
right first of all the very next issue

820
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
talks about

821
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,600
what you know the structure of the group

822
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,720
that governs strategy

823
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,959
right so it's that you know

824
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,240
we have this issue right in this group

825
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,039
we've tried to put together

826
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,679
sort of you know we tried to put

827
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,960
together a couple different

828
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,480
proposals right i'm very grateful to the

829
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,799
authors who did that

830
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,320
right to see if we had a starting point

831
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,720
and people said well wait a minute

832
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,879
really we don't want to use these drafts

833
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,159
as a starting point we want to we really

834
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,559
need to go through the

835
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,360
core issues before we start writing

836
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,080
drafts so

837
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,639
we tried to do that right and that's

838
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,158
where we

839
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,159
you know landed in discussions

840
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,600
um the ordering of the issues is always

841
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
tricky because what's your

842
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,960
what you know some people view the

843
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,800
something as the cart and other people

844
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,639
view it as the horse

845
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,919
um so i asked the group for a little bit

846
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,000
of leeway on that

847
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,239
right to say okay we're going to cover

848
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,918
we are covering some core issues today

849
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,638
all right what is the role of the r

850
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,918
seater what is the role

851
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,720
of the committee that's going to handle

852
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,839
um strategy right how or how is it

853
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,638
constructed

854
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,599
right these are probably the the two key

855
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,399
issues

856
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,320
that i think people are fundamentally

857
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,199
expressing concern on

858
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,639
so now you eric have said that you would

859
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,078
like to split

860
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,320
out um sort of the the tooling

861
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,679
from other aspects but i i'm sure i'm

862
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
butchering this so

863
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
can you go can you go through a little

864
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,280
bit on that

865
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,040
well i can try um again again i'm going

866
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,440
to be told this is incoherent

867
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,640
um i guess what i'm trying to say is

868
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,040
that we have

869
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,680
like we have like an immediate need we

870
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
have like

871
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,118
like so it's like you know we got along

872
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,599
for like a really long time with like

873
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,040
you know

874
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,320
um uh with a set of arrangements

875
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,800
that were semi-static um and you know

876
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,839
um and whatever one thinks of you know

877
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,640
um

878
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,920
of of you know that like and we get

879
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,640
along for like a while without the style

880
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
guide changing

881
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,680
we get along for a while without like

882
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,359
doing more work with libraries or

883
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,799
whatever um whether when things are

884
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,240
important or not like we get a lot

885
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,760
longer for a while that goes but like

886
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,399
right now like the tool chain is kind of

887
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
in a mess

888
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,000
and we actually need someone to fix the

889
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,760
tool chain and so um

890
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
and that's like actually really urgent

891
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,280
like i don't need like you know we could

892
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,520
like

893
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,720
i guess we could be like hey john like

894
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,400
john levine could just like sit on this

895
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,480
for like a long time at a time

896
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,440
um but like you know it'd be nice to

897
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,119
have like a community structure

898
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,599
understood that it's what i'm saying is

899
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
like and i think that's like a non-pro

900
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
not only a matter of tactical procedure

901
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,160
but also like a not on principle

902
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,240
distinction between like the software

903
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,598
and like you know the circuit content

904
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,799
matters and so

905
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,640
i'm suggesting that perhaps we could

906
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,920
come to some agreement on how how the

907
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,759
software would be handled

908
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,680
and that leads to some form of progress

909
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,480
and then and then the content matters

910
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,960
especially got a different form of

911
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,960
agreement

912
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,839
okay sure because do you view

913
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,040
do you view this would you want that

914
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,078
this person

915
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,320
right to be active in the tooling

916
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,960
development tooling specification

917
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,599
none of the above how how do how do you

918
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
you know

919
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,599
how how would you want that to proceed

920
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
um well i guess i guess you say this

921
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
person but i'm not sure like i'm not

922
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,680
sure i believe that but um you know

923
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,640
um but like i guess what i'm saying is

924
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,000
we have like a we have like like i i i

925
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,879
like to start from needs rather than

926
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,960
from like structure

927
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,720
and what i'm saying is the need we have

928
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,520
is for like a relatively fast tactical

929
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,759
mech structure

930
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,280
for like dealing with um you know

931
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,160
dealing with our like

932
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,520
not optimal pulling structure and um and

933
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
that is i'm like i'm like well it can't

934
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
be the case

935
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,040
like all that has to like like every

936
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,399
decision about that has to go back to

937
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,320
the working questions

938
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,680
right and so and so we need something we

939
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,240
need some structure to link to that and

940
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
i'm saying

941
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,200
like maybe we could agree we could all

942
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,240
agree on that point and talk about how

943
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,839
that would be managed

944
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:22,879
um um but maybe not

945
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,119
yeah okay let's go on um

946
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,560
okay i guess the queue is empty actually

947
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,680
okay so

948
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,520
um i think

949
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,879
what i i'm sorry so i think i'm in the

950
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,759
queue but you probably can't see me

951
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,640
because oh sorry that's just gone

952
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,680
yeah sorry about that um so i'm

953
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,759
listening to all this and i've been

954
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,520
trying to follow the discussion too

955
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,680
and you know i i think that this group

956
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,200
has made really good progress in the

957
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,560
beginning but i'm i'm sort of getting

958
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,919
concerned about the level of spinning

959
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,279
that's gone on in the last you know a

960
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,240
couple of months for good reason right

961
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,839
you know we were actually finally

962
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,319
getting the points of

963
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,240
as some people put it today these are

964
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
the fundamental places that we disagree

965
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,439
about

966
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,439
and you know i think some of what i'm

967
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,720
hearing is a lot of discussion around

968
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,720
sort of the trying to define the

969
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,399
nebulous roles um

970
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,319
and i started writing down you know

971
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,079
maybe we could talk about some concrete

972
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,880
scenarios right here is a here's a

973
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,200
scenario

974
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,359
and then right as i was typing that eric

975
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
piped up with actively fixed the toolkit

976
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,960
right it was a concrete scenario

977
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,960
and i i kind of agree with ecker that

978
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,839
that was sort of a possibly a good way

979
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,880
to go where

980
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,320
maybe if you you know thought of what is

981
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,880
the role of this person

982
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
in this specific situation it will allow

983
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,760
you to sort of

984
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
you know come from the other direction

985
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,599
to extrapolate upward into what the

986
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,760
larger role might be

987
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,040
i'm brainstorming out loud trying to

988
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,960
figure out you know

989
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,720
how can we get beyond the stumbling

990
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,000
block that we're on right now

991
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,720
thanks yeah that sort of

992
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,440
and indeed was that was where my

993
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,359
question was

994
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,960
uh aiming right which is okay we have

995
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,000
the need how do we

996
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,680
how do we resolve it in in a context

997
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,200
that uh in in this context

998
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,720
so i'm all for that um

999
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,040
i'm not sure we can do it live it may be

1000
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,040
a bit too much to ask with people but it

1001
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,160
sounds like a good example to to flesh

1002
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,680
out

1003
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,680
if you will um

1004
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,760
all right i don't think you're right

1005
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,759
it's too late

1006
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,280
what do people think i mean the the

1007
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,760
tooling you know there's

1008
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,680
there's clearly uh a bunch of discussion

1009
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,960
right now about the tooling

1010
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,799
um and uh there was a you know

1011
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,119
a big deal about tooling a little while

1012
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,440
ago as i recall

1013
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,960
so what do we want this person's role to

1014
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
be in handling the tooling

1015
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,240
we agree they're a domain expert in

1016
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,200
publishing and we agree that they're not

1017
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,560
necessarily an ietf expert although we

1018
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,480
vary about how much i

1019
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,560
have expertise they need but

1020
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,079
what do you believe their role should be

1021
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,640
in in

1022
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,480
in in working with tooling yeah and let

1023
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,400
me just add a

1024
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,920
a scope question let's leave this to the

1025
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,480
scope of rfcs

1026
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,839
and and document uh publishing right

1027
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,359
let's not try and

1028
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:21,839
talk about every tooling aspect of the

1029
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,839
itf

1030
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,040
sure joel is on thecube

1031
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,640
just ruled out what i was going to to

1032
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,000
point out

1033
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,078
problem with your question is it assumes

1034
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,280
an agreement on something which we don't

1035
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,319
agree on

1036
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,480
if we assume as i would like to

1037
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,599
we want to continue rfcs the way they

1038
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,200
are

1039
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,880
then figuring out exactly how to get the

1040
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,439
tooling to work

1041
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,560
might well be something we could put on

1042
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,640
we could just ask rob

1043
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,680
give robert enough apparently to figure

1044
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,879
out

1045
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,960
for example but and not

1046
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,520
burden the rfc editor with it but

1047
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,960
that's because that really becomes if we

1048
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,720
assume the agreement the software

1049
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,400
development

1050
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,549
but if we don't assume that agreement

1051
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,579
then the question is not even meaningful

1052
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:16,579
[Music]

1053
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,240
martin

1054
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,399
i think charles hit on something that's

1055
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,359
pretty reasonable here and in fact

1056
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,760
i was going to suggest exactly that that

1057
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:31,200
um

1058
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,960
we can leave this to robert um

1059
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,078
for for the most part unless and until

1060
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,400
the uh whatever body whatever

1061
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,839
individual comes up with strategy has

1062
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,680
some tooling requirements that need

1063
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,759
negotiation and even at that point i

1064
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,078
would suggest that this is an llc

1065
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,680
responsibility that could be discharged

1066
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,359
by the llc entirely

1067
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,960
and i think that's what my draft said

1068
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,040
that was specifically a carve out for

1069
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,280
tooling

1070
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,960
if if the requirements are sufficiently

1071
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,760
complex that we think it needs

1072
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,520
interaction then i don't see why this

1073
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,040
person would not be engaged in that

1074
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,480
process perhaps but

1075
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,920
that would not be a primary

1076
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,920
responsibility i don't think

1077
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,240
okay um so

1078
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,880
i guess what i've heard is that um

1079
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,560
maybe if we were to look at at tooling

1080
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,480
right

1081
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,839
there the division of labor here might

1082
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,880
be to to

1083
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,640
maybe to lay out certain requirements to

1084
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,800
hand to robert

1085
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,560
right who hands those things to robert

1086
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
is still at issue

1087
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,160
but um and when the what the

1088
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,200
deliverables are

1089
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,240
would be a question that as to who

1090
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,919
who specifies those deliverables um

1091
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,319
but there's probably a general

1092
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,599
requirement that has to be

1093
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,200
um uh expressed from the

1094
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,480
from either the person or the community

1095
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,879
um

1096
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
ecker

1097
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,520
like maybe a couple so i liked west's

1098
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,879
hypotheticals

1099
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,200
idea um and i think me a couple

1100
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,480
hypotheticals were useful um you know

1101
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,640
i think perhaps one i think would be um

1102
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,240
you know given our current state where

1103
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,759
we're effective what we have

1104
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,319
you know we have some we have some

1105
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,319
structure um instead of tooling xml

1106
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:25,359
v3 et cetera um but clearly it needs

1107
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,119
some cleanup

1108
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,400
and so one question we asked how did

1109
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,960
that clean up work and i think what i'm

1110
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,920
hearing

1111
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,280
what i heard uh um you know martin's

1112
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,560
just was like basically let robert sort

1113
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,640
it out and like basically

1114
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,920
like just do take whatever he likes and

1115
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,598
then there's um and

1116
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,599
martin feel free to correct me obviously

1117
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,640
um and then i'm not sure i think about

1118
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,359
that i'm just trying to like lay out the

1119
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,359
space

1120
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,040
um and then i think there's like imagine

1121
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,839
that we like imagine we wanted to do

1122
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,680
markdown

1123
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,359
or there was a desire to do markdown how

1124
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,799
would that decision get made and like

1125
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,560
and like what would that decision and

1126
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,640
then what would the uh and

1127
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,078
and then you know what would be that the

1128
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,200
the project

1129
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,440
of design of defining um you know

1130
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,879
um you know where what the detailed

1131
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,640
design of the other structures

1132
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,160
so i don't know like i mean like the

1133
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,160
people think those are cycles are useful

1134
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,440
um well let's step through that just for

1135
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,680
a moment okay

1136
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,480
all right you could imagine that we have

1137
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,319
this committee

1138
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,839
of some form whether it's you know

1139
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,520
appointed or

1140
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,799
um whether it's a

1141
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,240
a an open committee and

1142
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,920
the committee says you know what we

1143
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,799
really want uh

1144
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,319
the input to be marked down for instance

1145
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,040
or output to be marked whatever the case

1146
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,480
may be

1147
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,720
right uh what level specification

1148
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,640
what level of specificity does the

1149
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,160
community need to decide on this

1150
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,319
who who makes the proposal right and

1151
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,279
who who agrees to the proposal like

1152
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,880
what's the

1153
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,280
you know what's the back and forth that

1154
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
occurs right i think that

1155
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
probably fills out your example a little

1156
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,640
bit right and

1157
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,200
i know other people want to comment on

1158
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:05,040
that right but as i saw

1159
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,799
brian's text right if i if i relate this

1160
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,040
back to what we're looking at

1161
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,160
what the what this person would do would

1162
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,960
be to try

1163
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,160
and bring to the attention to the group

1164
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,839
right

1165
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,759
issues that i either try to bring to

1166
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,240
your attention the issues group

1167
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,119
have or to try and formulate you know

1168
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,720
based on what

1169
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,200
people have brought to the group to work

1170
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,279
with the group to formulate the

1171
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,520
um the requirements in such a way that

1172
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,359
robert could execute or work with robert

1173
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,240
to put together a proposal to bring back

1174
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,200
to the

1175
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,799
to the community does that does that

1176
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,040
seem to take the proposal forward a

1177
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,440
little bit

1178
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,440
colin

1179
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,800
hi can you hear me yes yes good

1180
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
um so i i think this this is kind of

1181
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,040
getting to some of the

1182
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,640
the same issues that i think mark raised

1183
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:00,160
earlier um and the problem with

1184
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,839
a lot of this is that the community

1185
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,839
likes to bike

1186
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:09,119
um and um if we have someone with uh

1187
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,640
publishing expertise and that's yeah

1188
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,480
you know i you know look looking at the

1189
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,078
text on the slide you i can see we could

1190
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,440
find someone with publishing expertise

1191
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,720
quite easily

1192
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,119
i could see we could we could find

1193
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,118
someone with itf process expertise

1194
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,560
quite easily who wants to be involved

1195
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,800
with the community

1196
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,799
we seem to be sort of looking at roles

1197
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,640
which conflate those two and i think the

1198
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,200
set of people who wish to be that

1199
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,720
closely involved in both communities is

1200
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
quite perhaps quite small

1201
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,160
quite a small pool and i think that's

1202
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,839
where we're getting hung up is the the

1203
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,680
interactions and how much

1204
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,240
involvement the publishing expert needs

1205
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,078
with the community

1206
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,118
so let me let me see if i can tease that

1207
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,160
out a little bit

1208
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,720
colin okay is

1209
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,920
if if you look at the way that an

1210
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,200
accountant works

1211
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:01,599
right an accountant probably can

1212
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,359
can say you know to the client right

1213
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,119
you want your taxes done i have a bunch

1214
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,240
of questions that i need to ask

1215
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,160
right um

1216
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,279
and this goes into our red text a little

1217
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,759
bit right

1218
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,880
it may be for the account the accountant

1219
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,680
to help

1220
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,480
crystallize the questions if you will

1221
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,879
and maybe

1222
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,760
guide the discussion a little bit in

1223
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,079
terms of

1224
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,599
you know by bringing color to the the

1225
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,920
discussion so that people are it can

1226
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,000
make informed decisions

1227
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,079
and then it's for the chairs of this

1228
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,400
group and maybe it's the same person or

1229
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,920
not

1230
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,960
we can discuss that to help sort of

1231
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:42,720
consolidate consensus right

1232
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,720
is is that really where we're aiming

1233
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,319
um i i think that

1234
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,200
this community doesn't deal well with

1235
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,480
that type of input

1236
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,799
um and and i think that's where where we

1237
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
get

1238
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,970
diffic where we will run into

1239
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,598
difficulties

1240
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:06,000
[Music]

1241
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,000
yeah but

1242
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,040
someone who um looks like they're in

1243
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,839
some sort of

1244
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,800
um and president say leadership or

1245
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,160
authority role

1246
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,520
because i'm not sure those are the right

1247
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,640
words but someone coming in with

1248
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,359
expertise and saying well

1249
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,759
this is what i think should happen we we

1250
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,279
tend to second-guess that

1251
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,880
and um those discussions tend not to

1252
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,920
reach closure very quickly

1253
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,319
and i think that would be quite

1254
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,240
frustrating for um

1255
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,359
someone who who is coming from perhaps

1256
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,279
the publishing

1257
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,880
community unless they are very used to

1258
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,520
our processes and i think that's a very

1259
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,880
small

1260
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:46,079
pool of people and we get stuck

1261
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,079
do you have a solve for that

1262
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,759
um no i'm i'm i'm not sure i do

1263
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,520
okay and that's that's a serious risk

1264
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:03,839
that you're raising

1265
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:03,839
other comments

1266
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,720
yeah so actually i think i mean like you

1267
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,559
can it's all the nuances but i think

1268
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,558
this text is a little bit a step back i

1269
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,160
i thought that we had already a lot of

1270
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,640
discussion about

1271
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,240
the need for an advisor role and like i

1272
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,440
know also about the term advisor we had

1273
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,919
a lot of discussion

1274
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,800
but the idea that you can pay somebody

1275
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,319
to actually provide technical expertise

1276
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,480
um and then a lot of other

1277
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:34,640
responsibilities

1278
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,880
that you list here in this slide should

1279
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,960
potentially be taken over

1280
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,720
by other entities so that might be one

1281
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,839
another person it might be a working

1282
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,399
group where the chairs

1283
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:46,000
draw consensus or whatever but i thought

1284
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,359
we already were on the track where you

1285
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,040
say we need to separate those things out

1286
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:54,799
i think that there i i think we've been

1287
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,079
going back and forth a little bit maria

1288
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,520
right we thought

1289
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,200
i think the chairs thought we were in

1290
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,800
that same point and then we had the

1291
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,879
interim and then there was a lot of

1292
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,520
concern raised about that approach to

1293
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,760
the point

1294
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,640
where we had to raise another issue on

1295
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,559
this and

1296
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,078
um and then brian helped us sort that

1297
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,440
quite a bit

1298
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,359
um well i don't think we have any

1299
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,119
consensus about how this structure could

1300
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,078
be and how many people and entities or

1301
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,760
whatever

1302
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,680
but i thought that there was at least a

1303
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,280
point about you know having this paid

1304
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,078
advisor who uh he brings in the

1305
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,240
publishing expertise somehow it says

1306
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:33,280
i i think that i think that that

1307
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,479
everybody agrees there is such a person

1308
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,280
what we don't agree is what else that

1309
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,119
person does

1310
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,559
so there are people who think that's it

1311
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,760
they're just

1312
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,559
the the usual expression is it's like a

1313
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,520
lawyer

1314
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:49,119
on on retainer when you need them you

1315
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,040
ask them they come in and they help you

1316
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,280
with whatever your immediate problem is

1317
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,880
then they fade into the background there

1318
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
are people who think that's

1319
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,880
it and there are people who think no

1320
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,200
there's more to it than that

1321
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,839
and that's where our problem is so yes

1322
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,078
we agree there is some kind of advisor

1323
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,240
the question is is it more than an

1324
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:10,480
advisor and that's where there's not

1325
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,160
consensus and i'm not even sure we're

1326
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:16,240
that far to be honest with crime

1327
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,920
right i haven't heard anybody say

1328
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,520
there's no adviser on

1329
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,079
on publishing issues we we we diff

1330
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,160
we disagree on whether that particular

1331
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,079
person is also an advisor on

1332
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,319
the example we're using here tooling

1333
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,160
issues

1334
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,920
rudiger did you want the floor because i

1335
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,399
saw your your hand go up and then

1336
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,599
it's for some reason it popped down uh

1337
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,720
yes

1338
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:44,800
not sure whether i i'm heard no

1339
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:48,959
yes you are can you hear me yes yes

1340
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:52,240
i don't hear you at the moment uh

1341
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:57,040
kind of to me the terms

1342
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,118
of a permanent strategic advisor came to

1343
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,800
my mind

1344
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:06,240
and it would

1345
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,440
look to me like uh finding

1346
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,879
the right advisor

1347
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,880
bringing in the

1348
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:20,880
expertise on the technical publishing

1349
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,559
uh well okay finding

1350
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:28,640
finding a good match there uh

1351
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:32,559
can already be difficult expecting

1352
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:36,078
that person to be also a an expert

1353
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:39,359
in some in some area that

1354
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:43,280
typically is

1355
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:46,160
a different job like

1356
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,480
expertise in software engineering and

1357
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,920
tooling

1358
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,440
makes it much much more unlikely to find

1359
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,640
a good match

1360
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,599
so i would think that actually thinking

1361
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,759
about

1362
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:04,960
in the whole picture a

1363
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,680
lead to communicate

1364
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,680
with the

1365
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:15,680
publishing advisor

1366
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,079
would be would be would be a good thing

1367
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,399
and

1368
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:23,520
actually and actually for uh

1369
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:27,599
getting a permanent strategy

1370
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:32,079
uh picking picking uh a person

1371
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:35,440
and putting into the publishing advisor

1372
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:38,400
um description

1373
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,440
of a reference that interaction with

1374
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,079
that person is

1375
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:47,440
expected i think would make a sense

1376
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,440
so i'm done

1377
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,520
okay now we can't hear you either

1378
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,000
um or i can't hear anybody else let's

1379
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:01,440
just test

1380
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,440
that mike do you want to go on

1381
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,880
yeah um one of the things

1382
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,399
that i keep thinking about with this is

1383
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,839
that we're missing a point

1384
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:18,079
that the grunt work for this

1385
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,640
is not exciting it's and

1386
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,839
having it having the expert there to

1387
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,480
advise us and

1388
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,680
to do most of the grunt work of writing

1389
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,559
writing the frameworks

1390
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,680
the documents that we need to to

1391
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,559
implement this thing

1392
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,279
seems to be seems to make a lot of sense

1393
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:34,880
um

1394
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,400
otherwise we're going to be dependent

1395
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,520
upon volunteers

1396
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,200
or something that is fairly critical not

1397
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:45,200
just for this

1398
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,399
you know not just for a tiny little

1399
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,319
piece of the problem

1400
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,760
but for the operation of the whole

1401
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,839
system

1402
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,920
i don't know how much arm twisting was

1403
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:55,920
necessary with respect to getting the

1404
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,119
various people who wrote the rfc

1405
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:02,960
documents um before and

1406
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:06,400
i know russ and um

1407
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,760
ola olaf and a few others um

1408
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,160
worked on them it'd be interesting to

1409
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,599
actually find out

1410
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,558
how much arm twisting it took to get

1411
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,680
them to do that so

1412
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,119
i think russ is on the call um russ do

1413
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,839
you want to jump the queue and answer

1414
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,839
that question

1415
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,240
we'll provide a perspective i know that

1416
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,319
there are other people involved but

1417
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,640
you do that i don't know that olaf is

1418
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,640
around

1419
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,680
okay so it did not take a lot of

1420
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,598
arm twisting there was a lot of people

1421
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,879
interested in solving the problem

1422
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:48,000
at the time um

1423
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,720
and we drew heavily on the iab

1424
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,760
okay so um

1425
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,879
[Music]

1426
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,880
all right john thanks russ by the way

1427
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,200
i just want to push a little bit not not

1428
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,480
necessarily back but push a little bit

1429
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:11,598
on this lawyer and account analogy uh

1430
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,839
my uh my attorney father used to

1431
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,480
used to claim that in addition to the

1432
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:20,000
bad ones there were two kinds of lawyers

1433
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,920
uh both good but for different purposes

1434
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,240
uh one of them was were people who were

1435
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,400
very good at answering

1436
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,200
the questions you asked if you and

1437
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,880
helpful if you do what questions to ask

1438
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,160
and the other of whom we're good at

1439
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,079
helping you understand what questions

1440
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,240
you need to ask

1441
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,520
uh this same comment applies to

1442
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,279
accountants

1443
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,799
uh there are accountants who are very

1444
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,400
good at

1445
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,720
dealing with whatever needs to be dealt

1446
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,160
with you handle the documents

1447
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,598
and uh but who will not push further

1448
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,200
although they may ask questions about

1449
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:56,000
those documents and accountants who will

1450
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,160
call you up and say i know enough about

1451
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,240
your financial picture to know that you

1452
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,598
should be paying attention to this issue

1453
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:07,200
are you doing so and

1454
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:10,000
those distinctions are really important

1455
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,720
when we start saying advisor is like

1456
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,559
a lawyer or accountant because depending

1457
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,240
on what else we think we need

1458
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,359
the difference between those two models

1459
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,359
gets to be very important

1460
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,880
and i don't think i have an answer to

1461
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,880
pick because it interacts with

1462
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,960
everything else we were talking about

1463
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,319
that was uh something um uh i think we

1464
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,200
discussed a little bit on the list

1465
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,240
so it's it's a good point to have uh he

1466
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,520
stated

1467
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:38,839
um and i didn't think it was good

1468
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,480
you know it's a good it was a good point

1469
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:43,119
um

1470
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,119
let me do this right what i propose is

1471
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:48,480
let me just back up a little bit

1472
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,920
for one moment um to uh

1473
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,280
bring up one point that was in the

1474
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,839
slides that we published right we've

1475
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,079
started we've gone off a little bit

1476
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:57,520
right um well let me just highlight what

1477
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,520
we thought we had consensus on

1478
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,599
right assuming that there is a person

1479
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,440
right we thought that the person

1480
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,119
could raise issues along the lines that

1481
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:06,640
you just mentioned

1482
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,680
uh john that if there's something that

1483
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,200
needs to be brought to the group's

1484
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:11,520
attention that person should certainly

1485
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:13,839
do that i don't think anybody

1486
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,200
would be uh and and not only that but

1487
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:16,558
there's another implication there

1488
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,200
that there's a bit of a long-term

1489
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,119
relationship such the person knows to

1490
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,660
raise those issues

1491
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,280
right um and um

1492
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:27,839
[Music]

1493
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,520
we also think that there that you know

1494
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,359
assuming the person exists that

1495
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,880
regardless whether the person exists we

1496
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:34,880
think everybody agrees that there's some

1497
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,839
strategic body that's going to make some

1498
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,319
that's going to make these decisions um

1499
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,480
and we

1500
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:41,839
think those are going to get documented

1501
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,040
in rfcs

1502
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:45,839
right that's we think that's the case

1503
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,680
right

1504
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,000
um we're still we still have to focus on

1505
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,598
this

1506
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,359
this big point here and one of the

1507
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,559
questions i raised on list and this is

1508
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,240
the one that i thought was

1509
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,599
you know what if this what if we view

1510
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,839
this person

1511
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,880
as something of a senior member of the

1512
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,839
rpc

1513
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,799
maybe with slightly different

1514
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:07,839
responsibilities right

1515
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:08,480
yeah i mean is where they where they

1516
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,920
guide

1517
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,920
this this conversation now a while ago

1518
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,400
we made the split right we said okay the

1519
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,720
the rsc doesn't doesn't work in the rpc

1520
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,599
but works closely with the rpc

1521
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,240
but if i don't know if it helps people's

1522
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,760
thinking

1523
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,879
right to think okay really what we have

1524
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,760
here is somebody who's trying to

1525
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,160
determine

1526
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,839
what the community you know how to

1527
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,480
facilitate community needs right in

1528
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,640
terms of

1529
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,760
an interaction with the rpc so the rpc

1530
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,680
can deliver

1531
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,799
appropriate uh product and and similarly

1532
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,799
along

1533
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:43,040
and similarly with the tooling team

1534
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:44,319
right i don't know if that helps the

1535
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,359
conversation

1536
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,240
but coming back to what miriam said i do

1537
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:50,720
think we have

1538
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,558
some some consensus here and i think the

1539
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:55,040
chairs think we have some consensus

1540
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,760
assuming that there is such a person

1541
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,799
right

1542
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,680
um i don't know if this helps advance

1543
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,880
the conversation

1544
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,359
but if this question here helps people

1545
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,880
think about the position then maybe we

1546
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:08,160
should discuss it if it doesn't then

1547
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,400
let's not

1548
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,160
right i did raise it on this and didn't

1549
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,200
get a lot of bites

1550
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:17,520
on that to be honest um to see

1551
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,439
to see if we could uh clarify it but i

1552
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,079
based this question largely

1553
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:24,480
on sort of a direction from where martin

1554
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,640
was coming from which is to give the

1555
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,640
rpc a little bit more of ability to

1556
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,960
tackle things day to day

1557
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,960
mark

1558
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,680
am i here yeah

1559
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,079
i think it's an interesting formulation

1560
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,160
it's one

1561
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:46,079
possible endpoint we could reach that

1562
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,879
that would be the conception that that

1563
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,799
of this role but it's an endpoint and i

1564
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,920
think we need to go through the process

1565
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,520
that convinces you know

1566
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,599
we get a rough consensus that that's

1567
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,000
where we that that fulfills all the

1568
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:04,559
requirements of what the community needs

1569
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,599
out of however we sell this um so

1570
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,559
i just didn't want you to leave thinking

1571
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,480
that this is not

1572
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,480
a viable solution anymore it's just that

1573
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,079
it's a solution and we still haven't

1574
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,839
gone through the process of figuring out

1575
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,359
what paths lead us to what possible

1576
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:20,480
solutions yet

1577
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,880
okay personally this is

1578
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
potentially viable i guess but we need a

1579
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,160
lot more discussion to figure

1580
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,440
out what you know to get to some common

1581
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,078
mind about

1582
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,040
where we want this to go first right so

1583
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,760
so

1584
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:35,759
just to apply this a little bit right

1585
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,160
we're talking about

1586
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,799
the tooling example that ecker gave for

1587
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:42,000
instance

1588
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:44,559
or you know for or for for uh

1589
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,160
say markdown right this person would be

1590
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,599
would be saying okay the community would

1591
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,040
like you know input or output of

1592
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,920
markdown depending on how you want to

1593
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,119
look at it

1594
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,079
right um you know the the the person

1595
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,680
would know that

1596
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:57,200
would would have worked and maybe would

1597
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:59,118
have worked in the rpc or maybe is

1598
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,240
brought into the rpc as a senior person

1599
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,680
or something like that

1600
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:06,078
to sort of work with this this body

1601
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,520
this this governance body that we've

1602
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,680
been talking about

1603
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,759
to try and you know ask pointed

1604
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,240
questions along the lines that john was

1605
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,160
raising

1606
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,680
in the context of say a long-term

1607
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,319
account right

1608
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,000
is i'm just uh what i'm trying to do is

1609
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,759
apply that hypothetical that we were

1610
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,280
discussing mark you want you want to go

1611
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,280
further with this

1612
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:34,799
i don't know yes there you are okay

1613
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,079
not particularly oh okay i saw your hand

1614
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:39,599
up that's why i

1615
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,119
okay so um let me let me leave that as

1616
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,880
food for thought all right martin

1617
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,039
if you want to comment as well i don't

1618
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,039
know

1619
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,359
yeah that was a misfire of me hitting

1620
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:52,720
the button here i'm okay i'm not

1621
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:54,078
so sure that i'm confident in saying

1622
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:57,919
that

1623
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,680
the senior member of the rpc

1624
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,680
to give the example that you you took

1625
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:03,839
there

1626
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,598
is the person that would fulfill all of

1627
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,038
the functions that we've been talking

1628
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,240
about here

1629
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:12,400
and um that that to me is that

1630
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,919
the challenge that i face i think that

1631
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,960
there is a greater role

1632
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,920
for i guess leadership of the rpc

1633
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:21,680
and having some involvement in the

1634
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,760
process here but i'm not sure that

1635
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,759
um that is the totality of what we're

1636
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,119
looking for here

1637
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,960
so it's it's a little difficult for me

1638
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,319
to to answer this question

1639
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,079
but fair enough may i ask you to

1640
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,599
maybe just to ponder it and share

1641
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,480
thoughts after you know

1642
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,240
and not just you but others if this is

1643
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,960
if this is a useful

1644
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,558
exercise in terms of sort of splitting

1645
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,400
the responsibility between

1646
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,160
what the rpc does what this um

1647
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,839
committee that we're going to talk about

1648
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,520
next does um

1649
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,200
maybe the thing that we take away from

1650
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,839
this discussion right is

1651
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:03,359
what is that interface between the rpc

1652
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:03,839
and the committee that uh we're going to

1653
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,680
bridge

1654
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,359
and ask people to maybe just share their

1655
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,200
thoughts on the list as we

1656
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,839
as we perceive is that a reasonable

1657
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,839
approach russ

1658
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:13,839
going

1659
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,920
so maybe it would help for me to spend

1660
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,319
one minute

1661
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,319
recapping how we got where we are

1662
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:31,038
it was the case before all of the

1663
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:32,079
structure that we have now where the rfc

1664
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,799
editor

1665
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,799
was one contract it had lived over

1666
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,000
underneath isoc

1667
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:43,119
and we asked the

1668
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,559
question why are we paying two

1669
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:49,680
um vendors the rfc editor

1670
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:53,119
and the secretariat to manage websites

1671
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:57,118
shouldn't we just be paying one

1672
01:04:53,119 --> 01:05:00,160
person to uh to manage

1673
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,039
putting things on the web

1674
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:05,200
and that led to the rc editor being

1675
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,079
broken into four roles

1676
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,118
the rfc series editor the production

1677
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,599
center

1678
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,280
the publisher and the independent stream

1679
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,680
editor

1680
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:17,680
so it be careful questions you ask

1681
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,078
sometimes they lead you places you don't

1682
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,078
expect

1683
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:27,038
but what we realized was the rfc series

1684
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,720
editor had nothing to do with publishing

1685
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,520
the works it had to do with uh

1686
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:36,000
strategic things not mechanical things

1687
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:38,160
and we tried to separate that

1688
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,839
and so i think it's a really bad idea

1689
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,839
now to slam them back together

1690
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,119
okay all right um

1691
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:54,319
i think we need some some ideas about

1692
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:56,559
how we perceive this this role still

1693
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,640
and in particular i still think we need

1694
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:01,599
it in particularly in the context

1695
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,720
of the interface to the to the

1696
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,240
governance group that we're going to

1697
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,439
talk about next brian you wanted a

1698
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,919
comment i'm sorry

1699
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,119
i i i kind of want to go back to russ

1700
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,240
and ask

1701
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:15,119
um is do you say that

1702
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:19,038
even though the rpc came out and said no

1703
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:22,079
no no we need some help

1704
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,119
yes okay

1705
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,760
because what we found what the problem

1706
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:31,280
we were trying to solve then was

1707
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,000
oh we need to meet our sla so we're not

1708
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,920
going to focus

1709
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,520
on strategic questions we've got to do

1710
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,960
this mechanical stuff

1711
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,960
and so basically the strategic stuff

1712
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,359
gets cycle starved if we put them

1713
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,359
together

1714
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:51,839
oh okay so so i understand that point

1715
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:54,720
and but you and and just

1716
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,359
just asking for your opinion you don't

1717
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,399
object

1718
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:59,359
to fulfilling the record the the the ask

1719
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,400
of the

1720
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:05,119
of the rpc to get

1721
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,359
get some get them some expertise because

1722
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:10,400
they say they rely on that expertise

1723
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:13,680
from time to time i i again i don't

1724
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,880
no one has argued against doing that

1725
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,480
right everybody says oh

1726
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:22,160
okay well we have to no no absolutely

1727
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:25,200
the person needs to help with with uh

1728
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,160
right you know answering questions

1729
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,799
and and offering advice and all of that

1730
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:32,558
what i'm

1731
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:35,440
saying is the other strategic stuff

1732
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:36,559
can't be subordinate to the mechanical

1733
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,480
stuff

1734
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:43,839
okay thank you okay

1735
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,839
so um

1736
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:49,039
what i'm going to say is let's let's

1737
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,200
please continue to ponder the

1738
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:52,400
the this role i'd like we might come

1739
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,000
back to this slide

1740
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,599
after the next one but i'm going to

1741
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
press on

1742
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,280
with the idea that people should should

1743
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:04,240
ponder this interface

1744
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:04,240
right and express what they want and

1745
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:10,720
maybe using a hypothetical if it helps

1746
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,720
to express that

1747
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,400
i think at this point we probably talked

1748
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,839
this issue out beyond

1749
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,440
the point where it's productive to

1750
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:20,479
continue

1751
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:23,120
at least on this call and we'll take the

1752
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,678
results to the mailing list unless we

1753
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,278
find that

1754
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:28,319
after the next issue we actually have

1755
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:32,239
more to talk about okay

1756
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:36,400
which leads us to the next issue

1757
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:39,599
um which is uh we started talking about

1758
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:42,960
unless the decision-making

1759
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:46,560
uh body right this the strategic body

1760
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,600
right and uh we saw three

1761
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,560
three four proposals come in um two of

1762
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,159
which

1763
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:58,560
had an open body and two of which

1764
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,559
had a closed body right

1765
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:05,198
what uh we also were able to recognize

1766
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:07,600
in the discussion is that it's only

1767
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:09,198
when we say closed we don't mean closed

1768
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,120
meetings we mean

1769
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:16,318
that the decision processes um

1770
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,080
uh are the people who vote or the people

1771
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:21,440
who decide

1772
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,359
um the people who have uh who get to

1773
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:25,120
have a voice in the decision

1774
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:28,000
either through rough consensus or

1775
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,519
through um whatever voting mechanism

1776
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,040
that's the part that's that we're

1777
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,480
discussing as to whether it's open or

1778
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:36,479
closed

1779
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:39,120
and i tried to just roughly

1780
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:41,278
give some thoughts on maybe how people

1781
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,318
might be viewing the benefits of open or

1782
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,159
closed membership

1783
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:46,400
these are elliot's thoughts though and

1784
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:48,799
and they could be entirely wrong

1785
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,719
okay and and i'm sure uh people will

1786
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:54,640
tell me just how wrong they are

1787
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,360
all right um but just to to give a view

1788
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,800
right

1789
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,839
it seemed to me you know we end up in

1790
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,000
situations where we're in sort of binary

1791
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:04,320
position

1792
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,199
right and so it probably helps to tease

1793
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,239
out

1794
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,599
what these differences are and this is

1795
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,559
only meant as a starting point and

1796
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,280
certainly not

1797
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,320
it's not a working group position at all

1798
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,320
it's just

1799
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,920
here's how i saw these things right and

1800
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,040
i think brian probably has

1801
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:23,120
a similar view right in terms of

1802
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,199
where we what we were interpreting what

1803
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:28,480
we're seeing in the discussions and

1804
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:30,000
why people were putting things forward

1805
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,239
in different ways

1806
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,320
and so for instance in the in the open

1807
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,919
membership model right it's this

1808
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,599
it's we're using our rough consensus

1809
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,920
model just the same way

1810
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,679
uh we always do for working groups right

1811
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,560
if the community wants somebody some

1812
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,239
somebody writes a draft right and it's

1813
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,880
discussed in a working group and then

1814
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:49,919
pushed through

1815
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:53,040
it forward through the process um

1816
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,960
and you know there is obviously the

1817
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,880
potential for lack of rough consensus

1818
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,239
and if something's really important to

1819
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,960
get done

1820
01:10:58,239 --> 01:11:03,199
um and there's no rough consensus then

1821
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:06,320
one can end up in a situation of

1822
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:08,159
uh analysis paralysis so it's it's you

1823
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,559
know one of the risks there's

1824
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:14,080
also um the with open uh membership

1825
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,760
there there there might be

1826
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:17,199
uh people who don't have skin in the

1827
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,760
game making uh

1828
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:21,120
have having an outsized voice but that's

1829
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,800
always a risk with a

1830
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,320
with with with our community driven

1831
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,360
model right this is not new

1832
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,799
or specific to this uh process what

1833
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,880
might be a little different about this

1834
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,000
process is that we may be talking about

1835
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,199
issues that

1836
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,840
don't normally come into play with the i

1837
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,879
you know in in terms of the ietf like we

1838
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,440
don't

1839
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,040
we don't know we're mostly experts on

1840
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,040
networking and not publishing and that

1841
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:47,440
that's a little bit of a difference

1842
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,199
and then if there's an open membership

1843
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,239
model right the accountability is to the

1844
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,839
community and those

1845
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,919
and and and whether or not you

1846
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,280
participated and the only people you

1847
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,719
have to blame is the people who

1848
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,120
participated in the process

1849
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,480
and and if you didn't then you know and

1850
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:04,000
that's it

1851
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,080
um in a closed membership right you have

1852
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,760
you can do expert selection if you want

1853
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:11,199
you can do people who

1854
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,120
you can represent the the

1855
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,519
you can have participation from those

1856
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,360
people who are essentially the ones who

1857
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:18,719
who have to work day-to-day with the

1858
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:20,400
with the with our

1859
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,960
rfc development process production

1860
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,320
process the stream managers

1861
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,080
maybe maybe others um

1862
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,920
the the accountability is to those

1863
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,120
individuals who participate in

1864
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,800
assuming that uh it isn't a long chain

1865
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,679
to get there right it's sometimes

1866
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,960
i think sometimes frustrating um some

1867
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,040
people view this as a good thing some

1868
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,520
people view this as a bad thing

1869
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:45,280
um and um and then the definition of

1870
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,840
community comes back into this question

1871
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:48,719
like

1872
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,640
who is this process solving as a serving

1873
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:52,880
right is it serving the ietf community

1874
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,800
is it serving a broader community

1875
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,719
how broad and these are all topics that

1876
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,000
have been raised on the mailing list

1877
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,679
so um again this is just my view

1878
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
i think people should feel free to

1879
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,159
absolutely use your own criteria in

1880
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,159
terms of how you view this issue

1881
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:09,360
um discard anything you see on this

1882
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:11,120
slide if you if you think it's not

1883
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,320
useful and develop consensus based on

1884
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:15,519
any other point

1885
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:20,639
right um but this is sort of how

1886
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,640
uh i was perceiving it so without mike

1887
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,400
yeah um so one of the things i want to

1888
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:34,799
make a point about is how this group

1889
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,839
might differ from a normal working group

1890
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:40,480
as an open membership thing

1891
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,080
we don't normally acknowledge it but our

1892
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:45,120
working groups sort of function

1893
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:46,800
as meritocracies of some flavor the

1894
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,440
people who are involved the people who

1895
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,719
are talking

1896
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:51,599
people who are writing the code tend to

1897
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:54,000
have

1898
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,520
heavier weight given to their decisions

1899
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,440
than

1900
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,760
than the other people given the product

1901
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:03,280
here is going to be the documents that

1902
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,040
describe the standards

1903
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:10,559
process unless we get

1904
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:12,320
volunteers who are writing this stuff um

1905
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,239
and again like i said i don't know that

1906
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:18,080
that's going to happen a lot

1907
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:18,559
um you know we russ rusted mentioned you

1908
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,559
got

1909
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,120
you grabbed it from the iad as opposed

1910
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:26,960
to going for a general working group

1911
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:29,440
for the previous documents um

1912
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,600
you may want to think about how you

1913
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,080
would how you would structure the thing

1914
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,000
so that again we don't get to the

1915
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:40,159
consensus paralysis problem

1916
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,159
if we don't have that meritocracy thing

1917
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:48,480
happening

1918
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,480
thanks for that um mark

1919
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:59,919
yeah yep

1920
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:03,280
yeah i i think um i i

1921
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,120
agree that that that dynamic is going to

1922
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,400
be important to watch

1923
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,040
i do think that this group can

1924
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,159
operate with open membership uh if we

1925
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:14,159
set it up

1926
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:15,599
in a way that encourages good

1927
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,040
participation

1928
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:21,679
um i think

1929
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,440
this this in my mind you know brings to

1930
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:25,840
mind this role of

1931
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,360
the expert advisor and how their voice

1932
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,920
would be heard in this group

1933
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,920
and my expectation would be that that is

1934
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,719
one form of the meritocracy that

1935
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,120
you know phil was referring to um sorry

1936
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:38,400
mike

1937
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:41,920
uh i

1938
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:44,080
i i i have a i guess a

1939
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,600
medium-ish strong preference for a

1940
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:49,120
membership on this

1941
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:51,520
but my lie down in the road kind of

1942
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:53,120
aspect of this is that if it does it

1943
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,080
does have a closed membership of some

1944
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,719
form

1945
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,120
its decisions need to be made in public

1946
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:02,640
the input to it needs to be public

1947
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,080
it needs to be accountable none of this

1948
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,840
you know oh well i talked to a few

1949
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,360
people and we decided to go do this or

1950
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,120
whatever it needs to operate

1951
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,239
as if it were a working group in the

1952
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,239
sense that we run them where

1953
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,360
the community can go and look and say

1954
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:17,120
okay they just made this decision and

1955
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,400
they made it based upon these principles

1956
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,719
and on this input

1957
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,920
and and this reasoning process and

1958
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,000
reconstruct that

1959
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,400
and if we can't do that i don't know why

1960
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,400
we're here

1961
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:31,839
yeah um just a a comment um

1962
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,040
i think and tell me if you think i'm

1963
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,000
wrong mark

1964
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,360
i think mike's draft sort of covered

1965
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,120
that ground pretty well

1966
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,040
you know in terms of making these

1967
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:44,000
decisions out in the open did you

1968
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,760
would you agree or disagree with that i

1969
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,120
i don't have it paged in

1970
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:51,520
um i i could go and have a look uh

1971
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,199
but if anybody disagrees with you know

1972
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,440
the characterization that i just gave

1973
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:56,480
i'd love to hear it and i'd love to hear

1974
01:16:55,440 --> 01:17:00,000
why

1975
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:03,839
yeah me too all right thank you

1976
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,840
uh eric

1977
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,199
i think i partly agree with mark and

1978
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:10,159
that i think um but i guess i think i

1979
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,839
think it should be open i

1980
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,199
don't think like i don't think even the

1981
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,080
amount of daylight he's proposing is

1982
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,320
really acceptable

1983
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,760
um i want to talk about this sort of um

1984
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,880
this topic of skin in the game which i

1985
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,520
think is a little odd

1986
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,880
um in the sense that like the basic

1987
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,239
assumption here is that the people who

1988
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:25,360
participate in the itf working groups

1989
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,400
the people who are writing the documents

1990
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,960
and therefore are the

1991
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,559
like people who will be like engaging

1992
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,760
with the engaging with the rfc

1993
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,360
publication process

1994
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,560
so you know it was of course possible

1995
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,239
that people were just hanging out and

1996
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,960
not engaging with rc publication process

1997
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,000
but i think

1998
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,360
we should reasonably waste nothing to

1999
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,320
have some skin in the game and so the

2000
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,440
idea that like close

2001
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,639
close group somehow because there's a

2002
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,678
people have more seen in the games it's

2003
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,719
unusual with me

2004
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,159
like why would that be the case um so i

2005
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,440
guess i i'd like i think to hear you

2006
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,879
elaborate on why you think that case

2007
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,280
that close group of houses more skin in

2008
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:57,120
the game than an open group

2009
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,639
um okay the the thinking is that the

2010
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:01,199
people can just walk into a working

2011
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,520
group um you know they and participate

2012
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:04,879
we allow that in fact we encourage it

2013
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,400
it's how people get their start they

2014
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,280
don't get their start usually by writing

2015
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:10,719
an internet draft

2016
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:12,639
sometimes they do right and maybe they

2017
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,480
participate in the development of work

2018
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,280
that's already ongoing

2019
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,320
um they may or may not uh they may have

2020
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,840
walked into the room

2021
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,280
for reasons that you know they just

2022
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,640
wanted to see what was going on they

2023
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,000
found oh this is interesting and they

2024
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,840
comment

2025
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,040
um and they and they may not be

2026
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,480
publishing rfcs

2027
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,760
right they may not even they may not be

2028
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,199
in the editor queue they might not even

2029
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,800
have an internet drive

2030
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:34,879
but they might be interested maybe for

2031
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,440
other reasons right

2032
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:39,520
um unto themselves and it's not like

2033
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,519
they would be illegitimate right

2034
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,440
it's just that the people who are

2035
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,239
day-to-day active

2036
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,519
in in these things tend to be the stream

2037
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:51,759
managers

2038
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:53,760
um who have to stream managers and to

2039
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,280
a slightly lesser extent but only

2040
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,199
slightly the authors

2041
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,559
right the the stream managers have to

2042
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,159
you know work with each of the authors

2043
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,600
pretty pretty closely

2044
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,599
um in terms of publishing that's

2045
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,640
certainly much more so the case you know

2046
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,640
the ise is a

2047
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,600
specific individual right who who does

2048
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,920
this the you know the area directors

2049
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,440
um in their capacities as uh

2050
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,679
representing the ietf stream when a

2051
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,239
document comes forward for discussion

2052
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,120
um right though they have to they have

2053
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:22,159
to interact

2054
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:23,360
interact directly um that's that's all i

2055
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,360
meant and again

2056
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,639
you can choose that logic or not by the

2057
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,000
way you you could say well

2058
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,360
actually i don't agree with elliot

2059
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,560
anybody should be able to participate

2060
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,920
and everybody's uh

2061
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,920
has skin in the game it's the readers

2062
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,440
that have skin in the game you can fill

2063
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,920
in that value for yourself

2064
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,360
right uh it it was just you know my own

2065
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,440
perception and

2066
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,199
entirely reasonable to maybe even more

2067
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,120
reasonable than i than i have on the

2068
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,239
side to to disagree with me

2069
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,040
martin oh well i guess i didn't want to

2070
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,040
i didn't want to find

2071
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,199
it's actually like this is a situation

2072
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,239
in which like

2073
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,678
these people will probably have more

2074
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:58,320
skin in the game than almost any other

2075
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,360
situation

2076
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,320
you know like an ietf where you know we

2077
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,679
routinely like

2078
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,360
you know routinely made to make made

2079
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:05,840
technical decisions based on people who

2080
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,280
like

2081
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,960
may never implement the protocols have

2082
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:10,480
opinions right but like

2083
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,560
more or less by definition the people

2084
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:13,919
who are like you know who are in

2085
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,120
in these meetings like are engaging in

2086
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,960
the idea center's process are probably

2087
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,080
consumers of and potentially future

2088
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,719
authors or rfcs so i think like you know

2089
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,199
like you know it's it's it's either they

2090
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:24,560
they

2091
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:25,919
have more skills in the game than almost

2092
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,360
any other condition where you make it

2093
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,440
decisions

2094
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:34,719
fair enough entirely reasonable

2095
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:37,759
um martin yeah so i was

2096
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:39,280
about to make a similar point um

2097
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,520
when you look at both of these options

2098
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,280
here you are essentially still staffing

2099
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,320
them with volunteers

2100
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,719
and um whether they

2101
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,719
are appointed for a term or or just turn

2102
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:53,360
up on on their own recognizance

2103
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:54,320
so um i actually think that the open

2104
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:57,599
membership

2105
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:59,280
program stands a better chance of taking

2106
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,040
the sorts of input that we're like

2107
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,880
likely to see from

2108
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:08,080
uh document authors and and the like

2109
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:11,040
whereas the the close membership thing

2110
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:12,880
has this barrier to engagement whereby

2111
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,719
okay so the meetings are in public

2112
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,400
but they're at a scheduled time that's

2113
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,719
inconvenient for me

2114
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,599
i i don't feel like like i can send an

2115
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,920
email and then

2116
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,360
then engage in the conversation on an

2117
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,920
ongoing basis because that

2118
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:27,199
that's just not how these bodies operate

2119
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,040
necessarily i

2120
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:30,960
i'd have to re-read mike's draft in

2121
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,199
order to see whether he had

2122
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,239
addressed that or had ideas along those

2123
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:35,839
lines but

2124
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:38,799
i ultimately think that the open

2125
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,120
membership is is more likely to

2126
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:42,719
to attract the sorts of input that we're

2127
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:46,719
looking for here

2128
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:48,320
and um i share mark's concerns about

2129
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:51,040
making sure that this process is open

2130
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:54,000
and well documented what not

2131
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,199
okay before we go further uh let me just

2132
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,239
ask

2133
01:21:55,199 --> 01:22:02,239
um are there people who would actively

2134
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:05,199
object to the open membership model

2135
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:05,839
and if you could um john and phil can

2136
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,159
you can you

2137
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,120
um unless you are going to actively

2138
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,759
object

2139
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,800
um could you let those who are uh skip

2140
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,320
the queue and then we'll come back to

2141
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,120
you

2142
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:19,920
you actually object you're actively

2143
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:19,920
under could you say more

2144
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:30,480
i i i had intended to okay please

2145
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:33,520
since since i'm first in the queue uh

2146
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:37,120
let me let me come back to that

2147
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:40,880
that working group meritocracy analogy

2148
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:43,679
uh and make another one uh

2149
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,600
in the case of a working group the

2150
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:47,520
people who become active in a working

2151
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,159
group and that is active as distinct

2152
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,440
from

2153
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,759
half asleep in the back of the room

2154
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,839
doing email uh

2155
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:56,080
tend to be people with specific interest

2156
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,080
in subject matter and specific expert

2157
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:59,120
and and specific expertise in subject

2158
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,800
matter

2159
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,800
and within a working group and i think

2160
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,040
this is part of what mike was talking

2161
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,159
about we're just talking about expertise

2162
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:10,000
uh the people who don't have a clue uh

2163
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:12,080
rapidly get filtered out people stop

2164
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:16,080
paying any attention to them

2165
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:17,600
um and in years past we've been brutal

2166
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:20,480
about that and we've

2167
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,080
i hope gotten a lot less brutal but the

2168
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,678
effect is the same

2169
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,120
and sometimes that doesn't even work

2170
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,560
very well because

2171
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:32,000
uh uh the boundary between

2172
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,719
not expert and uh and having

2173
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,320
expert and competent views which the

2174
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:37,360
people driving the working group don't

2175
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,960
agree with

2176
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,400
sometimes get very confused with each

2177
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,920
other uh

2178
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:43,599
but let's draw another analogy to

2179
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,040
something which is open

2180
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:50,400
um is discussions on the ietf list

2181
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:53,440
and discussions in the iedf list uh

2182
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:56,638
have often especially in recent years

2183
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,480
uh turned into situations where

2184
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:00,159
uh people are expressing very strong

2185
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,239
opinions about subjects they know almost

2186
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,360
nothing about and

2187
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:08,159
uh and then we go into rat hole

2188
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:10,480
tours with very long threads which never

2189
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:14,320
really go any anywhere

2190
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:17,040
and my concern about an open group

2191
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,040
gets back to the question of having

2192
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,719
sufficient expertise

2193
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:23,280
and to paraphrase a comment which was

2194
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:25,120
made in the chat a situation in which

2195
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,480
the expertise loses

2196
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,840
because the people with very strong

2197
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,678
opinions and the people who may be there

2198
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,040
because they have agendas which are

2199
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:36,239
different from

2200
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:37,920
whatever the agenda is of the expert and

2201
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:39,360
indeed whatever the agenda is that we

2202
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:42,159
come up with

2203
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:44,320
um dominate the discussions because they

2204
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,679
have the time and energy and passion

2205
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:48,080
as distinctly because they know what

2206
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,360
they're talking about and again we've

2207
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:52,480
seen that on the ietf

2208
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,719
list so i'm not

2209
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,360
a whole i certainly want the kind of

2210
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:01,520
openness that mark was talking about

2211
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:02,400
uh and uh and i'm not opposed to any of

2212
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,719
that

2213
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,400
but i think if we go for completely open

2214
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:10,080
and dependent on

2215
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:11,199
whoever shows up we end up with the itf

2216
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,719
list problem

2217
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:14,960
and indeed to a certain degree some of

2218
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:18,639
the problems which have plagued

2219
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:21,520
this group uh which is to say

2220
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:22,960
some of these uh uh we usually talk

2221
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,280
about elephants in the rule but it may

2222
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,639
be more like alligators in the room

2223
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:32,080
um uh yet issues get

2224
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:33,840
suppressed because we're busy trying to

2225
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,440
come to conclusions

2226
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,880
and that's where the coming collisions

2227
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:38,559
worthwhile ideas

2228
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,639
when our conclusions are hiding those

2229
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,719
fundamental issues and those fundamental

2230
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,880
disagreements about

2231
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,560
what things are what things are about

2232
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,760
what things are important

2233
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:50,800
uh there's a tendency to to get bogged

2234
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,440
down and drift

2235
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,800
and for the expertise to get lost in the

2236
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,799
process

2237
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,239
and i fear in this particular kind of

2238
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,920
environment we're talking about

2239
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:02,159
for the experts to get frustrated and

2240
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,159
quit

2241
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:09,840
thank you john um phil

2242
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:26,639
phil we can't hear you

2243
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,040
sorry uh yeah on the open versus closed

2244
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:30,960
piece the problem is though that

2245
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,480
this is an area where if you close the

2246
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,560
working group

2247
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,080
uh how can you be sure that you're

2248
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,440
shutting the expert

2249
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:41,519
in rather than out

2250
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:43,440
this is an area where there are a lot of

2251
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:46,960
people who imagine that they are very

2252
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:48,320
expert and are very fond of telling

2253
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,679
people who

2254
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,759
have say you know spend a considerable

2255
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,719
amount of time and effort putting

2256
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,840
together

2257
01:26:54,719 --> 01:27:01,440
a global hypertext document system

2258
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,960
and being part of intensive sessions on

2259
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:06,400
this topic

2260
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:09,920
for several decades with very

2261
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:12,638
very well-known people in that field and

2262
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,800
get told well you know absolutely

2263
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:18,960
nothing about it

2264
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,719
um i'm a bit i'm feeling a bit of brisk

2265
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,960
with this conversation because

2266
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,320
i can't quite see how many levels of

2267
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,320
meta

2268
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,840
we are at the moment we seem to be

2269
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:31,040
discussing

2270
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:35,199
process performing a process to discuss

2271
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:38,560
something um one big difference

2272
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:42,000
in this work and regular ideas work

2273
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:45,040
is that the premise i get working with

2274
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,960
isn't finished in that you know

2275
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:48,320
gets he did the work and he started

2276
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,080
working with

2277
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:54,880
as mp3 to do the work you know the ips

2278
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,519
is not quite off the standard body and

2279
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:01,840
you don't

2280
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:01,840
have a regular review structure

2281
01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:16,800
[Music]

2282
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:21,519
as part of the famous startup

2283
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:26,480
and here's why with the xml personnel

2284
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:29,679
a lot of the decisions that a lot of

2285
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:31,678
might have stood you know

2286
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:34,480
might have wanted to duplicate that and

2287
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:38,239
uh you know die on that kill

2288
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:40,959
five years ago let things slide

2289
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:42,559
saying okay yeah uh getting the right

2290
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,280
answer from that that's not really

2291
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,719
important

2292
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:49,040
to me right now i just need to get into

2293
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,040
now

2294
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:56,480
and then by the time that things

2295
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:56,480
kind of like opened up

2296
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:09,040
we have to start from the perspective

2297
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:12,080
here that

2298
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:15,440
this is going to be an ongoing

2299
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:18,960
process that doesn't have a preset

2300
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:20,638
end that there's going to be refinement

2301
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:23,600
and that people have to underst

2302
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,560
how to know that okay we can let it

2303
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,239
slide

2304
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,400
now because there'll be another

2305
01:29:26,239 --> 01:29:29,040
opportunity in two years or three years

2306
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:32,159
time

2307
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:35,679
to bring this up if we didn't get

2308
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:35,920
a hearing last time but although you

2309
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,719
know

2310
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,679
something that really does gum up the

2311
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:42,960
works

2312
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:44,239
is if people have told well it's too

2313
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,280
early

2314
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:48,959
to raise that now then

2315
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:53,519
when they try and raise it later they

2316
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:56,560
say well you're too late and that's

2317
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:57,520
been happening okay so so i think i want

2318
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,560
to just

2319
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,280
tease out a couple of things here uh i i

2320
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,199
heard your point

2321
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,040
that uh which i thought was a good one

2322
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:06,480
which was that um if you're

2323
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:08,480
if you have a closed membership how do

2324
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:12,000
you know that you're not shutting that

2325
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:13,839
the experts out and how do you even

2326
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,400
identify expertise i think was one of

2327
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,920
the

2328
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,080
key points you made the other point that

2329
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:20,719
you were making was uh the

2330
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,840
timing of raising issues or otherwise

2331
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:24,480
processing

2332
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,159
changes let's take those separately and

2333
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,559
just focus on the first for the moment

2334
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:29,440
but

2335
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,239
but feel free to open up an issue

2336
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:33,280
separately

2337
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,320
on the the modalities of the group that

2338
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,000
gets formed

2339
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,239
because i think that's that's something

2340
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,760
that that you're capturing

2341
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:41,759
um joel

2342
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,080
um unfortunately i don't think these

2343
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:53,040
as we've noted multiple times i don't

2344
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:55,920
think these questions separate doubt

2345
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,560
i'm very sympathetic to the issue that

2346
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,960
we want

2347
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,800
good ways to get real community input

2348
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,679
something better than the current rfc

2349
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:07,040
interest email

2350
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:10,239
if i have a strong rsa model

2351
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:12,320
if this group adopts a strong rsa model

2352
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:14,638
then having an open group that works

2353
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:16,960
with that art strong rsa

2354
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:19,360
attracts me is eminently effective

2355
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,239
however if i'm stuck with a weak rsa

2356
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,199
model

2357
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:24,400
then it better be a carefully selected

2358
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:27,678
and small

2359
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:29,920
group it works with that rsa because

2360
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,080
the combination of a weak rsa and an

2361
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,639
open quasi-working group that's supposed

2362
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:38,000
to make the whole thing magically work

2363
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:40,480
causes my head to explode

2364
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,480
so just to elaborate there a little bit

2365
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,040
joel stick around for a moment

2366
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:47,040
when you say a strong when you say a

2367
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:50,239
strong rsa versus a weak

2368
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:51,199
rsa let's just be a little bit more

2369
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:55,440
specific

2370
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:57,599
you mean what do you mean by that

2371
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:59,759
i'm not hung up on a very precise

2372
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,920
meeting but for example

2373
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:06,560
an rsa who is acting as the chair of the

2374
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,199
of this working group and empowered when

2375
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,400
needed

2376
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:11,839
to make things happen but is expected to

2377
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,360
be paying attention to the working group

2378
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:16,400
and going along and working with the

2379
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,480
rough consensus of the community

2380
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:20,480
something like that is a strong rsa a

2381
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:23,440
weak rsa is an advisor who's asked

2382
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:26,000
questions and gives opinions when asked

2383
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:27,280
okay thank you and there's room to fudge

2384
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,679
in there i'm not saying that those are

2385
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,480
the only two possibilities in the world

2386
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:34,080
okay gotcha thank you very much um you

2387
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:39,120
might want to elaborate that a bit more

2388
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,120
unless as as we go forward um rudiger

2389
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:48,800
uh looking at the alternatives of

2390
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:48,799
open versus close membership

2391
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:56,800
what i'm seeing is looking at

2392
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:59,679
how we are running stuff in the ietf

2393
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:00,960
there are actually there are actually

2394
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:04,960
things that

2395
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:09,840
uh kind of allow

2396
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,840
allow a hybrid operation

2397
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:17,679
i would guess that

2398
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,880
there are good reasons for running an

2399
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:23,600
open membership

2400
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:25,840
working groups kind of thing

2401
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,840
but

2402
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:32,400
alongside of working groups in regular

2403
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:34,840
itf

2404
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,400
organization we sometimes have

2405
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:39,600
directorates

2406
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:43,839
which are kind of close close

2407
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:47,360
groups of uh well well-defined groups of

2408
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:52,000
named persons and uh

2409
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:55,920
for uh say the

2410
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:59,360
uh interfacing to an rrsa

2411
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,639
of of some kind uh probably

2412
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:06,000
such such a fixed group would be

2413
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,639
much better than the not so clearly

2414
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,840
defined

2415
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:12,960
open membership group that certainly

2416
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:16,560
is somewhat better for

2417
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:18,880
representing and bringing the input

2418
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:20,719
from the community side in an open

2419
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,320
fashion thanks

2420
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:26,719
thank you okay um

2421
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,719
brian

2422
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:32,159
hello uh so um a couple of things

2423
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,280
actually

2424
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:36,320
i i kind of agree with rudiger in the

2425
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,800
generalities but

2426
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:40,400
probably disagree in the specifics um

2427
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,840
richard burns just typed into the into

2428
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,799
the chat uh something that i'd like to

2429
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,080
reflect here

2430
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,840
does it need to be said that closed

2431
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:47,280
membership does not imply either expert

2432
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,520
or skin in the game

2433
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,040
um i think it does imply sort of like

2434
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,560
accountability can be had

2435
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,400
um i think it does imply that there's

2436
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:58,000
like someone who is designated

2437
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:59,839
uh to be part of this um uh

2438
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,600
uh sort of decision making process the

2439
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:03,840
strategic process and i think that there

2440
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,440
are our wins to having that even if

2441
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,119
there's not like sort of the

2442
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:08,559
direct implication that it's always

2443
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:12,000
going to be you know

2444
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:14,800
an expert within the game um

2445
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,560
i was i i'm a little tempted to say that

2446
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,080
like this is this open membership versus

2447
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,880
closed membership thing is a little bit

2448
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,440
of a

2449
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,560
a false dichotomy i think we can have a

2450
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,638
process

2451
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,000
or uh something that gets you the best

2452
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:27,119
of both worlds here so that's where i

2453
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,320
agree with rudiger

2454
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:33,519
in the uh the generalities um one thing

2455
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:34,400
that um the iv has uh done recently and

2456
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:37,040
i applaud them for

2457
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,920
is be more open to the idea open meeting

2458
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,239
where we get uh

2459
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,440
information about the programs uh some

2460
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:43,919
of the programs have

2461
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,678
have built out um they're still

2462
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,719
membership oriented but open meetings

2463
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:48,000
but they've built out sort of

2464
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:51,360
memberships that are

2465
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,199
are um much more inclusive uh than

2466
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:54,880
um sort of some of the you know

2467
01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:56,159
hand-picked experts groups and programs

2468
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,199
in the past

2469
01:35:56,159 --> 01:36:00,879
um i'm wondering if a hybrid model like

2470
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:02,239
that along the lines of an iep program

2471
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,920
could work where you essentially have a

2472
01:36:02,239 --> 01:36:06,638
set of appointed people

2473
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,080
um to this body who are required to have

2474
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,639
open meetings that would have sort of

2475
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:11,679
like

2476
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:14,320
an open mic portion of the open meeting

2477
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,480
are required to um consider that input

2478
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:18,000
uh and also have them sort of like an uh

2479
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:20,799
open discussion on the mailing list so

2480
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,080
it's it's not closed in terms of we have

2481
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:23,280
a closed door where you can talk about

2482
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,480
things that will remain

2483
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,920
confidential because there's no

2484
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,799
disagreement at all but we don't want

2485
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,560
that

2486
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:29,840
um but it's closed in terms of there are

2487
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,600
people who are designated by the

2488
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,239
community who are responsible for be

2489
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,679
uh for being this um strategic body i i

2490
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:37,678
would encourage us to look at that sort

2491
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:41,040
of like a hybrid model like that

2492
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:44,480
so uh brian are you familiar with

2493
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:46,639
mike mike st john's draft

2494
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,839
i am not i kind of parachuted into this

2495
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,960
meeting today

2496
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,320
okay i pay attention to the to the early

2497
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:53,840
part of this process because i was

2498
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,559
taking a break from the iab for the last

2499
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,119
year

2500
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:58,000
well congratulations on that welcome

2501
01:36:57,119 --> 01:37:01,360
back

2502
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:03,920
uh can you read mike's draft

2503
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:05,040
yes a little bit a little bit of that

2504
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,760
right but i think

2505
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,239
so i think the contention here isn't so

2506
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,199
much

2507
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:11,919
on being able to provide input i think

2508
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,960
what i heard

2509
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,320
from mike's draft and from neville's

2510
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,960
draft as well

2511
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:20,239
was that there should be an input an

2512
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,199
open input process

2513
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:24,080
that the process should be transparent

2514
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:25,919
um

2515
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:28,559
but that there are p there are decision

2516
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,880
makers uh that are appointed

2517
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,600
either through the either ex officio or

2518
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,920
or

2519
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,679
or or selected through nom nom-com or

2520
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,719
something along those lines

2521
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:41,360
um and then there's a different view

2522
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,639
right where it's the more the working

2523
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:45,599
group model

2524
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:48,080
um right but i think just from the

2525
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,600
chairs perspective sitting as a chair i

2526
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:53,760
think there's

2527
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:57,440
strong consensus very strong consensus

2528
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,320
that the model be whatever we decide be

2529
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:01,360
entirely

2530
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,960
transparent right and that that

2531
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,480
that people have the opportunity to

2532
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:07,600
provide input that no

2533
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:09,599
nobody is surprised by decisions and if

2534
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,400
anybody believes that's incorrect

2535
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,560
let it speak loudly and as mark put it

2536
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:18,080
earlier and explain why

2537
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,800
yeah so so yeah okay so so given that i

2538
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:20,400
think i would be

2539
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,560
i would you know my opinion would lean

2540
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,280
toward a closed membership model

2541
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,600
a closed membership open process model

2542
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:27,679
um

2543
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,040
simply because i think not for the for

2544
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:30,880
the expert selection reason

2545
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,159
not for the skin of the game reason but

2546
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,360
i think that this is an important enough

2547
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:34,638
function to the community that we want

2548
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:35,599
people who are essentially held

2549
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:38,080
accountable

2550
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,960
um for uh for driving the strategy

2551
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:42,000
forward

2552
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:44,159
then i have a request of you um

2553
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
not just to read the draft of course but

2554
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:48,638
always and to everybody else right

2555
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,080
um but if you have a model a selection

2556
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:53,199
model in mind

2557
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:54,960
um and it doesn't match that of mic

2558
01:38:53,199 --> 01:38:57,519
yeah that you that you put something

2559
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,080
forward yep uh i can i can do that

2560
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,000
definitely

2561
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,000
um i i don't actually have a model in

2562
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,719
mind but i will think about it

2563
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,239
okay we're coming close to the time

2564
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,639
where we want to move on to

2565
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:10,239
um some of the other points in that we

2566
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:12,480
have on the agenda

2567
01:39:10,239 --> 01:39:13,759
um so uh let's see here brian i think

2568
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,638
this is the part where we close the

2569
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,639
microphone right

2570
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:24,400
for for the for this issue um

2571
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:27,679
just to check with my co-chair yeah

2572
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,320
all right i i'm not sure that we can do

2573
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,159
any of this

2574
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,679
because there's no consensus to write

2575
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:33,519
any text

2576
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,040
yeah not yet but we'll let's let's get

2577
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,400
there in a moment uh wes

2578
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,639
are you closing the queue or are you

2579
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:40,879
okay western market now we're gonna

2580
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:40,880
finish

2581
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,719
let people in the queue speak wes

2582
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,960
um i i think that you the important

2583
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,880
question that

2584
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,480
uh you know has come up for me in the

2585
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,000
past discussion is

2586
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:00,080
how does the community interact with the

2587
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:01,760
group regardless of whether it's open or

2588
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:02,880
closed regardless of whether it's open

2589
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:05,920
for observance or

2590
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,679
open for participation how does the

2591
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:10,480
community give feedback and so

2592
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:11,600
you know an example would be should this

2593
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:14,320
strategic body

2594
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:16,239
have an open mic line at the plenary

2595
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:17,679
should the strategic body be

2596
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:19,280
you know have an open mic line that's

2597
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:20,080
part of another open mic line that

2598
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,480
already exists

2599
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,280
like you know the iv you know previously

2600
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:26,638
the heather

2601
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:28,880
sat on um you know so

2602
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:30,239
i think community feedback is an

2603
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,440
important consideration

2604
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:37,040
that uh the results of any

2605
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:39,360
strategic body ends up greatly affecting

2606
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,280
the uh the participants of the entire

2607
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,480
atf and there has to be a feedback

2608
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,239
mechanism there

2609
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:47,119
what does that feedback feedback

2610
01:40:44,239 --> 01:40:47,119
mechanism look like

2611
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:51,839
thank you um mark

2612
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,080
thank you wes that was actually uh

2613
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:01,600
really good and it leads right into or

2614
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,679
or is complimentary to what i was

2615
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,360
thinking which is i think

2616
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:07,600
the the the characterization that's

2617
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:10,239
bugging me here is the word closed

2618
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,440
in that uh looking at the disc listening

2619
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:12,239
to the discussion looking at what's

2620
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:15,199
happening in in

2621
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:16,559
jabber i i can see a model where the

2622
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:18,879
decision making

2623
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,600
is modified from how our group works

2624
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,080
that

2625
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,199
you know it's some combination of our

2626
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,239
reported experts

2627
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:27,839
and the the stream uh leads and

2628
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:29,759
maybe some other folks but you have a

2629
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:31,920
nominated set of people who are

2630
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:34,480
either either make the decisions or have

2631
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:37,040
unusual weight in making decisions

2632
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:38,080
and that's very handy i know but what i

2633
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,960
don't want to see

2634
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:42,400
is a an expectation that they will talk

2635
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:44,320
amongst themselves the community will

2636
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:46,719
just merely watch

2637
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,840
uh or or be allowed to dial into a call

2638
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,880
once in a while

2639
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,520
that to me is not an open

2640
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,639
participation model i would expect as a

2641
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,360
member of the community if i'm not one

2642
01:41:54,639 --> 01:41:57,679
of those people

2643
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,360
to be able to get something onto a

2644
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:00,560
meeting agenda provided that enough

2645
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,440
people think that it's reasonable to

2646
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,560
talk about

2647
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,159
i would expect to have an open

2648
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:04,960
discussion much like we're happening

2649
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,320
here

2650
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,880
having here it's just that the final

2651
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,480
decision might not be

2652
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:12,960
made in a way that we typically make in

2653
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:14,959
a working group and if we can

2654
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,400
come up with a model like that i i think

2655
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,520
i could could support it

2656
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,519
but i don't think we should call it

2657
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:20,719
closed membership i think well first of

2658
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,840
all membership is is

2659
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:24,400
a weird concept in the id anyway so uh

2660
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,840
uh

2661
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:27,920
i think it's worth exploring in that

2662
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,400
direction but

2663
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,440
like i said i do really want to be able

2664
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,119
to bring something to the group's

2665
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,960
attention and if it's thumbs down don't

2666
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:38,480
do it because of reason xyz

2667

2669
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,638
okay we did close the list but if you're

2670
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,519
really quick mike and it's

2671

and it's just like to respond uh please

2672
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,400
please just be brief

2673
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:59,600
um open we have closed groups the iab

2674
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:02,639
and the iesg are selected

2675
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:05,600
for a particular set of responsibilities

2676
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:05,600
this is no different

2677
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,239
okay so uh thank you all right we didn't

2678
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,920
actually

2679
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:13,519
neither neither of the chairs actually

2680
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:17,199
expected to close this issue

2681
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,719
uh today um we but i do think we've had

2682
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:21,839
a pretty productive

2683
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:24,560
uh dialogue um a couple of uh

2684
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:26,480
comments just to wrap up uh people don't

2685
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:27,600
like the word open or closed we caught

2686
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:30,159
that it's

2687
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:31,840
uh it's how the it's it's the selection

2688
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:34,559
for who gets to decide

2689
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,360
uh as part of decision that's number one

2690
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,199
whether it's the

2691
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:38,559
the people who show up in a working

2692
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,839
group or whether it's people who are

2693
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:42,880
selected

2694
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,560
based on some criteria um that's that

2695
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,280
that was one issue i think the second

2696
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:48,000
issue

2697
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:49,840
uh that that we heard loud and clear and

2698
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
i want to confirm this on the list

2699
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,920
but any model that's put forth even if

2700
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,800
it's a model in which people are

2701
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,280
selected

2702
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:59,360
specific people are selected that there

2703
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:00,800
has to be an ability for the community

2704
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:04,080
to interact

2705
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,520
with those people openly that there be

2706
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:08,800
transparency

2707
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:12,400
that and that decision process is um

2708
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:15,920
uh be uh documented etc

2709
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:16,719
um and i don't think anybody uh has

2710
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:20,000
argued

2711
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:24,080
uh differently along those lines uh the

2712
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,679
one um the one exception

2713
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,360
that i did put on the slide was that

2714
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,000
there was the possibility

2715
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:31,119
that personnel decisions personnel

2716
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,520
discussions

2717
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:34,480
uh could hit in in mike's case i think

2718
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:36,880
you said this

2719
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:38,400
the rseb that's something further to

2720
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,400
discuss on the list as to what the

2721
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,759
limits of openness would be in these

2722
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,199
contexts in terms of

2723
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,800
any sort of personnel selection and

2724
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:45,919
whether there is personnel selection

2725
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:48,080
discussions

2726
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,600
in in these things and i think that that

2727
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:51,920
that has to be further

2728
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,880
discussed there are some issues open on

2729
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:54,639
that and i

2730
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,560
i encourage you to take take a look at

2731
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:59,360
those um

2732
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,440
so moving forward then what we'd like to

2733
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:06,719
do is continue the discussion about

2734
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:08,719
what people would find acceptable and my

2735
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:11,679
suggestion is this

2736
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,080
if you have a preference for one or the

2737
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:14,960
other

2738
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:16,960
on why don't you state it on list but

2739
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:20,159
also go to the other

2740
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:21,360
go the other way and say if the if if do

2741
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:22,638
what joel did

2742
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,559
which i thought was great and i think

2743
01:45:22,639 --> 01:45:26,320
mark you did the same thing which is if

2744
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:29,040
it goes away that maybe i might

2745
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:31,040
not prefer right what would be the

2746
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:33,040
parameters under which i could find it

2747
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:34,239
the the other acceptable if people can

2748
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,639
get those out

2749
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,839
onto the list i think that will help

2750
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:41,679
move the discussion

2751
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:43,520
forward um and so with that

2752
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:45,840
the chairs had two other issues on the

2753
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,840
agenda

2754
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,239
the first is probably going to be a very

2755
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,840
short discussion indeed

2756
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:54,638
but i keep saying that and i keep being

2757
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,639
wrong so we'll see

2758
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,320
so we think probably it helps that as we

2759
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,560
begin

2760
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,239
and i do think we are going to be able

2761
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,800
to start to close

2762
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:05,919
some of these issues soon i think we are

2763
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,600
going to

2764
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,679
call me an internal optimist but i

2765
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,520
believe like that last issue

2766
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,440
we are going to be able to start to find

2767
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,400
some common ground

2768
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:18,000
soon and so once we do find that common

2769
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:19,679
ground we need a way to document it

2770
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,280
and of course the way we document common

2771
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,679
ground at the ietf

2772
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:25,440
is through a draft and so we think we

2773
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:28,080
need a skeleton

2774
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:29,119
um to to to start to capture this so

2775
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:31,920
that we have

2776
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:33,839
uh text that we can bite into and and

2777
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:37,040
maybe debate a little bit more

2778
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:40,480
as as we come closer to consensus

2779
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:42,000
um it should have the mostly capture the

2780
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,000
consensus that we have

2781
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,040
and if it's not perfectly captured then

2782
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,719
we debate it and get towards consensus

2783
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:51,199
um and we think we'll need an editor to

2784
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:52,800
do all of this we haven't discussed who

2785
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:54,638
that editor would be yet

2786
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,840
um but we'd like to proceed along the

2787
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:58,480
lines that

2788
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,600
we'll pick up a person uh to do this of

2789
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,678
course it'll be a person

2790
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,280
who who's involved in this in this group

2791
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:06,080
i'm sure

2792
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:07,920
um and so all i want to ask on this

2793
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,239
question does anybody have any

2794
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:13,520
objections that the draft would not take

2795
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:16,400
positions that are have not had

2796
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:23,840
a consensus declared are there any

2797
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:23,839
concerns with that approach

2798
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,360
mike do you have your hand up at this

2799
01:47:27,119 --> 01:47:29,839
point for for this particular topic or

2800
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:33,280
or

2801
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,280
is it just up for some other reason

2802
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,440
okay uh ecker did you want to get a word

2803
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,440
in

2804
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:48,239
i guess i don't i have half a concern

2805
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,719
um as you mean i think this is a fine

2806
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:50,559
approach

2807
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:51,920
in general but i think that like as i

2808
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:54,000
sort of

2809
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:55,679
just reiterate my comment earlier that

2810
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,280
like i think we're going to get

2811
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,040
substantially further along before

2812
01:47:57,280 --> 01:48:00,400
like we're going to be able to iterate

2813
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,920
on this in this way so

2814
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,199
um but i have no problem with this

2815
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:04,800
proceeding at this point once we get to

2816
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,799
the point where like we actually already

2817
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,480
start putting stuff down

2818
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:10,239
to just be clear right we do have a few

2819
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:12,320
things that we have consensus on

2820
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:13,759
right if you look in the tracker they're

2821
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,759
very basic stuff

2822
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,960
right and and so take a look at the

2823
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,320
tracker

2824
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,600
provide your comments on list if you're

2825
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,559
comfortable with those at least being

2826
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:22,639
written down and then

2827
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,320
if you if you see you have concerns and

2828
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:26,000
for instance adrian raised some

2829
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,519
i forget which issue was but he did

2830
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,840
raise some concern about a little bit of

2831
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:32,880
the text that needed to be wordsmith

2832
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,480
um and take a look at those

2833
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,239
it's not like we have nothing here and

2834
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,678
actually brian was really good at

2835
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:40,000
highlighting that which i i want to

2836
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:46,239
thank you brian carpenter in particular

2837
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:47,920
on that okay john

2838
01:48:46,239 --> 01:48:49,759
first of all i think this is a fine a

2839
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:52,560
fine approach and i'm very much in favor

2840
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:56,080
of it i just want to uh

2841
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:58,239
raise the caution again that we not

2842
01:48:56,080 --> 01:49:00,800
managed to get text in here which papers

2843
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:03,839
over a very fundamental disagreements

2844
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,040
uh where we are agreeing that the text

2845
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:07,679
is correct

2846
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:09,040
in papering over those disagreements but

2847
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:11,520
in papering over those disagreements

2848
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:14,960
they tend to get lost

2849
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:19,440
so just a question we'll take it

2850
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:19,440
uh pete welcome pete

2851
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,400
am i here there i am uh you're most

2852
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:29,519
definitely here or there

2853
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:32,239
he's i generally try to duck

2854
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,080
uh saying anything in this group but i i

2855
01:49:32,239 --> 01:49:37,360
would ask the chairs

2856
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:38,320
to do a really good review of the jabber

2857
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:40,880
room

2858
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,400
um after this session because i think

2859
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,440
there are a bunch of people who actually

2860
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:46,879
agree on a lot

2861
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:49,759
more than is apparent from the voiced

2862
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,199
discussion that's been going on um i i

2863
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,639
think there's some good stuff going on

2864
01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:54,879
in there

2865
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,159
okay thank you for that um yeah we have

2866
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,719
this little problem which is one of the

2867
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:58,719
chairs

2868
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,480
particularly i cannot see the jabber

2869
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,040
because of the technical issues earlier

2870
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,638
but

2871
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,400
your point is very well taken and thank

2872
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:07,199
you for that okay

2873
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,638
um so we'll proceed along these lines uh

2874
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:12,320
very conservatively

2875
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:15,679
okay to john's point and to eric's point

2876
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:17,280
um and uh we'll um we'll be in touch

2877
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,440
with you about this but please comment

2878
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:22,080
on the list if you would like

2879
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:24,400
all right that brings us to our last uh

2880
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,480
second to last issue sorry um

2881
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:27,839
meeting time in and operating methods um

2882
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:29,040
so uh

2883
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:30,800
and this probably goes to a little bit

2884
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:32,080
of what pete just said so we'll we'll

2885
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,599
come back to them

2886
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,360
issues are going to at least get aired

2887
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:37,360
in at least one meeting

2888
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,400
and that's because i think perhaps we do

2889
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:41,598
a little better

2890
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:43,280
um in in terms of

2891
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,280
trying to go through these issues and

2892
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:47,840
when we talk together

2893
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:50,080
and i think people like that idea we did

2894
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,840
say that

2895
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:52,960
we said that meetings after some

2896
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,639
discussion we said that meetings would

2897
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,119
take place roughly every four weeks with

2898
01:50:54,639 --> 01:50:57,599
varying

2899
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:58,960
uh you know varying times to com uh to

2900
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:02,159
accommodate time zone

2901
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:03,360
issues um and and we said that

2902
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:06,239
everything would of course be

2903
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:07,280
be confirmed on list um the only other

2904
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,598
thing i would say

2905
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:12,480
is um if they're if the opportunity

2906
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:14,960
arises to gain consensus and email

2907
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:18,159
if nobody really has great concerns then

2908
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,679
we don't have to wait for a meeting

2909
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:21,280
maybe we have a three week discussion

2910
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,800
period but

2911
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,320
it we're going to be conservative the

2912
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:25,199
chairs will be conservative about that

2913
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:27,519
if we don't see

2914
01:51:25,199 --> 01:51:29,598
a reasonably good consensus then we'll

2915
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,480
just wait till the next meeting

2916
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:34,159
um in terms in terms of that as as we

2917
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:36,080
have been today right we didn't

2918
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:37,440
we didn't try and say well we have

2919
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:38,960
except for on one point we're

2920
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,119
pretty sure comfortable we do have

2921
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:44,159
consensus i don't think we

2922
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:47,199
it wasn't a new point either um

2923
01:51:44,159 --> 01:51:50,400
so on that second bullet

2924
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:52,879
is anybody uncomfortable with

2925
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:54,799
these aspects here if you want to

2926
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:56,639
comment

2927
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,920
right we'll still continue with our with

2928
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,159
our meetings as we

2929
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,520
we said and if there's if we can knock

2930
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,759
down some stuff

2931
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:05,280
um you know prior to the meeting that's

2932
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:07,280
great and if not

2933
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,599
um we'll continue along the same ways

2934
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:09,599
mark

2935
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,800
your consensus calls are crystal clear

2936
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:17,519
with the distinguished subject

2937
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:20,320
maybe lots of all caps so forth because

2938
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:20,320
there's a lot of email

2939
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:26,880
yeah okay we'll make it we will be very

2940
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:28,960
clear about it thank you

2941
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,800
okay i'm not hearing a lot of concern

2942
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:35,040
about this um

2943
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:36,719
and we'll let's see how we go

2944
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,400
i think we have some sticky issues a lot

2945
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:40,239
of a lot of issues won't meet the model

2946
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,280
we don't need to discuss but maybe some

2947
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:43,360
will

2948
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,719
um along the lines of the next meeting

2949
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:47,519
we said about every uh

2950
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:49,920
month um today's the 19th of november

2951
01:52:47,520 --> 01:52:52,000
the 19th of december is a saturday

2952
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,440
um so uh the following the following

2953
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,920
week runs us into

2954
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:58,239
uh holidays so what we do is we we

2955
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:01,679
propose to have the meeting um at

2956
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:05,199
at this time uh which would vary uh the

2957
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:08,080
um the time based on uh

2958
01:53:05,199 --> 01:53:09,040
you know the the fact that we're uh uh

2959
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:13,040
relatively

2960
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:13,679
um uh we're trying to hit the right time

2961
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,880
zone

2962
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,400
you know distribution um

2963
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,560
what i would say is if people have

2964
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:24,000
strong objections to this time this is

2965
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,360
uh 2300 gmt if they

2966
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,960
if they'd like to have the time in

2967
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,679
another meeting just drop the chairs a

2968
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,840
note

2969
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:31,119
um if you want to copy the the program

2970
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,840
list that's fine

2971
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:35,679
but um we think this is the the right

2972
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:37,599
time for the next meeting

2973
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:38,800
for people to participate it's not

2974
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:42,239
convenient for everybody

2975
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:44,159
but we'd like to set an interim for that

2976
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:46,320
and if you have strong objections please

2977
01:53:44,159 --> 01:53:55,839
you can say so now or you can

2978
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:55,840
bring them to the list

2979
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:03,920
okay um and that brings us to

2980
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:05,440
uh any other business um do we have does

2981
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:09,840
anybody want to raise any other business

2982
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,839
before we close

2983
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:23,839
all right um brian do you have any

2984
01:54:17,040 --> 01:54:23,840
closing thoughts you want to add

2985
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:33,440
i guess i'm taking that as a new

2986
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:36,959
yeah i had a little little local problem

2987
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:40,239
it's okay um no i'm i'm i'm okay

2988
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:43,599
we're uh we're slowly getting somewhere

2989
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:46,799
um hopefully we can get into some level

2990
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:50,400
of consensus and some of these more not

2991
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:52,080
uh relatively here given where we are

2992
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:55,119
now

2993
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:57,040
okay all right um

2994
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:58,239

2997
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,880
conversation i know it seems frustrating

2998
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:07,119
that we're moving along slowly

2999
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,040

3000
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:11,119
