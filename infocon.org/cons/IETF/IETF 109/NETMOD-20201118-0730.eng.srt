times but here's the link the first time

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,879

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,480
chat icon which is next to

it covers all of our formal ietf

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,479
meetings

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,759
i think people are largely familiar with

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,080
it if you're not

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,000
it basically says that everything you

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,798
say here becomes part of

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
our public record and is a formal

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,040
contribution to the ietf

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
if you're not familiar with the notewell

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
please take a look at the link on the

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,839
bottom

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,360
and read it at your leisure

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,759
next so

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,240
um if you're hearing this now you know

36
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,479
that we are using meat echo

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,479
we

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
media echo will cover um cue control

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
there's a button

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,960
if you'd like to raise your hand and

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,039
join in um

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,199

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
care of

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,119

49
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,719
jabber it's uh

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
for me it shows up as a little red icon

51
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,639
next to the

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,080

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,200
sorry uh please make sure to

68
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
go and check that whoever is doing the

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,280
note taking

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,080
uh as accurately reflects your comments

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
the agenda uh actually i think we're

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
ready for that so let's go to the next

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,160
slide

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
um the agenda has not been updated

75
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
although i'll note that that

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,359
for the yang versioning update there's

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,319
actually

78
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
two presentations uploaded two different

79
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
powerpoints

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,599
i believe jan will go first followed by

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,560
bo

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,280
and i think we still have a little bit

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
of time

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,720
maybe five minutes that's not accounted

85
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,440
for even though we are a very

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,400
short session so i think we have enough

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,519
time for

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,120
uh discussion and

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,599
although we always seem to run out of

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,440
time at the end but we'll try to

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,238
keep things moving along with the agenda

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,239
next please

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,080
we've had one rfc published

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,640
since the last meeting thank you all to

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
who contributed to that that's obviously

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,040
why we're here is to

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,120
produce the documents such as this so

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,040
thanks thank you again we have two

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,040
documents in the rfc

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,239
editor queue one is in off 48

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,319
and i think we have to uh poke the

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,920
authors and i should say that i think

103
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,200
i'm a co-author on that one so we have

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,159
to book the authors to make sure that

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,839
they respond

106
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:16,399
so that we can uh complete that one and

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:20,079
um i think anything noteworthy to say on

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,440
syslog model only that is dependent on

109
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,320
the work that's in that conf

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,719
the uh client servers suite address

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,080
specifically a tls client server

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
which will hopefully be going into

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,880
working group last call um

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,720
in the not maybe in a month's time so

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,159
once once it gets published then the

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,600
syslog draft will be

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,960
unblocked that's great

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
thank you we also have one draft that's

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,638
in

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,000
iesg processing the nmda diff

121
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,520
and we have several that are um

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
post last call uh we'll see if rob is

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,280
rejoined

124
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
um he's actually the author we're

125
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,440
waiting on for the the

126
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,919
first two of these posts last call

127
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,400
obviously now that he's in ads

128
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,400
finding time to wrap things up is

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,919
difficult

130
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,159
the geo location we had been waiting on

131
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,400
an

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
update i believe that has been updated

133
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
since the last meeting

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,960

um we haven't had any liaisons incoming

173
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,639
outgoing i believe rob you were going to

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
bring this

175
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,440
up um in the next session uh is since

176
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,319
you're having audio issues do you want

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,319
to make any comments

178
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
now

179
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,199
uh yes so um so effectively there's been

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
some discussion

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,880
with uh in the packages and the version

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
of work between some of the authors

183
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,560
about the yang models that are being

184
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,159
done within

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,759
3gpp and oran and some of the approach

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,280
approaches that they're trying to use to

187
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
reuse those models

188
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,318
and to almost like standardize

189
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,080
deviations so

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
i think it would be useful to have some

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
discussion on the list of

192
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
um of what they're doing there and it

193
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
may be that we need to

194
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,280
be helpful for netmod to make a liaison

195
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,560
to um

196
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,000
either 3gbp and or oran about how

197
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,680
they're trying to reuse

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
uh yang models and give them some

199
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,919
violence on some advice on

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
how best to do that and what problems

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,000
that they can

202
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,840
hit if they don't uh don't change attack

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,840
um balaj can probably speak to this as

204
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
well for 3gpp

205
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,639
as a participant as a participant in

206
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
both

207
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,720
3gpp and or unsightly

208
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,080
i intend to start a discussion on the

209
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,479
mailing list

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,479
in the co today or tomorrow about this

211
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
basically the problem is that 3gpp

212
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,638
defines some standards

213
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
oran would like to refine these

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,680
standards

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,680
in some way and they plan to you or

216
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,159
they're considering to use deviations

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,080
for this refinement

218
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,599
and yep then we have deviations in a

219
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,479
all-round specifications kind of

220
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
like standard

221
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,800
okay uh in whatever

222
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
we send formally it's very important

223
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,519
that we reference back

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,440
to either rfcs or

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,920
graphs covering the topic and

226
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
i think we have appropriate text we can

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,719
reference

228
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,479
in on this topic but if we find that we

229
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,360
don't we might have to

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,560
generate some in the form of a new draft

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
or an updated draft

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,560
i think the packaging draft

233
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,160
should be gonna have such text

234
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,439
great all right thank you um

235
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,680
uh next slide please

236
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
i've been the queue this is the final oh

237
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
i'm sorry

238
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
you're in queue rob did you have

239
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,399
something

240
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,399
more to say oh you just left you okay

241
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
next slide then all right thanks

242
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
uh so finally we just want to point out

243
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
that

244
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,560
we are going to continue with this

245
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
working remote motive for at least a

246
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,680
little while

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:00,160
um i'm sure folks have noticed that

248
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,800
iedf 110 is going to be online we're not

249
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,800
sure

250
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,160
how much longer it will continue through

251
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,680
next year but clearly

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
our current mode of working will

253
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,680
continue into next year

254
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,640
um so we want to make sure to

255
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,519
continue the energy the momentum that we

256
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,959
have

257
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,519
in the working group and to do that um

258
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,518
between meetings and we think you know

259
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,640
obviously our working

260
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,720
group mail list is a key way to

261
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,319
to collaborate but we also have other

262
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,959
tools we have

263
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
both informal and formal virtual

264
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,439
meetings that we can do

265
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,920
we have the webex available some uh

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,000
groups are already making use of that if

267
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,120
you'd like to make use of it for

268
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,320
informal uh meetings please just let us

269
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,800
know and we can

270
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,880
set that up for you leaving the chairs

271
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,079
and if you think we have a topic or if

272
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,040
we think there's a topic

273
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:58,319
that hits sort of critical mass we'll

274
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,880
we'll have a more formal virtual intro

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,079
both these informal and virtual meetings

276
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
are of course

277
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,959
um announced on the working group list

278
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,519
and are open to all

279
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,359
um that's i'd like to quickly note that

280
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
that's true even for these informal

281
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,720
meetings

282
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
um if you're you know using the the

283
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,240
working group webex

284
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,360
we intend that we'll make that open to

285
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,040
everyone and

286
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,640
uh who knows you may even have someone

287
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,760
come and contribute in a positive way

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
that you wouldn't expect

289
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,200
so there are definitely benefits uh

290
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
and of course there's the the most

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,440
important benefit which is

292
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
um by including the working group we're

293
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,480
helping build consensus

294
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,240
on whatever work is being done

295
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
uh with that leave um

296
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,360
we can move on does one of my

297
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,360
co-founders want to add anything

298
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,040
no except that it does take a little bit

299
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
of time to flip between slides and also

300
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,800
i was wondering uh you mentioned there's

301
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
two

302
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,800
presentations for um the versioning

303
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,680
which one goes first the update or

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
packages

305
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,199
probably update so i think update goes

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,120
first which is dan

307
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
unless dan you wanna correct me

308
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,760
that's right

309
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
okay

310
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,000
it takes just a couple clicks like five

311
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,279
confirmation windows in order to

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,279
get it to show almost there

313
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,079
it's so uh i was

314
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
picked to represent the the group of

315
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,638
people uh

316
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,319
authors and non-authors that have been

317
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,079
working on the versioning

318
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,519
solution set uh mostly because of

319
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,839
time zones i believe because i'm in

320
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,680
europe uh

321
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,600
so next slide please it will be

322
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,519
giving a very short solution overview

323
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
here and then we'll go into

324
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,560
much versioning semantic versioning and

325
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,560
yang packages and

326
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,599
bo will present the last piece because

327
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,439
that's the most interesting one

328
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
where we are spending most of the time

329
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
in our work right now

330
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,199
and there are this presentation here

331
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
contains some background but

332
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,560
especially i want to spend most of the

333
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,240
time on the sort of

334
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,079
open questions here so hopefully i'll

335
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,279
get some feedback from you

336
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,760
next please so

337
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,720
this giant versioning solution consists

338
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,519
of five

339
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:39,199
different drafts one is about uh

340
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,600
how we handle revisions uh i mean

341
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,040
yang has his own revision scheme already

342
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
it's very useful for

343
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,319
standardization bodies which typically

344
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
have a single

345
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
line of release release train if you

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,480
like everything is a very linear model

347
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,839
but many of the vendors that are using

348
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
yang find that

349
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,760
model is somewhat troublesome because we

350
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,680
have several release trains going out in

351
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,360
parallel so like you have the five dot x

352
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,439
line of products and the six

353
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,360
dot x line of products going out at the

354
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
same time so how we handle revisions

355
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
when there are several

356
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
living release trains at the same time

357
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
that's the question there

358
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
and number two is about how do you name

359
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,360
those versions

360
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,560
so when do you how do you use version

361
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
numbers to reflect

362
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,760
uh what versions are going there and how

363
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,560
they are compatible

364
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,240
and we are basing that of out of semver

365
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,680
december concept

366
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,000
but sember is also a linear model so it

367
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,479
has to be tweaked a little to allow this

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
simultaneous release trains

369
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,760
then we are spending most of their time

370
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,199
right now on packages so how can you

371
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,480
make release releases of sets of modules

372
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,000
at same time and version them as a group

373
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,000
and then we have potential operations

374
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,600
for a client to choose which version

375
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,880
of a yang interface that this client is

376
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,399
prepared to use

377
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
in the case that the server supports

378
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,040
more than one

379
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,639
and then some tooling for how do you

380
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
compare two yang malls and see what is

381
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,639
compatible and not and so on

382
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,639
so that's where we are next please

383
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,839
we as in the summer we spent a lot of

384
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,279
time on versioning but we got

385
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,360
it stuck and i'll come back to that on

386
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
on some slides a little bit later

387
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,839
and we thought that some of those sticky

388
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,040
bits might get resolved when we were

389
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,600
working on packages so that's

390
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
where we went over even though we had

391
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,560
sticky bits

392
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,279
left we have bumped the comparison

393
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,040
and the versioning drafts but we haven't

394
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,639
really added any real information in

395
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,279
them it's just

396
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,000
some editorial details and updating the

397
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,480
xml format and so on

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,759
and even though we spent considerable

399
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
time on packages

400
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,920
we still see there's lots left to go

401
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,959
there and that's where our focus will

402
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,519
will remain for a while we think

403
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,518
next please

404
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,800
and uh we are very interested to have

405
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,000
everybody that's interested

406
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,479
we are interested to have interested

407
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
parties participate and contribute

408
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
to this work and we are having weekly

409
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,199
calls on tuesdays 2

410
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,079
pm uk time anybody can can

411
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,439
come in and contribute their authors and

412
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
others

413
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,920
we have a github issue tracker you can

414
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,839
see the link there

415
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,959
so anybody can add new issues

416
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,600
with the drafts there and

417
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,319
we see a plan that we would like to

418
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,959
release

419
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,079
body versioning yang server and packages

420
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,439
as one unit

421
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,319
probably first and then save this

422
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,920
selection

423
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,240
and comparison for a little bit later

424
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,839
next please so let's go and discuss the

425
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,199
the sticky questions in module

426
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,480
versioning a little bit next please

427
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,160
next so

428
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,519
uh one of the things we've been talking

429
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,480
about is white space changes

430
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,599
it's we have seen in packages and the

431
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,280
when we're discussing

432
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,039
that it can be convenient to have a

433
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,879
checksum of the packages

434
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,039
and to check some of the modules so that

435
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,839
we can see that

436
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,839
things have or have not

437
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
uh

438
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:45,039
the white space changed or not

439
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,559
and if we want to have checksums on

440
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,879
modules

441
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,480
probably white space changes

442
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,080
would constitute a version change at

443
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,080
least at the editorial level

444
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,520
but we can also say then that deleting a

445
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,919
space or adding a blank line should not

446
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
really

447
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,080
it doesn't change the interface it does

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,520
change the model the yang model but it

449
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,960
does not really change the interface

450
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
that the young world describes

451
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,080
so how do we treat versioning as related

452
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,639
to that

453
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:29,840
if anybody has any immediate comments on

454
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:29,840
this i would be interested to hear

455
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,159
okay then next slide

456
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:57,840
one of the concepts

457
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:57,840
revision or

458
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
well module a could import module b or

459
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,440
version 200

460
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:14,160
or derive it for example saying that

461
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,880
two one five or two to six could work

462
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,679
uh but this is uh proving somewhat

463
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,919
problematic

464
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,039
uh when uh

465
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,400
there might not be any 200 revision and

466
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,240
there might be a three or a revision

467
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,679
which might not be compatible

468
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
so how should the compiler or whoever is

469
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,840
doing this

470
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,678
import find out what we are actually

471
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,520
importing and this is actually where one

472
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
of the sticky points that we decided to

473
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
let's do packages first because packages

474
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
might

475
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,439
specify exactly which modules that are

476
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,960
being used or something

477
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,760
so that's one of those areas where we

478
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,280
said that

479
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,840
resolving packages might actually

480
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
resolve this

481
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,440
any comments on this one

482
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,440
um as chair not not on this one but on

483
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,000
the list

484
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
on chat window tom hill's asking some

485
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,159
questions

486
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,159
um tom can you speak to the mike

487
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:19,440
please yes hello um can you hear me

488
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,120
yes perfect um it was

489
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,840
more because if we're thinking about

490
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,840
adding white space

491
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,840
and and being concerned over to whether

492
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,360
or not this actually creates a minor

493
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,320
version would be a new version of the

494
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,158
model

495
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,799
the question which should be why are you

496
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,480
adding white space now

497
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,639
why would you do this at this moment we

498
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,440
can we can with proper change control we

499
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,600
can queue up

500
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
lots of little changes into it into even

501
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,480
a minor release

502
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,840
and then control it that way yes i think

503
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
it makes good sense to

504
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,399
treat even white space changes as a

505
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,360
version change uh at least an editorial

506
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,360
change

507
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,520
uh for for many reasons like version

508
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,080
control and for keeping track of

509
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,039
well if somebody is cleaning up line

510
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
endings or whatever

511
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,240
to make it proper module everybody else

512
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,559
should be basing their work out of that

513
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,840
so

514
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,080
then it needs to be treated and like

515
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,678
inversion so it makes good sense from

516
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,840
that point of view

517
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,840
i believe sir

518
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,520
i moved ahead two slides yeah that's

519
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
fine

520
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
uh i don't know if i should looking at

521
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,360
the participant list through the chat

522
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,679
now with

523
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,559
okay so when it comes to

524
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
this import statement that is importing

525
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,559
not by revision but

526
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:47,120
by revision or derived

527
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,840
we come to the question whether a change

528
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,039
of the module that is being imported

529
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,320
uh or if the even if the if you change

530
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,960
the import statement

531
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,960
so that your

532
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,280
changing the rules for what will be

533
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,399
imported like you're changing from 200

534
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,120
or derived to 2 1 0 or derived if that

535
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
should be

536
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,959
if that's change in itself should be

537
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,360
considered a backwards compatible or

538
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
incompatible change

539
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,520
so we have option a that any change of

540
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,000
the module is incompatible or option b

541
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,360
that

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,080
yeah as long as the resulting schema is

543
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,840
not changing

544
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,280
it's considered to be a backwards

545
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,280
compatible change

546
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,678
and that's uh discussion has been going

547
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,720
back and forth and there's many small

548
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,400
things to trip over here but

549
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,480
the recommendation from the group is

550
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
probably option b as i have

551
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
seen i think it's on the next slide

552
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
actually

553
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,840
next please

554
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,200
yeah so the rough consensus is option b

555
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
and we think that as long as schema is

556
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,360
not changing

557
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,520
uh a change of the

558
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,760
of the import statement itself should be

559
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
considered editorial change

560
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
but further discussion is needed and if

561
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,600
you have any comments on this

562
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,600
either now or on the list that would be

563
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
appreciated

564
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,720
i don't see any immediate reactions so

565
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,760
let's go next slide

566
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,080
and next steps is basically next to

567
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,360
resolve these issues before the next itf

568
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,960
but

569
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,879
that's of course hopefully i had for

570
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,919
some time but let's see if we can

571
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,919
work this out on the list and next yeah

572
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,880
please next

573
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:39,280
next again so on the versioning

574
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
we have been focusing mostly on packages

575
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
but we have a couple of open issues that

576
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
may be

577
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,559
worthwhile to mention here at least so

578
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,559
next please

579
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,720
there is this case in semantic

580
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,320
versioning i mean there's a pre-release

581
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,559
mechanism in semantic versioning which

582
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,559
makes it possible to

583
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,918
to mark a particular version to be a

584
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,240
pre-release of something

585
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,919
but sometimes it's possible to release a

586
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,840
pre-release version that has bumped the

587
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,960
major version so for example you have 1

588
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,799
0 you make

589
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
a pre-release of something that's not

590
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,360
compatible so you

591
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,960
call that 200 but in the end maybe that

592
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,639
backward incompatibility is being

593
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,240
removed or it's broken or something so

594
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,440
the next thing you release is 1 1

595
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,440
0. so then from the point of view of

596
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,520
people that are observing prereleases

597
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,559
the version history goes backwards here

598
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,039
so that's a

599
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,039
point should we allow that or not next

600
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
please

601
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:44,159
when we submit rfcs with yang modules

602
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,159
to ayana ayana has some instructions

603
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,120
about assigning rfc numbers and things

604
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,559
like that

605
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,360
and one of the things that needs to be

606
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,000
added to

607
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,000
rfcs as they're being released is this

608
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,400
statement whether a particular

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,799
release is backwards compatible or

610
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,080
non-backers compatible

611
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,600
and it is of course possible that

612
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,360
ayanna would add this but we feel that's

613
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,360
probably something like

614
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,879
for for itf's purposes anyway that the

615
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,600
young doctors group or something

616
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,799
would be the group to decide about

617
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,000
non-backers change

618
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,520
or whether to call a particular release

619
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
non-backers compatible or not

620
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,840
next please

621
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,080
so the the last question i think this is

622
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,520
is

623
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,879
should we mandate that all

624
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,279
itf published yang modules should have

625
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
this

626
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:51,360
yang semver revision label or not

627
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,080
we cannot mandate that for outside

628
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,918
parties

629
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,678
but we could decide for itf's point of

630
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,400
view should we always have this

631
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:03,679
version number like 2001 300 and so on

632
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:10,960
so any comments on any of these three

633
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:14,960
sticky points

634
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,520
go ahead tom thank you uh tom hill from

635
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,840
bt

636
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,440
i didn't mention that last time um i

637
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,480
have a i have a big problem with

638
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,600
the idea of having one module

639
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,039
um being used for the exports of

640
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,120
telemetry for example

641
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,279
and then wanting to upgrade to a newer

642
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,559
model that has a new feature or

643
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,440
fixes something and it will take

644
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,520
months possibly years to upgrade

645
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,559
thousands of routers

646
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,879
so it is very useful for us to know

647
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,279
if there is any incompatibility between

648
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,080
versions of models

649
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,720
extremely useful and there will also be

650
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,158
you know this is almost a flag as well

651
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,840
for us to be able to say you know

652
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,279
this is going to be a hard convert

653
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
between two models

654
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,880
and we're going to have to put some

655
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,440
effort into converting for

656
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,520
the various consumers of that telemetry

657
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,039
very good i think very few would argue

658
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,760
with that

659
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,879
nobody i heard but the devil comes in

660
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,879
the details so if you are

661
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,559
it would be interesting to hear your

662
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,200
views

663
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,320
more in detail in the tuesdays

664
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,320
discussions that we have because

665
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,520
determining what is backwards compatible

666
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,640
and not compatible

667
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,639
may be somewhat subjective

668
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
understandable

669
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,158
yes i think it's time for bo to take the

670
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,640
next part

671
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,039
kent as a contributor i do agree that it

672
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,600
should be young doctors or

673
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,600
some organization other than anna that

674
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,000
specifies whether or not a module is

675
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,960
backwards compatible

676
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
maybe some tooling could be used if the

677
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,279
tooling was

678
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,600
perfect then i could run the tooling but

679
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:08,480
the young doctor should be the ones that

680
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,480
authorized the tooling

681
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,120
thank you okay so bo

682
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,158
can you let's see rob is

683
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,199
kind of cute thank you

684
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,960
um yes he is go ahead

685
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,960
can i just uh jump in on that that

686
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,480
previous point i i sort of agree where

687
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,399
you're coming from i think the tricky

688
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,600
case is that there are

689
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:36,639
some yang modules that are derived

690
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,760
from other registries i think you have

691
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
like a

692
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,840
one of the bgp ones um is so whenever

693
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,679
they add a new

694
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,360
um i don't know address family or

695
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,360
something to bgp or something like that

696
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,719
then you end up creating a yang module

697
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,959
at the same time

698
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,159
so i think from an i a point of view

699
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,320
there needs to be some consideration

700
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,880
about what happens for those sort of

701
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,480
auto generated yang models and there

702
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
have been some cases

703
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,880
recently where the where there's been a

704
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,320
desire to have some non-banks compatible

705
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,720
changes to those i.e

706
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,080
fixing the description statements or in

707
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,799
some cases even changing some of the

708
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,600
names

709
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,960
so i think that um whilst for most

710
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,959
modules i think i agree

711
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,240
it's the authors or the young doctors

712
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,000
that should be driving this i think

713
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,200
there still needs to be some

714
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,720
tie in with ayanna to make sure

715
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,640
the point is published that it's always

716
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,919
right and we need to work out exactly

717
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,279
how to do that

718
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,279
hopefully tooling can help there

719
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,919
beau the approach presentation took

720
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,320
longer than expected

721
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,360
if possible can you run quickly through

722
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,360
this question i mean

723
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,760
we do have we're a little bit over time

724
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,279
so please go ahead

725
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,760
yeah okay uh i'm just good here to give

726
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,039
some

727
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,840
quick updates on the young packages next

728
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,840
slide please

729
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,918
yeah jen just mentioned

730
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
there's a lot of time spent on package

731
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,480
discussion

732
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,320
but we right now we just made

733
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,200
some changes uh to the other issues

734
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,240
that we currently discussed in the core

735
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,240
meeting

736
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,520
and the the major three parts that

737
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,720
we changed since uh 108

738
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,960
is the first one that we added a new

739
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,440
uh division rule for the package

740
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,720
definition

741
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,240
and then the next one is a new section

742
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,960
that uh just uh

743
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,159
this one is related to rob just and

744
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,919
blush just mentioned

745
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,279
about the different uh sdos

746
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,960
uh deviations handling so this is a new

747
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,520
section to to related to that

748
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
and then it's mainly the editorial

749
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,519
changes

750
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,720
and all the uh discussion is ongoing

751
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,159
and the gcap is the link is below

752
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,919
next please and here's a

753
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,960
the package usage guidance uh

754
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,159
related to just rob and blush mentioned

755
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,360
that uh packages

756
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,240
is recommended to publish for better

757
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,039
interoperability and deviation should be

758
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,200
reserved for

759
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:27,919
implementation rather than specification

760
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
and publishing a package is based on

761
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,039
another

762
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,000
standard package with some division is

763
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,799
very dangerous

764
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,799
because they may lead to some

765
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,879
some cannot be changed

766
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,279
after the publish the standardization

767
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,159
and the public standard should make use

768
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,159
of property

769
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,640
feature statements to provide

770
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,679
flexibility so this is a

771
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,120
the summary of the guideline from that

772
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,880
section

773
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,879
next piece and then uh with the

774
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:08,159
open issues uh we we mainly have the

775
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,440
main uh four uh open issues the first

776
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,039
one is game amount

777
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,039
and packages uh

778
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,159
they also think that it can contain

779
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,960
module with

780
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,559
mount points uh that should be

781
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,600
additional information

782
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,799
for the package to have uh

783
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,158
to to carry some points information

784
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,559
to uh be augmented with like

785
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,320
a list of package could be mounted on

786
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,840
the mount point

787
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:42,240
so so but currently we are still

788
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,199
in the discussion about that so we would

789
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,760
like to hear

790
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,039
more feedback from the working group if

791
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,919
uh

792
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,399
on the mailing list or right now it

793
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,600
could be

794
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,840
uh it could be appreciated

795
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,840
the next piece

796
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,559
and then the weather the package require

797
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,120
the module revision date

798
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,120
right now

799
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,959
we don't mandate that package uh have

800
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,639
the

801
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,640
revision date uh but

802
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,720
uh young allows module without a

803
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,880
revision date so

804
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,000
we we we'd like to hear more feedback

805
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,159
from the working group

806
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,760
whether there could be

807
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,279
some options uh some

808
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,440
some suggestions on this

809
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,919
but there could be some uh issues that

810
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
it could be there be more multiple

811
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,080
versions without

812
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,080
revision identified for some young audio

813
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,840
so next please

814
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,399
then better allow a

815
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:06,240
circular uh young package inclusion uh

816
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,199
with we we discussed this but right now

817
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,639
we don't have

818
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,760
a question

819
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,240
an announcer yet but we think blocking

820
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
circular inclusion may prevent

821
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,359
different groups from independently

822
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
defending their

823
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,119
packages like for example uh give an

824
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,839
example about

825
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:32,639
oem and routing it could be uh

826
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:36,399
could be uh depending on each other but

827
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,040
if we block that then it should be

828
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,399
coordinated between the two working

829
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,679
groups to define those packages

830
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,679
then next please

831
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,240
uh this is the last open issue for this

832
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,759
time

833
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:55,759
and um

834
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,359
we just gave the the guidance but we

835
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,520
think that might

836
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:05,040
be also uh applies to the

837
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,839
one individual young module so

838
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,839
right now we think uh our proposal is a

839
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,640
define new section in the packages drop

840
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,160
to give the

841
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,359
guidelines on the division and

842
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,160
feature usage but right now we we are

843
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
happy to

844
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,000
hear more feedback on this from the

845
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,640
working group

846
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:31,839
so uh that's all the

847
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:35,118
presentation you know

848
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,440
bo a question on the last slide yeah uh

849
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,119
i

850
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,160
did you talk about other alternatives

851
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,280
and the obvious take to 8407 to the

852
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
guidelines

853
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,839
privacy

854
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,880
right now it's in the new section

855
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,879
in the packages draft but

856
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,560
the rob think uh if it's uh

857
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,040
it's in the like the previous uh

858
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,920
published

859
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,480
uh author and young guidelines it could

860
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,119
be

861
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:17,200
um quite uh separate

862
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,680
i mean uh rob can you

863
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,078
add something here i think we will

864
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,520
discuss this

865
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,440
uh yes so i so so lou the answer is yes

866
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,079
we did discuss this that are confirmed

867
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,200
with adding

868
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,800
into the um the yang

869
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,319
author guidelines is currently that

870
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,760
document is focused

871
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,839
on uh only modules so it felt

872
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,680
that and the topic is about um

873
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,520
guidelines for module authors

874
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,960
as to whether that would be overreaching

875
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,680
the scope of that document

876
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,839
but um certainly happy to have a

877
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,879
discussion as to where the best place

878
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,839
is to put that text uh our other focus

879
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,440
was to try and get the text right now

880
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,640
and then worry about later

881
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,960
exactly where it needs to live um and

882
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,040
get the content correct

883
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,320
that that's sensible and we could always

884
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,800
use the updates

885
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,520
approach we're saying that this section

886
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,240
updates

887
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,520
that document so that uh readers of that

888
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,959
document in the future

889
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,960
of 8407 know to look to this new rfc

890
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,480
that makes sense so can i just ask a

891
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,079
separate question

892
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,520
um because i obviously missed a little

893
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,560
bit of the

894
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,400
um of the meeting earlier on

895
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,839
well has there been any discussion about

896
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,000
us holding virtual

897
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,119
interim meetings and is that worth

898
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,400
something that we

899
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,640
should discuss now at all uh we did

900
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,880
mention that that's possible

901
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,560
uh we said that those could be initiated

902
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,839
either by the chairs or at the request

903
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,880
of the working group

904
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,040
uh are you requesting a virtual on this

905
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,400
uh versioning topic is that what you're

906
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,960
where you're headed

907
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,560
uh yes i think so we have discussed this

908
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,480
briefly the last few days between the

909
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,759
authors and they're all quite keen that

910
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
they think that that would be good to

911
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,640
have

912
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
um a few virtual meetings a virtual

913
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,000
interim meeting setting up focusing on

914
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,640
on trying to resolve specific issues so

915
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,599
maybe we can follow up with you on the

916
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,440
chairs

917
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,720
offline and try and get those set up

918
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,760
please

919
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,279
yeah i think that would be uh great and

920
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,920
um

921
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
perhaps yeah we can we can sync up and

922
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,760
maybe send something to the list done

923
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:33,839
some proposed times

924
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,839
okay thank you thank you

925
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,119
hello can you hear me

926
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,240
yes please go ahead okay this channel

927
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,839
i'm here to present the

928
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,078
self describing data object text

929
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,599
java.update

930
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,520
as you can see actually we changed the

931
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,040
title the original term is

932
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,440
self-explanation we think

933
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,480
self-describing is a more common term so

934
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,800
we change that

935
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,800
next

936
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,640
yeah for people who don't know what is

937
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,040
this java about actually

938
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,480
uh this child they define the data

939
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,640
object tag actually

940
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,680
the user tag is actually widely you know

941
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,440
used for classification organization

942
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,118
and not only in the idea protocol but

943
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,680
also in the internet

944
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,640
and uh on module tag actually is one of

945
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,759
example he

946
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,240
provides a young model classification

947
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,800
can classify young model into network

948
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,118
animal

949
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,040
element model and a network service

950
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,200
model user group model

951
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,279
and we borrow the same concept actually

952
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
we introduce self-describing data object

953
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,400
tag

954
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,839
which you can classify the management

955
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,839
and operation data into

956
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,359
several categories from this category we

957
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,799
can identify this

958
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,200
characteristic data so the typical cases

959
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,599
is

960
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,319
using in the streaming animation we can

961
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,320
filter the

962
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,839
query and reduce the amount of data to

963
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,839
export to the client

964
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
next

965
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,399
so uh so what is the current status of

966
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,720
this job that this job has been present

967
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,760
uh

968
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,799
uh for many times actually we

969
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,920
ipr account has on this job has been

970
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,040
issued and we have confirmed and we also

971
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,319
request the working

972
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,319
adoption call on version five and

973
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,440
we got a lot of support and also a lot

974
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,839
of uh

975
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,800
comments and many thanks uh you can

976
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,839
yukon and

977
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,240
many other colleagues and it was a great

978
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,319
uh

979
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,439
suggest actually by the working group

980
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,400
and

981
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,720
for operation operation type maybe

982
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,240
should be defined in specific device

983
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,040
device models such as minimize minimal

984
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,520
value maximum value average value we

985
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,680
think this

986
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,839
makes sense and for this job they should

987
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,040
focus on object specific attack

988
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,599
and which provide the general utility so

989
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,720
in

990
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,680
this latest version version 6 we

991
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,399
actually remove

992
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,879
operation type extension statement and

993
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,520
also we actually remove

994
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,400
other complex tags like a metric

995
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,440
precision

996
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,200
magic scale and

997
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,720
in addition we you know take out a

998
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,520
service attack and uh task attack

999
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,640
extension because for multi-tag actually

1000
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,680
can be reused for

1001
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,359
this same purpose and and we also

1002
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,839
rewrite the use cases

1003
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,720
try to clarify the relationship between

1004
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:25,119
the object

1005
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,919
and the property separation and measure

1006
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,920
object

1007
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,880
and give the example how to use them and

1008
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,599
and we also have some other editorial

1009
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,480
changes

1010
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,480
and next

1011
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,200
next yeah for opm tag actually is the

1012
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,319
key

1013
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,439
component defined in this job so opm tag

1014
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,839
extension statement

1015
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,839
actually used to classify the management

1016
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,160
and operation data into

1017
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,000
object properties sub-object and a

1018
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,359
metric sub-object

1019
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,760
this is three category and in this

1020
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,960
in the left we show the relationship

1021
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,880
between

1022
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,160
these three categories actually you can

1023
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,359
see that one

1024
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,399
object can contain well

1025
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,799
two or many uh property sub objects

1026
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:20,240
and one object can also have one too uh

1027
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,520
many metric sub objects for

1028
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,598
object it usually defined as a

1029
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,599
container or at least leave list for

1030
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,720
property it is

1031
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,680
actually diff node and the magic

1032
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,399
sub object that we think it can can be

1033
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,680
the

1034
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
leave list and list and also can be the

1035
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,078
the leaf

1036
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,200
so in the right we give the example how

1037
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,599
we can tag them uh the data objects are

1038
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,799
defined in the in in the young data

1039
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,079
model for example

1040
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:55,040
we have a tunnel pm model and we have

1041
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,760
tunnel service root node and we also

1042
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,079
have

1043
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,400
name create time and average latency

1044
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,000
as a child child node to the tunnel

1045
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
service router node

1046
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
so we can tag the tunnel services router

1047
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,280
node as ietf

1048
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,640
object and we can tag a name

1049
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,599
as itf property and we also can

1050
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,160
tag the latency which is related to a

1051
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,560
metric

1052
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,560
sub-object as itf metric

1053
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:29,359
next

1054
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,640
so in addition to define uh the con

1055
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,078
the opm tag we also introduced two uh

1056
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,480
context information since

1057
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,720
we already classified the management

1058
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,079
algorithm data into three categories

1059
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,078
which include the

1060
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,119
metric sample object we can use the

1061
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,440
metric group

1062
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,800
to further classify his metric separate

1063
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,920
object

1064
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,400
into for example loss related or cheater

1065
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,319
related and delay related category

1066
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,359
and another context information tag is

1067
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,200
multi-source tag actually this will use

1068
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,920
for the multi-source aggregation

1069
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,879
so we support two different types of

1070
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,200
aggregation type

1071
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,040
one is aggregate the other is no

1072
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,560
aggregator so for aggregate

1073
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,839
type you need to report the aggregate

1074
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:18,720
metric from one of the source

1075
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,759
for no uh aggregate actually you need to

1076
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,879
report

1077
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,880
each matrix sub object from each

1078
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,319
source separately so for these two

1079
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,520
context tags it will be you know defined

1080
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:34,720
in the same level as

1081
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,839
opm tag so we can use tag name to

1082
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,839
distinguish from each other

1083
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,800
next

1084
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
so this chapter has been around for a

1085
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,319
while and we

1086
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,520
already you know got comments from jugen

1087
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,800
and

1088
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,480
we actually addressed his comments in

1089
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,440
this version and we also get a

1090
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,880
confirmation

1091
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,839
of line from jugen and we think

1092
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,400
this chapter is ready for working

1093
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,799
adoption

1094
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,800
thanks

1095
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,200
okay so i'm going to start bringing up

1096
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,720
the next slides but

1097
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,480
if anyone has any comments in that last

1098
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,200
presentation please

1099
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,200
bring to the mic

1100
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,000
who is contributor i did

1101
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,860
ask um a question on the list that

1102
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,359
didn't get answered i'll ask again

1103
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:44,240
[Music]

1104
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,240
and just be interested in seeing the

1105
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,319
response

1106
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,520
yeah yeah i i just say you uh asked this

1107
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,560
question and uh

1108
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,079
we uh actually uh i i see some

1109
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:01,680
colleagues actually uh respond to anna

1110
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,800
uh for for people who are interested

1111
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,680
uh and we uh actually you uh we can

1112
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,839
comment on that

1113
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,839
and get more feedback

1114
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:17,680
thanks

1115
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,119
okay i'm unclear why my computer is

1116
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,078
taking forever to load up the last

1117
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:29,839
slides but

1118
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:29,839
it's just about loaded

1119
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:43,839
okay they're loaded i just need to share

1120
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:43,839
the screen

1121
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,960
okay uh this is ching again and i will

1122
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,200
present

1123
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,359
this easy policy imagine draft update

1124
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,319
and i will try to make sure because we

1125
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,319
run out of time and

1126
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,240
next

1127
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,040
and uh actually what is this job about

1128
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,439
actually

1129
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,319
easy is considered as a special case of

1130
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,920
the policy

1131
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:23,440
management and it includes it comprise

1132
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,800
the event condition

1133
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,480
action three k elements so it can

1134
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,079
enable the event-based management

1135
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,960
provider a

1136
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,559
rapid response to the network events and

1137
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,200
we use a young data model

1138
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,119
language to express these key elements

1139
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,279
in the easy

1140
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,160
policy actually

1141
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,200
this easy can be implemented in two

1142
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,520
different ways

1143
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,598
one is centralized network management

1144
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,400
the second is

1145
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:56,480
device safer management device several

1146
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,760
management can also see as

1147
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,119
distributed uh policy management

1148
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,720
for centralized nano management it can

1149
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,680
provide a nanowide

1150
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,720
visibility to water happening in a

1151
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,839
networker

1152
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,319
but it may require the huge

1153
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,720
resource consumption when facing the

1154
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,599
massive data connection and processing

1155
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,000
and it may have slow reaction to the

1156
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,960
network

1157
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,079
change to address these challenges we

1158
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,440
introduce these

1159
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,680
device server management the idea is

1160
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,640
you can delegate network control to the

1161
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,359
device

1162
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,040
so device can self management do to cell

1163
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:37,440
monitoring separate healing

1164
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,240
and it can provide a quick response to

1165
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,680
the nano event

1166
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:44,720
such as failure or error

1167
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,919
and do the

1168
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,799
telemetry monitoring automatically and

1169
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,960
in some cases

1170
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:56,480
it may require the stata to be stored

1171
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,720
and also require some computation logic

1172
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,000
so one of the example is a smart filter

1173
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,839
yeah we will

1174
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,839
discuss in a later slides next

1175
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,160
so what is the current status of this

1176
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,759
job these jobs actually

1177
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,839
has been around for a while it's

1178
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,880
harmonized with several

1179
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:20,200
com problems easy related

1180
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,599
work and we present in

1181
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,319
106 and we

1182
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,200
actually get agreed to adopt this worker

1183
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,800
and i suggest

1184
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,439
to define this model uh more independent

1185
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,960
from the

1186
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:38,079
nether comp protocol so we

1187
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,559
did a request uh working with dobson on

1188
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,280
version six and uh we got a lot of

1189
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,400
comments and

1190
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,200
also there's some concern on this essay

1191
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,160
model design

1192
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,240
so it was suggested to use expats for

1193
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:53,520
logical expression

1194
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,160
and also it was suggested to use

1195
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,720
combination of x paths policy variable

1196
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,520
new

1197
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,959
xpath function and to bind this is a

1198
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,400
common to

1199
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:08,119
scripting language so we

1200
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:12,160
actually after uh ietf for

1201
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:14,559
100 107

1202
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,759
meeting actually we uh discussed with

1203
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,720
many problems

1204
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,000
and we also get andy on board and uh

1205
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,720
discussed with

1206
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,599
many other companies like eager hank

1207
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,040
chevron

1208
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,880
and void and we set up some conference

1209
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,240
meeting to discuss this issue we also

1210
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,760
exchanged email

1211
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,799
offline and actually latest version we

1212
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,440
get a review by uh jonathan

1213
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,440
but you only focus on some abstract

1214
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,240
section or introduction section

1215
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,359
so in the latest version we make a lot

1216
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,919
of changes

1217
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,558
the big changes will rewrite as a easy

1218
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,680
model

1219
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:54,880
uh usage use usage example

1220
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,359
we also added two new uh usage example

1221
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,920
one is

1222
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,000
related to the cpu utilization shop

1223
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,040
shooting the second is really to the

1224
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,319
root log thumb and uh

1225
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,960
and based on the discussion and uh

1226
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,839
many this discussion we think it's more

1227
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,559
reasonable to

1228
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,440
reintroduce some function called rpc

1229
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,640
core

1230
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,640
and to allow his

1231
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:23,279
computation logic to work and

1232
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,879
and we also move the notification

1233
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
operation as separate

1234
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,280
uh notification since we believe the

1235
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:32,400
notification is changed between

1236
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,280
the uh remote client and the server

1237
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,359
and also we add is a function library

1238
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,599
list in the essay model

1239
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,598
next

1240
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,319
so to make sure everybody on the same

1241
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,079
page actually

1242
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,440
will introduce several terminal

1243
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,599
terminologies

1244
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,520
the key technology we introduce is easy

1245
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,760
event it will

1246
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,559
use a capture the telemetry subscription

1247
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,839
data source

1248
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:05,280
use this as input to the easy logic

1249
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,920
and for events uh stream subsequently we

1250
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,599
introduce

1251
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,800
server event which can uh trigger

1252
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:16,079
to generator notification for

1253
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,880
uh event stream subscription for

1254
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:21,119
data store subscription we introduce a

1255
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
datastore event which can trigger

1256
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,720
the notification to be generated for

1257
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,440
datastore subscription

1258
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,240
we also introduce a timer event and a

1259
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,160
diagnostic

1260
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,759
event the timer event actually can

1261
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,839
allow you to call the ese logic

1262
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,280
periodically which is similar to the

1263
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:40,640
crown job

1264
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,520
task management for a diagnostic

1265
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,400
event actually it were used to test the

1266
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,960
easy logic

1267
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,200
logic to make sure it works properly

1268
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,200
next

1269
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,319
so what is the use cases for these

1270
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,640
several

1271
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,000
device separate management so in the

1272
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,839
next we introduce this

1273
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,960
architecture so the easy model will

1274
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:10,000
be populated in the server the server

1275
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:12,400
will act as a local client to

1276
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,760
do the safer management it will keep

1277
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,480
track of the data

1278
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,000
object change and will trigger the

1279
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,680
action

1280
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,079
when a certain condition to be met

1281
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:28,720
and so we have several use cases

1282
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,000
the typical use case is a smart filter

1283
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,240
which actually

1284
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,880
will use the server event and

1285
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,000
in this case actually for example you

1286
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,800
can scan

1287
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,319
specific type of interface every five

1288
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,880
seconds and you can check the counter

1289
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,000
status

1290
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,119
and return an area of the interface

1291
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,359
entries that match the search in this

1292
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,640
case we may need to store some data for

1293
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:55,680
example you can

1294
00:53:52,640 --> 00:54:00,400
check whether the same event occur

1295
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,078
twice so you need to define some

1296
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,839
variable we call the policy variable to

1297
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,200
store this state

1298
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:09,759
and another case is is

1299
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,359
about the cpu utilization

1300
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,680
troubleshooting actually

1301
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,119
this actually doesn't require any state

1302
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,078
to be stored

1303
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,960
uh for example when cpu utilizing

1304
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,839
utilization

1305
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,839
goes beyond 60

1306
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,920
and you can output a stack cpu fan

1307
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,720
uh information to the flash and then we

1308
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,760
also introduce a timer-based event and a

1309
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,759
diagnostic event for timer event

1310
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,920
for example you can use the watchdog to

1311
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:43,520
dump the router log every

1312
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,640
three minutes to the flash so diagnostic

1313
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:48,000
event just used to test the easy logic

1314
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,118
freedom of smart field

1315
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,839
logic to make sure it worked properly

1316
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:53,839
next

1317
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:58,000
so this is how we design this easy model

1318
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,359
actually you can see

1319
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,559
the key elements for easy model is

1320
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,240
event conditioning and action and

1321
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,400
in addition we introduce a policy

1322
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,040
variable this policy variable

1323
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:13,440
can be used to store some global state

1324
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,160
or temporary state

1325
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,920
in some cases you need to multiple step

1326
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,558
interaction between the local client and

1327
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,400
server

1328
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,480
you can use this policy variable to

1329
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,680
store this state

1330
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,200
and also we

1331
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,839
actually you know model their

1332
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,399
relationship for example for each esa

1333
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:37,119
entry

1334
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:40,640
we will conclude one event that can

1335
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,280
also contain multiple condition action

1336
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,319
pairs

1337
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,599
for each connection action pairs it will

1338
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,558
include

1339
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,480
multiple conditions and one action

1340
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,520
therefore one action

1341
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,079
can it can have multiple action items

1342
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:58,319
this is how we design this easy model

1343
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,319
next

1344
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,960
so here's a typical example you may need

1345
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,078
to

1346
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,839
suppress some duplicate event

1347
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:13,680
for example for internet status down

1348
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:17,520
you without easy logic you may send this

1349
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,520
event multiple times and so

1350
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,079
with the easy logic we can design you

1351
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:25,200
can you can subscribe this

1352
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,799
uh freedom interface model to

1353
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:32,000
uh to to satisfy specific type of

1354
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:32,559
interface and and you can scan uh or

1355
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,799
interf

1356
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,559
internet interface check whether the

1357
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,799
interface stats is done

1358
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,920
uh also you can create the event

1359
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:42,640
occurrence

1360
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,440
counter to keep track of the occurrence

1361
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,879
of the same

1362
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:50,640
event if it uh happen uh

1363
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,079
you know if if the occurrence time you

1364
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,160
see the uh

1365
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:56,000
pre-configure the threshold you will

1366
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,839
suppress the event

1367
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,839
and next

1368
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,240
so how easy logic works so our idea is

1369
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:07,119
we will

1370
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,558
extract the standard policy variable

1371
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,559
from the event

1372
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,640
and then we can map this policy variable

1373
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,240
into the x-pass

1374
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:20,000
variables and and then we can evaluate

1375
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,720
this easy x-path uh it may be evaluated

1376
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,880
to be

1377
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,640
false so we can raise the e-say

1378
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,760
exception

1379
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,558
if the expanse evaluator is true and we

1380
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,319
can

1381
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:35,440
jump to the easy uh action execution

1382
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,558
triggers uh uh appropriate action to be

1383
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,240
executed

1384
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:42,960
if the action is executed

1385
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,839
you know not successfully we will raise

1386
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,200
the easy

1387
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,480
uh exception again if it can be executed

1388
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,879
successfully we uh we may uh trigger to

1389
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,240
send

1390
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,559
the event notification uh to the to the

1391
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,439
remote client

1392
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,480
so for smart field cases you can see

1393
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:03,760
actually we

1394
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:06,960
introduced two uh policy variable we can

1395
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,960
use the event repeater counter to keep

1396
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:14,240
track of the uh the the

1397
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,520
the duplicated event the um occurrence

1398
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,000
time and we also

1399
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,559
you know uh define the interface statics

1400
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
event

1401
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:25,119
and to uh to keep track of the

1402
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,200
status down uh interface so

1403
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:32,000
also we can map to this condition we can

1404
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,680
uh enumerate all the condition and we

1405
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,960
can design

1406
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,319
the easy logic in the left

1407
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,960
and we can make it a worker actually

1408
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:42,960
uh next

1409
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,000
uh i don't want to you know repeat all

1410
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,359
these issues because i

1411
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,760
already post all these four issues

1412
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,200
on the list i haven't got feedback and

1413
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,240
actually all these issues

1414
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,040
we already you know addressed in this uh

1415
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,640
draft and we want to hear your feedback

1416
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,480
and

1417
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:10,400
can you go back uh can you uh

1418
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,400
move to to the last slide

1419
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:20,319
yeah uh yeah am i on the right side now

1420
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,440
yeah yeah correct maybe move to the last

1421
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,200
slide because

1422
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,040
all these four issues i already raised

1423
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,720
on the list haven't get feedback

1424
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,319
maybe yeah people can take a look at

1425
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:31,118
that and and

1426
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,680
uh so we will keep on to improve this

1427
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:36,799
job

1428
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,799
and i want to hear your feedback

1429
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,040
okay so um as chair we're

1430
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,680
pretty much at the end of the meeting

1431
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,759
now but um you said that you wanted to

1432
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,759
take some things to the list

1433
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:56,640
and should that be done prior to

1434
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,640
call for adoption

1435
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,559
yeah just to make sure everybody you

1436
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,200
know

1437
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,480
uh raise this open issue and uh actually

1438
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,598
we already addressed this

1439
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:11,040
urban issue this just gave the update

1440
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:14,079
i think uh we we also believe it's

1441
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,920
ready to go for adoption and

1442
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,880
if anybody can raise addiction comments

1443
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,880
we are welcome

1444
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:25,040
okay but would you prefer to

1445
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,200
check to make sure the issues have been

1446
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,160
resolved prior to starting adoption or

1447
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,040
did you just want to

1448
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,040
go into adoption

1449
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:40,640
an adoption call yeah intention is a

1450
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:44,399
request adoption call okay i

1451
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,558
say this because um it would be

1452
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,400
this these two drafts have both been up

1453
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,119
for adoption before

1454
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,920
and i think that there's i don't know if

1455
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,799
it's an official

1456
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,319
or whatever rule but um there's no rule

1457
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,000
but you know it's kind of the

1458
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,160
case that if something's come up to the

1459
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,920
bat multiple times and

1460
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,680
it never you know there's no interest

1461
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,480
then it gets dropped

1462
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,640
um so it may be better to try to resolve

1463
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,799
any you know to ensure that

1464
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,078
issues have been resolved prior to us

1465
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,240
taking it to adoption

1466
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,520
because if that adoption fails then it

1467
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,240
might be um

1468
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:19,680
difficult to bring up interest you know

1469
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,799
this again

1470
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:24,319
so yeah actually the

1471
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,240
the concern raised actually by the

1472
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:29,279
eugene i did check the uh

1473
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,000
uh you can actually about previous job

1474
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,040
there and

1475
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,119
he seems okay for the second job that we

1476
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,240
work together with andy and uh

1477
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:41,119
i think uh probably

1478
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,319
yeah we we can discuss with andy if andy

1479
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,119
has some

1480
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:45,119
comments on these

1481
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,480
are there open comments or the comments

1482
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:53,280
are resolved

1483
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,640
yeah all the comments you know the four

1484
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,760
issue released here

1485
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:01,598
already are resolved in this version

1486
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,599
and yeah

1487
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,520
okay then i think then uh what i'm

1488
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,079
hearing you say is that you'd like to

1489
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,440
uh have the adoption call initiated for

1490
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,200
these two drafts

1491
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,720
um that all the issues have been

1492
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:19,520
addressed and so

1493
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,279
the chairs can initiate that and we'll

1494
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,000
see how it goes okay

1495
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,000
okay thank you

1496
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:29,038
okay so um we're a little bit over time

1497
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,960
but it concludes our meeting

1498
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,480
uh thank you everyone for joining in the

1499

comments shared

1500
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,599
uh we'll be posting minutes as soon as

1501
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,480
we

1502
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,640
have the time to do that and follow up

1503
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,520
