00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,239
not sure exactly what's going on but at

50
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239

59
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840

75
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,840
okay right now

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,799
okay let's try this okay so this is the

77
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:22,400
agenda um so we'll get to this

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
draft scene for that we'll look at the

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
current working group status

80
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,120
so

81
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,960
yeah so we have the msdp young model

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,440
that got published

83
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,880
that's great news and we got some more

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,680
young models coming

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,960
um both the pygmyang model and

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,440
models the sleeping and models should be

87
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,799
published soon i think it's mostly a

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,560
matter of waiting for

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,880
references um

90
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,039
so that's the good news the bad news is

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
we have a couple of drafts that we

92
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,599
requested publication for but the eddy

93
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,639
returned them to us

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,639
so one is the dr improvement draft

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
so there were i think there are various

96
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,440
editorial things or things that needed

97
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,679
to be clarified

98
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,719
also in part one particular thing was

99
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,000
the relationship

100
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,000
between this and the um backup dr draft

101
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
so we yeah there is some text to try to

102
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,400
address

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,360
that but it seems like we may need some

104
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,880
more discussion or clarification

105
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,440
so um we don't have an update

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
just yet

107
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,960
earlier before addressing some of the ad

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
comments but

109
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,318
since it was returned to the working

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,599
group we have yeah

111
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,520
some more updates um

112
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,159
so yeah i guess we'll discuss that

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,719
next meeting or hopefully we can do some

114
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880

imp mld extension

143
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,839
um otherwise we have an assert packing

144
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,279
draft that

145
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
expired hoping i'll get a new version of

146
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,000
that soon

147
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:49,040
um there was a new

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,620
submission for the um routing

149
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,040
quantum multi-punch policy draft

150
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,640
[Music]

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,839
so please have a look at that

152
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,920
so we actually the original plan was to

153
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,560
present it to the april that's not going

154
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,680
to happen

155
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,959
but meeting materials

156
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,079
looking at those also

157
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,800
we did this survey

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,120
to progress again viewers and cmld

159
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
version 2 so we got lots of input

160
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,160
and there's a draft that summarizes the

161
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,680
input we got

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,839
so based on that we have some idea

163
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,839
about what people have deployed

164
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,839
basically the various features or

165
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,360
elements of these rfcs

166
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
you know a bit more what people have

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
deployed

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
about interval ability of the issues

169
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:54,240
based on that we want to

170
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,719
revise this rfcs so basically

171
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
the idea is to remove any parts that are

172
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
not used

173
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
or

174
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,640
if you have a few people that were

175
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,720
working on this

176
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,480
previously that are still interested in

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,279
working on this but if anyone wants to

178
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,279
join the effort

179
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,839
um i can send an email

180
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,239
your audio is still struggling pretty

181
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,880
bad stick

182
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,079
oh it's good it's going to go in but um

183
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,839
okay

184
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,680
now it sounds great right now but it

185
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,120
just every

186
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,410
30 seconds or so it just tanks

187
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
let me try one thing i'll try to

188
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,839
[Music]

189
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,839
stop my

190
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,600
actually

191
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:15,839
hopefully that doesn't work

192
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,399
yeah hello maybe this is better that's a

193
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,600
lot better yeah maybe just

194
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,800
there you go okay

195
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
let me reshare my screen what's the

196
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,279
difference just not sharing video is

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,120
that the only difference

198
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,320
uh i was using vpn so the

199
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,680
um yeah so the forwarding path

200
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,959
wasn't optimal let's see

201
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,000
um okay so hopefully it will be fine now

202
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,839
um so yeah so

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
i don't want to repeat all of this but

204
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,079
basically we

205
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,319
have this draft with a survey report you

206
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,760
can see at the bottom of the slide

207
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,240
so please have a look at that and um

208
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
we want people that can help to work on

209
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,079
progressing

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,800
the rgmp and mld specs to internet

211
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,880
standard

212
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,240
i'll send an email to the list with some

213
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,920
more details but

214
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,279
we discussed this in the past so

215
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,719
basically

216
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,200
you want to not like add new protocol

217
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
stuff but basically take some stuff out

218
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,519
if it's not implemented or used

219
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:53,680
and fixed imperability issues and so on

220
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:56,959
alright any questions or comments

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,560
all right so anything to add mike or

222
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
shall we start with the first

223
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,839
presentation

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,200
i think we should start all right

225
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,360
so yeah which is me let's see here if i

226
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,360
can

227
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:21,839
um okay we don't have that up

228
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:35,839
okay i wonder how this looks let's see

229
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
um

230
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
okay that didn't go as smoothly as i

231
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,639
hoped

232
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,120
all right

233
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,600
we see it though yeah all right great

234
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
okay so um

235
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,279
yeah i've been presenting this a few

236
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,399
meetings now um

237
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:33,680
so basically want some generic way of

238
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,680
extending rgmp and mld adding some tlvs

239
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:41,279
so what this draft does is talk about

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
how to extend the protocol defining the

241
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,680
tlv

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,240
formats on well not exactly not the tlvs

243
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,839
themselves

244
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:53,600
but basically how the tlv approach works

245
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,079
um and also

246
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,279
it talks about backwards compatibility

247
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,839
and things that

248
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
new documents well any documents that

249
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,079
define your types

250
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,359
what they need to specify so

251
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,120
for instance you need to and any

252
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,680
document defining a new type needs to

253
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,480
have some discussion about

254
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,920
backwards compatibility what if some

255
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,720
some hosts or routers

256
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,160
on the subnet supports the new tlb and

257
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
some downtime

258
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,040
and various other things so it calls out

259
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,079
what those documents need to

260
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,079
need to support um

261
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,439
let's see uh for the the format itself

262
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,079
it's the same as

263
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,600
a presented the last meeting so it is we

264
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,199
are using the um

265
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,800
additional data section of igmp and mld

266
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,120
so basically we have a

267
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,959
restart bit the e you can see in blue

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,680
here that indicates that this

269
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,719
extension is being used and then the

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
blue at the bottom

271
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,440
is where the additional data is that

272
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,560
will contain these tlbs

273
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,519
and the tlv format

274
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,160
is like this so this comes basically at

275
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,440
the end

276
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,800
of um comes after what is currently

277
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,880
in the imp or mld message

278
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,758
so it's just a list of tlbs um

279
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,120
there is some restored bits and a total

280
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,639
extension length

281
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,320
and then there is like each tle uh

282
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,839
maybe i shouldn't go too much into this

283
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,279
because we discussed this the last

284
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,040
meeting but

285
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,240
one reason for the total extension

286
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,800
length is that we can

287
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
just like current rgmp and mld protocols

288
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,959
we can allow

289
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
for additional additional data coming

290
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,479
after this

291
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
so so the total length here will

292
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,880
basically tell you

293
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,360
when you have when these tlvs end

294
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
so that if there's any data after this

295
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,519
they won't be

296
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,920
treated as yet another tlv

297
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,800
so they can be any additional data for

298
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,599
future

299
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:08,879
protocol enhancements um

300
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,559
so uh last itf

301
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
the main comment was that there should

302
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,918
be some more discussion in the draft

303
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,959
about

304
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
um how to use this and compatibility and

305
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,280
so on and i

306
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,599
tried to address that so and most of

307
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,520
that is basically saying

308
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,958
what what the drafts that actually

309
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,840
define specific

310
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,840
types need to need to specify

311
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,679
so any comments

312
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,600
yeah so personally i feel that uh i'm

313
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
pretty much finished with this draft at

314
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,399
least uh

315
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
um i've done what i i i can think of

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,320
adding to it

317
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,080
so um to make any progress

318
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,960
i feel either i need some comments or

319
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,399
or maybe everyone is happy with it we'll

320
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
see but

321
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,320
i think it would be good to the working

322
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,799
group last call if the

323
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,039
chairs the working group are happy with

324
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,039
that

325
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,240
i'm going to do a little

326
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,840
hole real quick and see if it works if

327
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,840
anybody cares

328
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,000
well take this to the list but i'm just

329
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,480
gonna

330
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,320
yeah i think i can raise i think i'll

331
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,760
raise my own hand here

332
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
yeah why not

333
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,200
we'll give it a minute yeah what i maybe

334
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,760
should add is the motivation for this

335
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,720
right now is

336
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,000
a beer overlay or i should say igmp mld

337
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,640
overlay for beer

338
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,840
where we want to pass some additional

339
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
beer info

340
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,879
but this is generic so we you can use it

341
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,600
for

342
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
to add anything else in the future but

343
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,439
any extensions need to go through the

344
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,640
working group the way it's specified now

345
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,960
so

346
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,440
it's not like everyone can just go and

347
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,440
extend whatever they want

348
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
we need to be a bit careful about what

349
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
extensions we do because of the

350
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
compatibility

351
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,160

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
nice swiss

394
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,919
and this is the second version for the

395
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,799
presentation

396
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,799
as the goku draft nice piece

397
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,280
here we talked about how

398
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,080
about two updates about this draft

399
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
first one we change the feature name

400
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
from the

401
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,320
uh feature itmp proxy to

402
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,600
hmp proxy because we have checked

403
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,280
some related uh young modules and this

404
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,399
keyword feature

405
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,799
always doesn't use the in the teacher

406
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,000
name

407
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,000
so we made this change next piece

408
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,039
i stay yes yes sorry

409
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,559
okay yeah okay okay similarly we

410
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:20,799
also renamed the feature the feature

411
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:25,840
uh node policy to mld proxy

412
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,840
as similar as the agmt plus next piece

413
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,480
the second update we

414
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:40,080
renamed the leaf version in the

415
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,720
hmt proxy tree to hmp version

416
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,399
so uh because we think the this keyword

417
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,520
igmp version is

418
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,559
more accurate uh below is the

419
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:55,039
whole identifier tree

420
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,039
now a nice please

421
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
similarly we also renamed the deep

422
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,520
version in the

423
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,919
mld proxy 3 to

424
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:14,320
the mlt version below is the

425
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:19,840
current mld proxy tree here

426
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,840
okay very nice

427
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:32,480
okay next time we think this software is

428
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,880
ready for the younger autos review and

429
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,600

490
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,080
yeah good thank you okay great

491
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,960
hello everyone today i'm going to talk

492
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,080
about the

493
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:46,720
srv6.2 multiple in the path

494
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,720
next page

495
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,000
so compared to the previous version

496
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,399
we we just have some updates first we

497
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,919
have

498
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,279
some kind of editorial changes

499
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,480
and secondly and mostly uh we

500
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,159
add some details about behaviors on the

501
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,720
english node and the transient node

502
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,720
next page

503
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,360
so the behavior is about the english

504
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,639
node

505
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,279
so on the english node english node will

506
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,600
receive

507
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:31,120
as a segment list this segment list

508
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,120
represents an sr p20p

509
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,320
path or subtree for example

510
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,158
for the for the sr

511
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,439
p to p path in the fig below

512
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,960
so we have a segment list

513
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:53,840
for the sub 3 from p1 to p2

514
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:57,039
p3 and l1 l2 and pp4 and

515
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,439
l3 and l4 so

516
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,640
so this segment is because this is for

517
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,320
multi uh

518
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:09,600
p2mp pass so

519
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:15,360
inside this segment list is the

520
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:20,399
multicast s ids for each of this node

521
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,399
so with this given segment list

522
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,879
the english node r will

523
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:31,039
execute in caps for

524
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:34,480
input segment list

525
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,679
and a package so this package has a data

526
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,120
or

527
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,159
as a as a payload

528
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,279
so this in-cap will push

529
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,720
segment list into the package pack

530
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,640
packet zero and then we have a new

531
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,919
package

532
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,600
packet packet a prime so in fact

533
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,039
this new package is the output

534
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:06,399
of execution of this in-cap with input

535
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,399
segment list and packet 0.

536
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,799
so after we have this a new package

537
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,799
packet prime

538
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,559
then this english will send this package

539
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,320
to

540
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,879
the max hop for example lex or p1

541
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,918
so in fact this new package packet of

542
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,720
prime

543
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,440
contains that segment released given

544
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,440
the next page

545
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,799
so for for each transition node

546
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
the trencher node will receive a package

547
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:45,600
like a package

548
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,959
pm prime for example from english node

549
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,000
or from another transient node so this

550
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,519
package

551
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,840
will contain a second list

552
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,960
so this second list in fact represents

553
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:05,678
the subtree from the node

554
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,720
receiving the package

555
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,399
so this transit node will copy

556
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:16,320
the date or package zero in that package

557
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:20,799
and then it will also obtain

558
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,399
the second list for sub trees

559
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,360
or say nice hops that next vlog will be

560
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,959
the subject of the

561
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:32,000
uh the root of the snap trees

562
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,000
and then use this uh

563
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,678
use this new segment list

564
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:43,279
for that subtree and then the packet

565
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,200
packet at zero as a payload

566
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,640
the transit node will eq

567
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,440
in cap with this input and then generate

568
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,080
new packages and listen to the legs hop

569
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,080
for example

570
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,039
on a transitional p1 p1

571
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,158
will receive a package

572
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,280
packet package m prime which is sent

573
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,159
from the english node

574
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,040
so this package will contain as segment

575
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,960
list so this second release

576
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,960
we have destination which is a p1

577
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,320
so from this p1 p1 and p1

578
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,679
m which is a multicast id this modicus

579
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,960
id

580
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:34,079
has information about how many branches

581
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,679
or subjects do we have so here

582
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,520
the information indicates that we have

583
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,960
two branches

584
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,399
one starts from p2 the other starts from

585
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,720
p3

586
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,759
so from this information we can get a

587
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,199
two uh

588
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,879
segment list y is for sub 3

589
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:55,918
started from p2 so which is which is the

590
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,200
yellow highlight with yellow that's

591
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:02,799
the segment list for sub 3

592
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,799
started from p2

593
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,720
we we have another sub tree which is

594
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,839
start from p3

595
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,839
so the second disk for this sub 3

596
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,480
is highlighted with red

597
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,839
so we can get a two segment list and

598
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,520
then

599
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:24,799
each is for one sub trees

600
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:29,119
and then use this segment list

601
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,839
with the and also the

602
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,960
packet package zero which is data as a

603
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,480
payload

604
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,560
as an input over in cap and then we

605
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,680
do the in-cap and then generate a new

606
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,560
package for p2

607
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,839
and then we send it this new package to

608
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,119
knightscore p2

609
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,000
similarly we have a second list

610
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
or another subtree which is the subject

611
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,400
started from this

612
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,280
p3 and then we use this segment list

613
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:02,480
and also the data pack zero as an input

614
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,440
and then execute the end cap and then

615
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,560
this in-cap will generate a new package

616
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,880
we call the package p3 and then this

617
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:16,799
will translate p1 this new package to

618
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,160
the microsoft p3 this is the

619
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:27,040
behavior on the transfer node

620
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:29,839
so next page

621
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,480
yeah i think that's all about this uh

622
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,960
update

623
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,839
so basically we update uh get more

624
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,880
details

625
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,400
about behaviors on the english node

626
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,880
and the traditional

627
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
so i would like to request requests for

628
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,720
adoption

629
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:54,320
so any comments go ahead yeah i see we

630
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,480
have a comp yeah ac here

631
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
let's say c line of cisco systems is

632
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,520
this uh

633
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,480
i'm i i i don't know this for sure

634
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,359
but is this the first time that this

635
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,880
behavior for this forwarding behaviors

636
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,119
being described for the sr

637
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,320
uh i mean for the point to multi-point

638
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,359
tree sr is that

639
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,400
described someplace else i think uh in

640
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,400
the first version

641
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,599
in zero version we also describe the

642
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,680
phone behaviors

643
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,079
but this one i just will give more

644
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,319
details

645
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,160
oh oh i okay but there isn't another

646
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
document so this is the first time this

647
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,839
is

648
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,720
the second act there's a second uh no

649
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,240
but i mean this is

650
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,240
this there isn't a stand there isn't

651
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,720
another there isn't a spring document or

652
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,078
anything that defines this

653
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,399
no no no no no yeah so this is uh

654
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,640
yeah so this is new okay that's what i

655
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,640
thought

656
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,960
so there are other documents right on

657
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,119
srv6

658
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,480
but i guess what is new in this document

659
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,320
is the

660
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,800
trying to define the whole tree

661
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,240
basically inside the packet

662
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,599
right so you're you're you're doing it

663
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,520
at the ingress and you have a new type

664
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:14,160
of forwarding behavior to process

665
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,160
this all these nested subtrees

666
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,560
yes so basically those trace structure

667
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,920
is encoded

668
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:33,839
in those multicast sids

669
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:33,839
yeah i understood it understood

670
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,880
yes absolutely

671
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,359
sorry as an author yeah

672
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,160
um this the the pim working group has

673
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,959
already adopted a

674
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:54,240
draft to do something similar

675
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,119
and it does create state in the network

676
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,598
which is fine

677
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,880
we think it's a good solution and what

678
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,400
we're presenting here is just another

679
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,280
solution specifically for srv6 that is

680
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
more sr

681
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,720
like where you're not having to create

682
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,640
like a

683
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,078
replication segment and you're

684
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,118
you're making it uh very

685
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:23,040
similar to segment routing

686
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,040
at least we think so okay

687
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,640
yeah so uh um as the working group

688
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,319
participant

689
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,279
um i think the main main thing

690
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:40,000
i'm wondering about with this is um

691
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,240
basically how you know how efficiently

692
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,800
can you do this

693
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,598
do you think that router would be able

694
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,520
to do this in hardware do the necessary

695
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:55,520
operations or yeah i think so because uh

696
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,079
srv6 we have a lot of the code of

697
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
programming

698
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,640
and then those you see those ids each

699
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,400
each type of id is with a support

700
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,680
associated with a part of a code

701
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,440
pursuit code so don't pursue the code

702
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,720
i think is a we have flexibilities

703
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,280
to do to do the

704
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,399
those kind of work or procedures or

705
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,599
behaviors

706
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,200
we described in this document

707
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:29,839
okay but it is a valid concern to have

708
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,000
you know a growing segment list which is

709
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,319
a general concern for segment routing in

710
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,319
general

711
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,319
yes i think uh last time we were uh

712
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,440
someone also

713
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,560
uh request the

714
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,520
maybe the size of the those at least

715
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,160
is big i think that we i think there are

716
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,440
some

717
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,240
uh solutions for example we can

718
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,760
use a sub tree for each we even better

719
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,919
segment this is too big

720
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,560
and then we can split to into sub trees

721
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,119
that's one uh one solution another

722
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,680
solution

723
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,440
because right now people working on

724
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,839
comparisons of

725
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,040
of sids so that may also

726
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
reduce these concerns

727
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:27,520
uh aac are you trying to speak or

728
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:31,280
did we not remove your old requests

729
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,839
i i just forgot to remove it okay

730
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,839
uh ian

731
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,280
yeah i would like to reinforce the

732
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,000
question that was just asked and asked

733
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,839
that

734
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,839
some worked examples get provided

735
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,839
i i'm skeptical even with the

736
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,440
application of microsit

737
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,680
this is going to be something that is

738
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,400
generally

739
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,520
amenable to being implemented across a

740
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,119
decent range of

741
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,960
existing hardware i'm not i'm not saying

742
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,240
it can't i'm just skeptical i can't

743
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,680
imagine

744
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,598
uh the the the manipulations required

745
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,240
it's it's the the way the document is

746
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,000
laid out it's very abstract

747
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,279
so because list size

748
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,160
absolutely um and and the operations

749
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,480
required

750
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:35,200
in a given

751
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,200
point of uh multicasting

752
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,040
yeah i think from my point of view i

753
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,240
think because

754
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,200
those uh structure is very fixed

755
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,439
for example the number of branches

756
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,439
that's a fixed field

757
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,640
then from that fixed field we can get

758
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,640
the those sub trees

759
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,680
you see the for example when

760
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,960
trying to know to receive a package and

761
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,078
then the second

762
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,480
second list we can access those second

763
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,680
releases in in the header

764
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,560
and also destination is in the oh

765
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,720
we can also in the this header we have

766
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,759
destination those one will process

767
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,118
for each of our hardware can process uh

768
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,480
those destinations

769
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,240
so in these destinations because segment

770
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,440
routing id six v6 ids

771
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,640
they have argument argument functions

772
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,960
those are the arguments and the

773
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,359
functions i think hardware

774
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,560
should access those arguments because

775
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,960
for

776
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,119
that's the common sense for argument in

777
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,200
the sids of

778
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,920
for six for srv6 right

779
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,919
yeah so i

780
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,160
i think i understand it i just it would

781
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,920
be nice to see some

782
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:08,480
some concrete worked examples that's all

783
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:11,440
and i'll mic at this point all right

784
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
greg is next

785
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,040
greg

786
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,640
there you go sorry about that i was i

787
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,920
thought you'd unmute me yeah i want to

788
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,118
just second everything we've said about

789
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,000
in terms of uh you know

790
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,119
examples of scale processing um the

791
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,599
examples let me

792
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,359
help maybe articulate a bit

793
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,040
look at a real network see what the

794
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,880
distribution scale really is

795
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,960
let's take a look at what the transport

796
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,359
tax is in a real deployment and see what

797
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,400
we're really talking about here in scale

798
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,598
because i recall an ietf

799
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,079
wow late 90s in pim

800
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,640
where we're kind of doing the same thing

801
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,760
each

802
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,078
member join we just add to the header

803
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
its destination ip address until the

804
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,359
thing just got massive

805
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,920
so it becomes unbounded at some point

806
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,839
right and this idea of making a subtree

807
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,040
if your header is too big you send two

808
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,119
packets

809
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,119
i mean we already are at a point where

810
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,200
transport tax is massive so

811
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,480
again we can speculate you can speculate

812
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,000
we're asking for examples

813
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,839
show us what a real network would look

814
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
like operating on this and we can see

815
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:33,839
what the packer really looks like and

816
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:33,839
get an idea of scale

817
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,720
is a can be smaller right

818
00:45:50,640 --> 00:46:01,839
again you you haven't fixed the problem

819
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:01,839
just spread it around

820
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,640
yeah another thing that because right

821
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,799
now there's a work going on

822
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,480
in the spring group they propose uh

823
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,920
comparisons of uh

824
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,200
sick ids sids so that also will

825
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,240
re resolve this complete problem

826
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,240
partially i think

827
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,240
not just you've got to define the entire

828
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,160
tree in the packet

829
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,598
that doesn't compress this compression

830
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,440
this citizen help that at all

831
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,359
you still have to define all of your

832
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,760
branch and end points in the packet

833
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,839
it's explicit definition of an entire

834
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,160
tree

835
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,240
yeah i think that's uh the binance of

836
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,640
either we put uh

837
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,839
those uh information or space in the

838
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,799
package or in the

839
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,759
network i think that's the beauty of a

840
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,839
second routine

841
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,200
so sigma routine put a whole path in the

842
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,359
package and then we

843
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,319
we get rid of the states in the network

844
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,400
right

845
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,839
well that that's one view i mean we can

846
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,280
argue that today i don't think it's the

847
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,880
right place but you can say you're

848
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,240
overloading something or it's beautiful

849
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,560
because you put it in one place

850
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,000
but there's also service separation if

851
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,720
you think about the history of how these

852
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,720
technologies

853
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,720
evolved oftentimes they come out of the

854
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,480
gate all smashed together and we realize

855
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
how complex that is and we break it up

856
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,640
so we can bound these problems into sets

857
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,240
and have them work in nice layers and

858
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,160
then this comes around again

859
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,839
so give us some examples and let us see

860
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,839
where this goes thank you

861
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,720
good points part of what oymo's

862
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,839
describing is that

863
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,359
your points can be generally described

864
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,759
against segment routing in general and

865
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:38,880
not

866
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,119
specific to this draft i know this draft

867
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,119
um

868
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:50,000
exaggerates that the the list

869
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,000
size but um it's it's kind of a philos

870
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,280
philosophical discussion about segment

871
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,480
routing in general it's kind of what

872
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,160
you're saying

873
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,200
yes exactly but your points

874
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,558
taken and we'll um we'll we'll do our

875
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,640
best to include some of that information

876
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,800
in the draft

877
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,558
yeah another thing that i've been

878
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,680
wondering about is mtu

879
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,839
size and um it would be good to know

880
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,040
basically how much how much space do you

881
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,799
need to

882
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,558
store this i guess i can figure it out

883
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,839
from the draft but it'd be nice to have

884
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,839
some examples

885
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:29,760
like how much overhead do you add to the

886
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,759
packet to describe a typical tree

887
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
sure

888
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,440
any any more comments

889
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:50,880
do you feel comfortable do you feel

890
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,160
comfortable pulling the

891
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:58,240
working group yeah sure i can do

892
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:01,200
yeah i can do that so

893
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:05,118
i want to ask two questions actually one

894
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,118
is so many people i read this draft

895
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,640
let's see

896
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:25,200
so basically yeah if you have

897
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,200
read the draft please raise your hand

898
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,960
okay at least seven people that's pretty

899
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,959
good i should raise my hand as well

900
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,559
nine people

901
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,720
okay so that's a decent number that's

902
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:59,839
good

903
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:59,839
so then i want to ask one more question

904
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,920
which is do you think we should adopt

905
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,920
the current draft in pim now

906
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,720
and you can also do a negative if you

907
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,558
want

908
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,040
see the rest your hand or do not raise

909
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,040
your hand

910
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,200
yeah this is pretty nice compared to the

911
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,920
humming that we actually can see the

912
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,720
numbers

913
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,200
i think so uh yeah right now we have

914
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,799
four we have out of 20 we have four

915
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,759
people raising their hand and

916
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,440
seven people not raising their hand

917
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,240
basically

918
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,680
for again four four people think we

919
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,479
should adopt it now and

920
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:54,319
and eight people i think we should not

921
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:57,920
adopt it at this moment

922
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,920
so uh yeah i think we um

923
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,079
we should take it to the list so

924
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,000
basically it would be nice to get

925
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,160
um and a new version that addresses some

926
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,680
of the comments we got already

927
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:15,040
maybe with some examples um

928
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,160
and also get some discussion on on

929
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,680
on the list about this we should not

930
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,598
wait until the next meeting

931
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,399
we need to get some activity on the on

932
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:24,400
the mailing list

933
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:33,119
so um yeah

934
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:36,000
great great if the authors can

935
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,640
send an email to the list and start some

936
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,640
discussion

937
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,359
will do thanks that sounds good yeah all

938
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:51,839
right

939
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:51,839
okay thanks

940
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,680
okay so um let's look at the agenda

941
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,680
again

942
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:04,558
um so um

943
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,799
yeah so ramki was supposed to present

944
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,680
already start packing but he has tried

945
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,079
the

946
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,480
multiple laptops now and it basically

947
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,480
just gets the blue screen when

948
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:18,160
it echo is supposed to pop up i don't

949
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:22,480
know if that's a known problem

950
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:25,839
so i think um i'll um

951
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,839
i'll present it for him

952
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,319
does that sound good mike

953
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,480
yes thank you that sounds good yeah i

954
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:39,359
was chatting with him and he's he's okay

955
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,359
with me doing that

956
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
right

957
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,680
yeah it's a fairly short presentation

958
00:52:50,640 --> 00:53:01,839
anyway

959
00:52:51,680 --> 00:53:01,839
let's see

960
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:10,800
yeah all right yeah so um

961
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:14,319
we requested publication oh

962
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,480
this draft um a couple of months back i

963
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,759
think

964
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:22,400
and um and

965
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,200
our ad reviewed the draft and found

966
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,960
several

967
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,759
issues with it um several those we

968
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,000
should have

969
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,960
we should have found them in the working

970
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,079
group as our

971
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,280
as part of our review so

972
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,079
we need to do better at that both as a

973
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,839
working group

974
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,839
and also chairs and shepherds

975
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,598
so we should yeah we need to do better

976
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,920
in the future

977
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,920
um

978
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,879
yeah yeah by the way uh

979
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,839
yeah alvaro if you are here i have any

980
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,040
comments please

981
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:04,799
um yeah let me know but uh yeah we need

982
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,640
to do better

983
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,319
we also had the dr improvement draft

984
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,520
that

985
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:15,680
was not good enough so

986
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,920
yeah all right so for this draft um

987
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,040
it was returned to the working group and

988
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,240
since then the

989
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,040
uh the author has

990
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,319
has has worked hard and posted a new

991
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,440
version and

992
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:32,880
i also provided some review comments on

993
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,240
the previous version so hopefully it's

994
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,160
in a better shape

995
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:41,919
this time so version 6

996
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:46,319
should hopefully address the 80

997
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:50,839
comments and concerns um

998
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:53,920
so the changes were mostly editorial

999
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:57,200
um the main thing i think

1000
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:59,280
that wasn't editorial was to to um

1001
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,359
show the correct packet formats with the

1002
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,799
new um

1003
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:10,000
our new typespace where we

1004
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:10,000
basically added the the subtype concept

1005
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,760
so i think the document is in much

1006
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,279
better shape now

1007
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,599
but we yeah if you need someone

1008
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,280
some review and we need to decide do we

1009
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,760
need to do another working group last

1010
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,480
call

1011
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:33,280
or um or what do we do

1012
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,160
um any thoughts on that mic or anyone

1013
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,160
has any comments

1014
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,280
yeah i'm just trying to figure out the

1015
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,480
best way to do this because i i'm just

1016
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,079
i'm a little doubtful if we'll get

1017
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,760
many comments from the working group if

1018
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,799
any

1019
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,240
yeah that's often a problem we have

1020
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:02,480
yeah so we could but we need to

1021
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,200
i mean we've been requested to have it

1022

1040
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,319
time

1041
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,480
um and um

1042
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:09,839
you know there were a lot of issues

1043
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,440
including things as you mentioned

1044
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:12,960
that should have been caught like no

1045
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,200
security considered

1046
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,319
uh considerations section in the draft

1047
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,879
at all

1048
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,558
um and a bunch of other stuff so yes you

1049
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,160
know if we're going to

1050
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,760
um you know push things through the

1051
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,520
working group we need the working group

1052
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:31,119
to look at them right um yeah but

1053
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,680
so before just really quick so

1054
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,720
if you have noticed there are some

1055
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,799
issues with the

1056
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:42,000
chat in miraco

1057
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:46,559
so i was told that we're going to

1058
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,839
reboot the vm maybe in a minute or so

1059
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,000
so i'm not sure we're going to actually

1060
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:54,319
lose the whole thing

1061
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,319
or just the jabber chat

1062
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:02,160
so just so you know right if we go away

1063
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,400
um come back in a minute or two

1064
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,399
maybe

1065
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,359
yeah miami meat echo just restarted at

1066
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,359
least

1067
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:24,960
yeah think we are

1068
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,960

1069
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,839
yeah alvaro is coming back here too

1070
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:55,200

1073
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,200
anything else to say just to give you a

1074
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,200
heads up that

1075
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,558

1076
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,559
you're back now

1077
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:17,920
um yeah yeah so

1078
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:19,279
we really need more more review and um

1079
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,359
we can do a working room plus

1080
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:22,559
call but we need to make sure that some

1081
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:25,359
people actually

1082
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,960
respond to that and read the document so

1083
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:27,440

1085
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:36,240

uh so yeah uh

1110
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,000
so i think we'll um

1111
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:19,520
[Music]

1112
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,319
maybe wait for the two of you to

1113
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,000
review it first in case you have

1114
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:28,480
substantial comments and then

1115
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,680
we'll um do a working group last call

1116
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,359
uh once you have done that and

1117
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,440
either we have addressed the issues you

1118
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,839
find or if there's no major issues we

1119
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,640
can

1120
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:41,040
do the last call before we revise the

1121
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,040
draft

1122
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:48,078
but hopefully then in a few weeks we'll

1123
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,319
do a working group last call and

1124
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,520
we need as many of you as possible to

1125
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:54,160
[Music]

1126
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:56,880
to read the draft and comment reply on

1127
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,879
the last call

1128
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:10,160
but uh yeah i would say in general we

1129
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,879
struggle to get enough people to review

1130
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,160
documents

1131
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:17,359
and we may have to

1132
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:19,038
basically not not publish documents if

1133
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:22,319
you don't get

1134
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,319
enough reviewers and

1135
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:27,598
if if a document is useful and and and

1136
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,359
people think it's good then worth doing

1137
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:35,839
then hopefully there will be some people

1138
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:35,839
willing to review it as well

1139
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,400
um but yeah i really appreciate getting

1140
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,039
these two people to review this document

1141
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,920
this time

1142
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,920
so that's great

1143
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,480
all right um i think we can move on to

1144
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,920
the last presentation then

1145
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,720
mike right yeah

1146
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,200
sounds good so yeah you can share your

1147
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,520
own

1148
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:03,759
yeah you can share your own slides i

1149
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:17,839
guess or

1150
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:17,839
yeah i'll share my own slides okay

1151
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,799
are we good can you see these yeah

1152
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,240
okay good all right so yeah we should be

1153
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:30,960
done in the next 10 minutes or so so

1154
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,959
people can go to bed

1155
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,118
so this was presented an hour and a half

1156
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,640
ago in embondi

1157
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,960
for many of you that were there you'll

1158
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,240
this will be a bit of a repeat

1159
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,280
i'll try to quickly go through it

1160
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:48,399
but this is a draft that we have

1161
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:49,920
presented uh in both mbo and d and pim

1162
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,039
in the past about a year or so ago i

1163
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,720
think

1164
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,400
it's a draft that we've been pursuing in

1165
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,640
ippm working group

1166
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,520
ip performance measurement working group

1167
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:01,680
and

1168
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:04,799
it being that it's multicast specific

1169
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,558
um and oem

1170
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:10,319
specific it's had a hard time getting

1171
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,400
any traction in ippm

1172
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,400
ippm working group and uh

1173
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,038
we as i mentioned previously it's

1174
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,880
something that we discussed with

1175
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:25,440
warren and we tried to get some

1176
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,280
advice from him and and this these kind

1177
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,880
of drafts do have a hard time

1178
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:33,520
so we we could um

1179
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,319
either have it addressed in the ops area

1180
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,440
working group

1181
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:39,520
um mbondi uh or pym what we presented in

1182
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:41,839
mbondi is that maybe what we could do

1183
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:43,440
is i'll get into the details in just a

1184
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:44,558
little second but maybe develop a

1185
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,599
problem statement

1186
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:51,200
in mbondi and

1187
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,160
discuss the protocol modifications in

1188
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,680
pim

1189
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,680
this would have to be something that we

1190
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:59,200
would have to

1191
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,520
run by the ippm working group chairs

1192
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,038
if we're to do this but i would suspect

1193
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,839
that they would be

1194
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:10,559
happy to have it done somewhere else um

1195
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:12,078
so the background is that

1196
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,400
multicast traffic monitoring is

1197
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:15,359
important we need to build to

1198
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,119
reconstruct

1199
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:19,279
point to multi-point trees and and

1200
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,760
visualize them

1201
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,880
and we need to build to monitor the

1202
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:27,359
performance

1203
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:30,400
the jitter the packet drops

1204
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:32,078
and do so beyond what conventional oem

1205
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,000
techniques are able to give us and so

1206
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:36,319
there are some on path telemetry

1207
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,599
techniques that are available that are

1208
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:40,960
being worked on

1209
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:44,319
in ippm uh

1210
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:47,520
the i om draft is something that has

1211
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:51,680
been it's nearing the end of

1212
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,079
its getting through the standards

1213
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,200
process in that working group uh there's

1214
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,559
some other ones that have not been

1215
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,839
adopted in the working group yet that

1216
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:59,280
are being worked on

1217
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:02,400
but they all have to do with adding

1218
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:06,400
telemetry data in the packet itself

1219
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:09,760
in band so in suto oem

1220
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,599
in ban iom in band oam is being

1221
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,280
is worked on and so there's some

1222
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:15,440
problems with those techniques however

1223
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,559
um they do have some flaws for multicast

1224
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,680
with

1225
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,839
inbound oem um every packet can tears

1226
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:22,879
it contains uh carries the entire trace

1227
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,680
data

1228
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,960
the entire point of multi-point data

1229
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,558
trace and so there's a lot of

1230
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,000
data redundancy because when you're

1231
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,520
collecting that data capturing and

1232
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,559
collecting it sending it to where you

1233
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,720
want to

1234
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:36,480
analyze that data it's just a lot of

1235
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,078
redundant data and so i think we can do

1236
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,520
better

1237
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,160
and then there's some other solutions

1238
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,400
like postcard based trees

1239
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,759
that make it so that there's not as much

1240
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:49,440
redundant data

1241
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,720
but there's no branch identifier and so

1242
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:57,119
we propose a way that you can

1243
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:59,118
add a branch identifier to build to

1244
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,680
properly recreate the trees and

1245
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,599
correlate those postcards

1246
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:06,240
and so we want to build to our the

1247
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:08,240
objective of the of this draft is to

1248
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,439
be able to allow the original multicast

1249
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,720
tree to be correctly

1250
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:17,440
reconstructed without unnecessarily

1251
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,439
uh replicating the telemetry information

1252
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:25,038
so there's a variety of ways that we can

1253
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:27,039
do this the draft mentions a few

1254
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,720
highlighting the this one and then on

1255
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:31,920
the following slide and there's

1256
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:34,000
there's per hop postcard and there's per

1257
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,039
section postcard a postcard

1258
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
is um add a branch

1259
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:43,119
node that sends a postcard to the the

1260
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,280
collector of the telemetry data of

1261
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,599
the status of the the packet at that

1262
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:50,880
point

1263
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:53,680
and so we add a branch identifier

1264
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,319
in this draft to the instruction header

1265
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:57,598
to be able

1266
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,960
to help reconstruct a tree because

1267
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,200
that's something that

1268
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,559
is not able to be done right now with

1269
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:06,799
existing solutions you can have these

1270
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,559
postcard based solutions but there's not

1271
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,480
a way to

1272
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,799
properly reconstruct a tree when you're

1273
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,240
looking at this telemetry data and so

1274
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:17,759
this is something that we're

1275
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,920
proposing to be added to it um

1276
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,960
and then there's another way that using

1277
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,279
per section

1278
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:28,000
postcard where you've got um

1279
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:29,040
the data for a particular section that

1280
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,479
is

1281
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:35,439
collected and then correlated and

1282
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,439
we're able to

1283
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:42,639
make a similar adjustment to uh

1284
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,960
the packet to build to provide that at

1285
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:48,000
the branch node as well

1286
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,000
and so um

1287
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:53,920
again what we're trying to accomplish is

1288
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,759
being able to make

1289
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:01,759
telemetry data efficient for multicast

1290
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:04,560
and um we

1291
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:05,920
naturally just repeat myself naturally

1292
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,920
something that we would want to be doing

1293
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,960
in ippbm because that's where this

1294
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,920
telemetry data is being worked on but

1295
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,600
being that um it's not exciting there's

1296
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,000
not the expertise with multicast

1297
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,679
as i explained before it's similar to

1298
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
what we've done in the spring working

1299
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,520
group

1300
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,920
where we've taken the point to

1301
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,799
multi-point uh

1302
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,319
drafts and we are working on them in pim

1303
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:30,319
at least one of them right now

1304
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,080
and the spring chairs were happy to have

1305
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:35,440
us do so

1306
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:39,120
and it's a similar situation we think

1307
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:42,879
with uh multicast telemetry data

1308
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:45,839
and so we're proposing

1309
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,640
to either have a problem statement draft

1310
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,479
in mbd

1311
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,480
and then have protocol modifications

1312
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:53,519
done in pim or just have it all be done

1313
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:56,879
in pim and just keep it as one draft

1314
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,880
as we have right now so um

1315
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,199
first are there any questions and then

1316
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,600
second we

1317
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:06,400
uh my final request would be to you just

1318
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,760
to pull the working group to see if uh

1319
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,320
this is something that we think that

1320
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:13,600
needs to that should be done here

1321
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,880
and if it is then we will i'll need to

1322
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,080
have you stig

1323
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,600
king the uh ippm chairs kind of like we

1324
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,199
did with spring and then ask them if

1325
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,239
they're okay

1326
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:26,000
so when you say do the work here you're

1327
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:27,678
not talking about the current draft

1328
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,840
right but basically

1329
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:31,840
any future work in this area

1330
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,480
yeah yeah uh let's see lenny has some

1331
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,480
comments

1332
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:44,719
yeah mike so um it went by quickly

1333
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,440
in mbondi um so i didn't get a chance to

1334
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:47,760
ask but

1335
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,199
so what what exactly was the experience

1336
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,239
so you've taken this

1337
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:55,919
first to ippm and they

1338
01:10:52,239 --> 01:11:00,400
were not interested or um zero

1339
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:03,280
yeah yeah great question so we've had

1340
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:03,599
we've sent a couple emails um and we've

1341
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,800
had

1342
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,920
zero response and so just nothing it's a

1343
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,480
very busy

1344
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,440
working group and so they they're busy

1345
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,879
working on

1346
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,919
things that they're interested in and

1347
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:19,280
they just don't have interest in

1348
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:21,280
in this type of multicast oem um

1349
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:22,480
and we but we didn't we received zero

1350
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,679
response we did

1351
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:26,000
privately um email frank brockner's

1352
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,040
who's

1353
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
leading the iom data

1354
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:33,440
draft and uh he gave us some advice and

1355
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,800
so we kind of modified it

1356
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:41,519
further uh we paint the chairs

1357
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,840
of ippm and they said yeah um

1358
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,360
you know keep you know you feel free to

1359
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,560
keep trying

1360
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:50,080
basically and so it's a it it's you know

1361
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,400
this isn't the only draft that i've had

1362
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,080
that

1363
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,559
over the years of working the itf you

1364
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,159
have to rally interest at times

1365
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,679
but particularly for multicast as you

1366
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,159
know it's just some people just don't

1367
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:59,920
care

1368
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:01,679
or don't know about multicast enough to

1369
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:03,199
want to do anything about it so we're

1370
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,400
kind of saying you know what there may

1371
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,519
be a better way to do this

1372
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:09,360
and so that's why we're here

1373
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,960
so so you wouldn't anticipate them

1374
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,719
taking umbrage with uh

1375
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,719
uh it being the work being done

1376
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,480
elsewhere no i don't

1377
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,920
anticipate that their toes are being

1378
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,199
stepped upon no

1379
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,880
but we would make sure if this

1380
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:24,400
if our working groups were to decide to

1381
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,080
take this on we would definitely

1382
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,559
have to ask them first just to kind of

1383
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:30,559
make sure they're cool with it

1384
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,840
so the the protocol work here is

1385
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,600
basically

1386
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:38,480
extending ippm protocols right

1387
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,679
yeah and there's only one of those

1388
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:42,959
that's currently adopted

1389
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:46,480
the iom data

1390
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:49,520
draft the other ones are being

1391
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:52,799
proposed right

1392
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,520
yeah so um one i guess one question is

1393
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,040
whether it's

1394
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,280
in a charger or not but um

1395
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:01,760
i think i would have to double check but

1396
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:04,320
i think it should be in the charger

1397
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,199
because it is multicast protocols at

1398
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:08,000
least i would think

1399
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:09,678
away that way but you would definitely

1400
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,719
have to check with the chairs

1401
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,960
and ads

1402
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,920
i guess about where this work should be

1403
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,239
done

1404
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,920
but but yeah we should find out first if

1405
01:13:18,239 --> 01:13:22,000
there's interest in doing this

1406
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,000
and

1407
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,360
so uh should i just ask the question or

1408
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:32,480
yeah please

1409
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:34,960
it's a fun tool go ahead thanks yeah

1410
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,959
let's see

1411
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,400
so we're not talking about the specific

1412
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:45,520
draft now but basically

1413
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:47,599
um huge future drafts right

1414
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,520
yeah i don't that's a good point i i

1415
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,880
mean i'm only worried about this draft

1416
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,320
that i've just presented but

1417
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:56,880
um yeah but i mean

1418
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,440
maybe it doesn't work in general sure

1419
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,440
yeah

1420
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,639
because i mean the current draft

1421
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,639
probably would

1422
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,239
i know it would go to mbo and d right

1423
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,840
possibly or it would be split

1424
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:10,879
in two yeah probably split in two yeah

1425
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,280
so i think i wanna ask you know do you

1426
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,360
think

1427
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:18,639
we should do this

1428
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,639
do work in this area

1429
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:29,840
well maybe i should be more specific

1430
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,719
uh let me try this i think

1431
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:42,080
so when i say this area basically along

1432
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,320
the lines of what is described in this

1433
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:48,960
draft but it doesn't have to be

1434
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,960
exactly as it is specified right

1435
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,280
so we're not saying that we will adopt

1436
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:57,199
this the current document but

1437
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:58,400
just want to see if there's interest in

1438
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:11,839
working on this

1439
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:11,839
kind of stuff

1440
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:23,120
yeah so far there's four people i guess

1441
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,719
you all can see it

1442
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:28,320
and flow people in favor or slowly

1443
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,480
increasing

1444
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,719
and one person that thinks we should not

1445
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,718
do it or two people thinks we should not

1446
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:39,120
do it now

1447
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:43,520
um it's a little schizophrenic

1448
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:44,000
um yeah well i mean we can say already

1449
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,080
that

1450
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,440
at least there are several people that

1451
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:52,480
think they should do this

1452
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:55,360
kind of work so that's that's good um

1453
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,400
that's like a quarter of the people on

1454
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,519
on the

1455
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:03,199
yeah that are on here

1456
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:06,000
so there's a couple people on the queue

1457
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,639
okay let's uh let's uh go back to the

1458
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,040
queue

1459
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,679
yeah let's see i can leave this running

1460
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:15,840
i guess while we do that

1461
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:20,080
all right um i'm not sure who was first

1462
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:23,360
um i guess lenny is first looks like

1463
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,320
yeah so without having uh i i didn't do

1464
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:28,480
the homework and haven't read this uh

1465
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,159
it is is it making changes to the

1466
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:33,519
protocol of pim it's adding

1467
01:16:30,159 --> 01:16:35,040
branch ids what what what is the um

1468
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,679
what's it actually doing to the protocol

1469
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:42,560
then so it's not changing

1470
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:44,000
any multicast protocol at all

1471
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,760
it's only

1472
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,800
[Music]

1473
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:54,159
adding a branch identifier

1474
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,159
to existing telemetry protocols

1475
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:57,600
to allow for

1476
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,360
efficient multicast tree reconstruction

1477
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:08,640
so um

1478
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,759
so it's uh the the changes would be for

1479
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,640
instance to

1480
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,040
um there's a couple protocols that are

1481
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,800
uh

1482
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,120
telemetry specific protocols like

1483
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,040
there's postcard based trees this hybrid

1484
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,040
two-step

1485
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,679
greg mursky wrote that draft he's

1486
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,880
involved with multicast as well as ippm

1487
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,719
related stuff

1488
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:32,000
there's an iom draft that i mentioned

1489
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:32,480
there'd be a modification to that draft

1490
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,600
as well

1491
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:37,839
so we're only talking about telemetry

1492
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,860
data here

1493
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,960
and modifying those

1494
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:44,480
[Music]

1495
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:45,760
protocols unrelated to multicast writing

1496
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,759
protocols

1497
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,640
to allow for efficient collection of

1498
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,800
multicast data

1499
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,239
so so it sounds like it's more of an oam

1500
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,880
type uh

1501
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,599
shooting tool or absolutely i would

1502
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,600
almost

1503
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,040
yeah i would almost think that that you

1504
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,239
know without

1505
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,360
it's in the middle of the night and i

1506
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,718
haven't really thought through it that

1507
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,280
much but uh

1508
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,560
um i'm thinking you know this this would

1509
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,759
seem more embownish

1510
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,520
uh embondish than um than pim

1511
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,159
because pim is usually just you know

1512
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:18,159
changes to the actual multicast routing

1513
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:19,360
and group membership protocols uh

1514
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:23,599
whereas

1515
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,599
him whereas mbondi is more

1516
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,800
focused on troubleshooting and

1517
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:30,159
operational and

1518
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:33,040
you know maintenance um so

1519
01:18:30,159 --> 01:18:33,599
i think it might be a better fit there

1520
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,120
but

1521
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,600
yeah i think yeah yeah i think you might

1522
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,480
be

1523
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,920
right we certainly should think about

1524
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,718
that and i know

1525
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,840
stuff like m trace for instance has been

1526
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,400
done in mlmd

1527
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:48,400
and yeah

1528
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:58,480
alvaro

1529
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,280
um yeah i sort of agree with lenny there

1530
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,718
on

1531
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,719
uh you know sort of the division there

1532
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:05,120
of labor and uh

1533
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,960
you're looking at the charters yeah

1534
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,320
mbondi specifically talks about

1535
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,120
extending protocols

1536
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:12,320
to provide tools and stuff like that um

1537
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:15,360
so that may work there

1538
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:18,719
i i think that you're still

1539
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:21,280
very premature to talk about adoption or

1540
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,840
actually doing the work anywhere

1541
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:24,320
without knowing exactly what the work is

1542
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,040
um

1543
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,000
and maybe others actually wrote the

1544
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:30,000
draft i

1545
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,679
haven't but i think you know that's

1546
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,800
that's an important step

1547
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,719
and as you said already before um

1548
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,239
you know talk to the ippm guys to make

1549
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,560
sure they're okay

1550
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,559
um lack of interest

1551
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,520
is not the same for a working group

1552
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,280
i mean we're used to unfortunately in

1553
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,400
pim i mean we have people are interested

1554
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,320
in multicast but

1555
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,400
there's not a lot of excitement a lot of

1556
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,719
the time we get two and three people and

1557
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:58,080
we're

1558
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,520
really happy about something um so that

1559
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,360
doesn't always translate to the same

1560
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:04,719
thing in other working groups

1561
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,400
so i would really uh i guess uh steg or

1562
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,080
lenny whoever is going to go talk to the

1563
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,440
app guys

1564
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,360
if it was me i would really be

1565
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,599
interested in understanding

1566
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,839
their point of view on you know what

1567
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,440
that means from their working group

1568
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,880
if it is just that you know they don't

1569
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:20,000
understand multicast you know whatever

1570
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,760
or if

1571
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,280
they think it means something else it

1572
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,639
probably just means that they don't

1573
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,559
you know they were just too excited and

1574
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:29,120
that's it nothing necessarily bad but

1575
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,880
it'll be a good question to ask them um

1576
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:32,320
and just one more announcement i

1577
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,639
said before that we were going to reboot

1578
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,799
the whole mid-echo thing

1579
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:41,679
for some miracle our session didn't stop

1580
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,600
but the chat is back if you want to go

1581
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,320
back to the chat you can but you need to

1582
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,040
reload the page

1583
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,400
um so that's it we're probably almost

1584
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,040
done anyways but

1585
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,040
um if you want to go chat with someone

1586
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,880
thanks

1587
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,960
yeah thank you very much just to

1588
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,159
conclude that comment then is i think

1589
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:02,960
what i'll do stig

1590
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:04,719
and lenny is as an individual

1591
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,320
contributor since i'm

1592
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,400
aware of what's going on here is i think

1593
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,599
i will email the ippm chairs

1594
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:14,400
copy you and then just tell them what

1595
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,000
we're considering that we're evaluating

1596
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,839
this potentially being work done in

1597
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,440
these working groups and wanted to get

1598
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,120
their feedback

1599
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,360
that's unreasonable yeah that sounds

1600
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,360
good

1601
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,679
okay

1602
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:34,800
i guess either way though even if they

1603
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:37,600
are interested it's probably good to

1604
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,320
have um some draft maybe an mbondy

1605
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,239
talking about

1606
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:43,920
the the need for this right and how it

1607
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:47,199
could be used

1608
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:49,840
i think so i think a general um

1609
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,199
telemetry draft and either way i i think

1610
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,320
you're absolutely right either way i

1611
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,159
think a telemetry

1612
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,840
multicast telemetry draft needs to be

1613
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,839
done in mbod i think you're right

1614
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,920
so if anybody's interested please come

1615
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,560
contact me we'll

1616
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,560
make that happen

1617
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:11,840
and are we done

1618
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,120
yeah i think we're done then unless

1619
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,719
there's any more comments

1620
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,719
on this or anything else

1621
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:26,480
