1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,120
not get enough sleep as it is

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,440
but we're about to start it's nine yeah

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,799
i think the uk has the uk has it worst

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,880
this time

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,480
because i'm i'm one hour behind europe

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,840
so it's

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,720
5 a.m for me but uh you're right

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,480
europe can't complain we i think

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,359
somebody i think was lou berger did some

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
analysis on

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,000
uh relative time difference to

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,200
ietf conference times and it's easiest

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,360
for europe

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
i think it's it's hardest for west coast

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,320
us and uh

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,960
places like japan where for one of the

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,200
meetings

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,280
it's a 16-hour time difference or

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,280
something crazy

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,559

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,239

couldn't make it they get a chance to

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,959
listen to this again

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,520
during their normal working hours so

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
straight on to the administrivia we are

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,280
using meat echo uh

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
hopefully you are all using meat echo

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
too but i know some people

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
are only listening to the audio stream

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
and um

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,720
jabber as well so as we said before we

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,599
started the session

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,599
we will be taking notes using kodi md

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,440
which is the integrated markdown

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,440
based collaborative editor

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
so ethan has kindly said that he will

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,760
happily type away but

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,519
it's a collaborative environment so

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,480
please everyone

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,160
if you uh want to make sure your

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,160
comments have been recorded correctly

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,239
please jump into cody md

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
uh the link is on the screen it's also

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,840
accessible through some useful

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,680
um shortcut in the muteco

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,080
ui itself and uh please add

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,920
extra comments uh correct your name is a

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
common thing to do

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
because we all get over excited and talk

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,840
very fast

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,958
also there is jabber which is

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,560
also matched into the meat echo ui but

83
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
some people are using

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
other tools so we will be monitoring the

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
uh

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,760
the jabber chat as well i can see

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,480
alexandre procresco already has problems

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,879
with urls on the screen

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,640
that's because it's a pdf i'm afraid but

90
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
the pdf materials

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
are available as part of all the meeting

92
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,760
tools

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,920
so you can find the links there

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,239
afterwards as usual we have a mailing

95
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
list because we are a working group so

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
hopefully you're subscribed to that if

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,359
not please do for uh

98
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,640
it's the correct place for

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,720
itf discussion as as ever

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
and as i mentioned the meeting materials

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,000
are all available on the

102
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,518
raw data tracker page um

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,920
so you can find them there so straight

104
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
on

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,399
to the agenda eve do you want to take

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,519
over at this point

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,159
yeah sure um we're in the middle of our

108
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,480
intro

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
hopefully it won't take too long but to

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,959
give you a sense of what's coming

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,320
uh we've got pascal up first to talk

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
first about

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,440
the technologies draft which was

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
formally

115
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,400
adopted between the last itf and this

116
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,919
one

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,599
and that will be followed by the

118
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,359
architecture draft

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,840
which is getting fairly mature so

120
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,800
there'll be

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,960
some discussion about how mature it is

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
we also adopted the use cases draft

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,840
which carlos will

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,360
give us a brief update on its status

125
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,039
not a lot of changes there since the

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,759
last time but

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
some of what's coming ahead or some of

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
the issues that

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,720
are open niels will report out um

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
the third of the drafts that was

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,360
formally adopted at the last ietf which

132
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,639
is on

133
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,759
the ldax technology and finally

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,800
fabrice will report to us

135
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,759
about the oam draft which

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,440
between the last ietf and this one was

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,199
as recommended

138
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
and agreed to by both the debt

139
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
networking group and the raw working

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,840
group it was split

141
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
into its respective parts but of course

142
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,679
uh

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,759
given that the authors uh straddle both

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,560
groups uh there's harmonization between

145
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
them

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
and uh we do have a little bit of extra

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,080
padding which of course we always need

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
so um in fact we have i think in it

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,400
it says 10 minutes here but we've got uh

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,840
about 25 minutes to spare

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,919
uh beyond um what's listed here

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,840
so really kind of 35 minutes for

153
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,198
discussion

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,280
next slide please there we go

155
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
and um if you were to look back at the

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,080
milestones that were

157
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,039
enumerated in the charter the first of

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
the milestones

159
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,680
was to produce and adopt a use cases

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
document i think we're right on

161
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,199
on task for that there was

162
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,360
also a requirements draft that was

163
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,319
mentioned in the charter which has

164
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,720
really been replaced by the technologies

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,360
draft and in fact the requirements have

166
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
become

167
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,400
part of the use cases uh internet draft

168
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,039
and the technologies is kind of an

169
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,840
overarching

170
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,120
document which we'll hear more about in

171
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,560
the session

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,199
um our other milestones um

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,639
you know if you look at what's coming up

174
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
for you know this month

175
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,600
um we have stated that we

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,600
you know perhaps the use cases

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
documentary would be ready to submit to

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,479
iesg we'll have some discussion about

179
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
whether we think that is really the case

180
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,560
or not

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,680
um but additionally

182
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,840
um we'll we should really should be

183
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,319
discussing at this ietf whether the

184
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,679
architecture framework document

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:12,000
is almost there i think we're close

186
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:14,960
december we wanted to submit that

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,440
technologies draft to the iesgen again i

188
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
think

189
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,199
after we hear from pascal we'll have a

190
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
better sense of um

191
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
how some of the authors and and us

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,440
audience members

193
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,880
feel about its maturity uh to meet that

194
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,599
goal to submit it uh

195
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,800
in december and you know the thing that

196
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,000
we're really

197
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,039
headed towards as a working group is

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,080
this uh draft which would be the

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
evaluation

200
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,240
of all of the existing ietf technologies

201
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,960
in a gap analysis

202
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,599
and um you know we really can't get to

203
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,758
that

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,280
until we have these three other

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,639
documents completed

206
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,599
and so it it appears at the moment that

207
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
december was a little bit over ambitious

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,520
um

209
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,879
but uh we're not far off we're maybe you

210
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
know

211
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
you know again it depends on these three

212
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
other documents that are

213
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,520
uh kind of foundational documents around

214
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,919
use cases technologies and architecture

215
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
as well as some of the other ones that

216
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,878
actually aren't in these milestones that

217
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
uh hopefully we will add to the

218
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,080
milestones

219
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,878
um and we can have some discussions

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,599
about

221
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,759
when would be appropriate time frames uh

222
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
to tie ourselves or at least uh

223
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
project that that they should appear on

224
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,880
this list

225
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
so um uh you know and then obviously

226
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,719
these

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
these last couple of milestones were

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
about the submission of these things to

229
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
the iesg

230
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
and uh all of that is contingent on

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
things

232
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,279
um getting mature enough so

233
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800
well we will have some discussion about

234
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,680
all of these you know where we are i

235
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
would say that

236
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,519
you know just at 10 000 foot view

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
we're probably about six months away

238
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,920
from four to six months away from maybe

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
these

240
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,439
the last document um

241
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,519
and uh we'll just have to see how that

242
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,519
plays out

243
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,160
so can i just quickly jump in here as

244
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,640
rick again um

245
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,079
one of the key steers we've been getting

246
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
from the ads

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,120
is this is not a document writing

248
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,160
working group

249
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,160
so uh the steer we're getting is please

250
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,839
don't spend two and a half years

251
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,880
writing lovely rich documents about the

252
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,440
problem

253
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
before we get trying to solve some of

254
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
the problems

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,199
so although we understand that it's

256
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,040
uh important to define our use cases and

257
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,160
really understand the gaps that are

258
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,319
existing

259
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,160
and it would and it is great to have

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,760
these things documented we

261
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,880
don't want to spend many years producing

262
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,600
lovely documents and

263
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,399
nothing else so we want to move on to

264
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,160
proposing protocols to solve some of the

265
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
problems but of course we do understand

266
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,839
that we have to define the problems

267
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,440
hence these milestones are pretty um

268
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,040
you know these dates are pretty tight

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
we're talking about september november

270
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
december this year

271
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,680
and understand obviously um covet has

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
made everything a bit more difficult and

273
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,319
of course until you actually start

274
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
breaking down these documents and

275
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,360
understanding the problem space

276
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,880
you don't really have a good estimate of

277
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
how long it's going to take

278
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,000
but we don't want to see these data we

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,959
don't want to be having this discussion

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,959
this time next year with 2021 written

281
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,800
where 2020 is written now

282
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,399
and still not actually have any of these

283
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,160
documents finished so

284
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,160
that's that's my little two cents

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,959
next slide next slide

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,480
carry on even

287
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
unless you want me to cover this up yeah

288
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,640
what are you carry on

289
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,120
okay so um as you i'll just jump back

290
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,760
one slide as you can see that there is a

291
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
um a charter item to say that there

292
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
should be

293
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,720
it's the fourth one down that there's a

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,240
in november we should the working group

295
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
adoption of architecture framework

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
aspects for a wireless network document

297
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,239
so

298
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
of course the charter is written as the

299
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,880
working group forms

300
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,360
so it's the view from march

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,320
april whenever it was this year rather

302
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
than current understanding so

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
uh pascal has got an individual draft

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,360
talking about architecture and framework

305
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
aspects

306
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
um so my question really to him and i'll

307
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
let that these are questions really to

308
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
have

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,079
after various presentations particularly

310
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,760
on on this draft is

311
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
is this document proposed for working

312
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,079
group adoption and

313
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
uh equally if so does the working group

314
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
consider it ready

315
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,240
so this is something i'd like people to

316
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
consider while they

317
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,079
listen to pascal talk about his work

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,360
because of course it's

319
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,120
currently an individual draft

320
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
and my other second point is while i was

321
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
putting these slides together we've got

322
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,240
a couple of other individual drafts

323
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,240
which is great

324
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,279
question to the individual draft authors

325
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
are

326
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,920
are they still active um are they

327
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,920
looking to get these things adopted

328
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,599
or were these proof of concepts and and

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,040
the the working group was quite a good

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,680
place just to get some review and

331
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,719
feedback

332
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,880
um so some open questions with my chair

333
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
hat on personally speaking

334
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,160
i think it's great that people put

335
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
forwards individual drafts here are some

336
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,959
concepts it's a great forum to get some

337
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,120
feedback

338
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,518
and i'd really like it to continue to be

339
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
um and i quite understand sometimes

340
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
having put a bit of work in you realize

341
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,959
yeah this is a dead end don't worry

342
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
about it and that's that's fine we can

343
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,518
let these documents drop off

344
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,680
but equally as as chairs if these

345
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,959
if these individual drafts are going in

346
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,560
are people interested in getting them

347
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,839
adopted is it valid for the working

348
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
group so that's a that's another

349
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,399
consideration there about

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
draft adoption and the other slide i've

351
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,279
got is about draft

352
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,839
submission so as eve covered in the

353
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,399
uh charter milestones we've got some

354
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,680
fairly

355
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,760
aspirational dates for getting the use

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,638
cases and the technologies documents

357
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,800
off to the iesg for review and formal

358
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,440
sign off

359
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,240
pretty quickly so this is a question

360
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,320
really to the

361
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,040
authors and of course to the working

362
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,200
group um

363
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,240
let's not go to the isg until we think

364
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,839
it's ready

365
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
so the question is do we think it's

366
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,360
ready um and that's

367
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,959
that's an open question and something to

368
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,279
think about during

369
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,719
uh the presentations coming up and

370
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,839
perhaps something we can

371
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,519
discuss at the mic and on the mailing

372
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,880
list after this session

373
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,880
okay so

374
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,719
that's it from me eve do you have

375
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,399
anything else you want to add

376
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,920
no i think that's fine carlos it looks

377
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,600
like you're in the queue

378
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,639
did you want to say something

379
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,720
yes can you hear me yes

380
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,079
hi hi everybody i just wanted to comment

381
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,399
on or to

382
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
respond to great questions on two slides

383
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
before

384
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
on one of the individual drafts the raw

385
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,680
make

386
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,439
one uh so this is active i didn't ask

387
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
for presentation this time because i i

388
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,120
want to do another iteration before

389
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,680
but sure the next idea i will be asking

390
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,440
agenda time and if if possible i will

391
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,120
prepare i will be presenting this so

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,320
just to communicate that that is

393
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,079
active okay that's that's great i

394
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
i just wanted to make sure equally that

395
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,199
as chairs we weren't just

396
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,800
ignoring these individual drafts and we

397
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,199
were making sure that that you had the

398
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
time

399
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,479
that you needed to do it okay so that's

400
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,480
good that's brilliant thank you

401
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,639
um right so uh i can only show slides

402
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
and not see meat echo at the same time

403
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,040
which is a bit annoying

404
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,880
so it's pascal first i believe

405
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
pascal's first and i think you have to

406
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,760
stop sharing so that he can share

407
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,920
okay if i have his slides back up if

408
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:07,439
they don't work pascal

409
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,439
i will stop screen how's that

410
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,880
pascal do you have to uh

411
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,760
are you there pascal you may have to

412
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,760
unmute your mic

413
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,480
we've lost pascal temporarily

414
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,399
i know he's just gone to the back of the

415
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,399
queue

416
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,680
now let's see if he can get back on and

417
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
then

418
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
it was there i was hearing you but when

419
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,440
i wanted to speak

420
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,519
um and then i lost the button which

421
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,920
allows me to share so which one is

422
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,399
okay i think you have to join the queue

423
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
first

424
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,719
oh no i've joined the queue myself

425
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,719
that's not good

426
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,920
um so you know what can you present my

427
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,399
it's gonna be okay sure

428
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:15,680
many of them sure much like sometimes

429
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,880
here i if for reference i think

430
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,120
you have to put your hand up symbol

431
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,000
which means joining the queue i will

432
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
operate my screen

433
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,800
then i think you can request to share

434
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
your screen

435
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,719
next to the hand button there is a

436
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,399
publish screen button

437
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,920
i'm still in queue for i can see uh

438
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,000
okay i can see you in the queue

439
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,160
maybe you have to admit to me i'm in

440
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,279
this tool it's interesting

441
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,519
i forgot we used oh there is a screen

442
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,560
cue so now i know there we go

443
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,199
grant screen i can now say

444
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,199
yes voila you now have you should be

445
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,399
sharing your screen now

446
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,000
so yeah let's meet if not i can i can do

447
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,119
it but it i think it's worth

448
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,559
trying to make this work once terrific

449
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,399
are you on it yes we see it

450
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,799
i i don't yeah so it's a little bit

451
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,799
slice

452
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,120
you can put it in full screen if you can

453
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,799
i'm in full screen now

454
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,958
but i have a single screen i put

455
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,000
one second i can't see the screen can

456
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,840
anyone else

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,840
see pascal's screen just uh

458
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
i tell you what shall i share if it

459
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,439
seemed seemed to work for me

460
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
then i'll i'll i'll share pascal slides

461
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,320
and pascal

462
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,679
i can make it almost full screen by you

463
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,720
know reducing the

464
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,720
wasted piece now we are there but yes i

465
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,280
mean i projected it and it wouldn't

466
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,400
show the projected thing but yeah here

467
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,399
we go it's almost there right

468
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
okay

469
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,480
so yes thank you if we we you introduced

470
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,320
it and and yes we

471
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,520
uh we published as a zero zero

472
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,960
so there are not big news

473
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,600
for this draft since we uh introduced

474
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,160
the

475
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:32,000
the 5g code the text last time

476
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,600
so for newcomers i'm just

477
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
just a quick reminder of what this

478
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,480
document is so

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,600
basically this document illustrates the

480
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
progress

481
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,240
that has been done on a collection of

482
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
radio technologies and that includes

483
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
wi-fi

484
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:53,200
six and and seven which is upcoming

485
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,400
um 15 for tsch that's where six displays

486
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,200
uh 5g now that we have the the new

487
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,720
section by

488
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,799
uh yanash and ldax

489
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
uh which will be uh also discussed

490
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,280
separately during this meeting

491
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,880
which is uh air-to-ground and air-to-air

492
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,678
communication for planes

493
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,799
so all those technologies have a very

494
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,440
interesting feature

495
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,400
that they can be scheduled meaning that

496
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
you can

497
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,080
reserve bandwidth for critical flows

498
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:28,160
and ensure a degree of reliability

499
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
and possibly um warranty latency it's

500
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,600
not always the case but you can

501
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
provide some some latency guarantees

502
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,199
based on scheduling

503
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,399
so with this we feel that we can

504
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,640
actually build that layer 3

505
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
the the reliable and variable services

506
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,360
that row is promising

507
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
so that's why we present those

508
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,080
technologies and in particular we focus

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,039
on the special qualities that those new

510
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,559
radios have

511
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,160
that will enable raw over them

512
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,559
so the document was adapted it's

513
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,160
published as a draft etf

514
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,760
and well we did work quite a bit as a

515
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,960
personal submission and you find there

516
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,840
are many authors

517
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,360
so it was a mini workgroup document

518
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,000
before it was officially won i mean

519
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,559
there was

520
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
enough people like a group of people uh

521
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,200
working on this document so yes

522
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,000
um as if said it's already pretty

523
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
already the

524
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
the big question to the group and it's

525
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,840
gonna be on the next slide

526
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,600
is do we have the exact structure that

527
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,918
the group wants

528
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
because what it's all about is providing

529
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,720
a structure which

530
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,639
illustrates uh what the technology is

531
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
what the documents come from you know we

532
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,039
want to make sure that

533
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,559
uh the open standards blog because the

534
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,240
atf doesn't want to work on

535
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:46,240
uh proprietary stuff um then

536
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,919
we we want to make sure that people

537
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,080
realize

538
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,360
the uh the general possibilities of

539
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,559
those radios like

540
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,639
things like ranch robot blood

541
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,240
and then we have this very important

542
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,679
section for us which is

543
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
uh how well suited this technology is

544
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,520
for

545
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,120
for role so we have those three main

546
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,360
sections and they have been there since

547
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,199
the inception of this document

548
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,678
now 5g came uh last

549
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,559
and as as you can see on the right i

550
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,559
have put the

551
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,720
the structure of the 5g section and

552
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:24,399
you'll find that

553
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,080
5gb has introduced this section 6.3

554
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,480
which is not in the general framework

555
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,918
that the other section has followed

556
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,760
about deployment and spectrum

557
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,320
personally yes editor i really love that

558
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,600
section and i find it useful

559
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,960
uh i was wondering if we want uh

560
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,439
street equality uh on all sections

561
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,520
in which case we would ask the the

562
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,559
authors of the individual section

563
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,200
of technologies to provide a similar

564
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,240
section

565
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
uh something like 6.3 so so that's

566
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,559
basically the

567
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,720
the big question there for the group

568
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,520
today and over the mailing list

569
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,640
now if somebody sees that there is uh

570
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,918
yet another section that's missing

571
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,919
uh then it's it's time to speak um

572
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,000
and then we again will go through the

573
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,880
editors of uh

574
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,799
every section and ask them to to produce

575
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,159
this particular section

576
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,720
so question one is yes this section

577
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:27,200
6.3 deployment spectrum is that a a good

578
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,799
subsection to add to every technology

579
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,799
and i would like people to speak up

580
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,919
i don't see the queue i hope you can

581
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,799
still hear me i'm still live

582
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,600
yes we can we can hear you and i can see

583
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,600
the cue and how am i supposed to

584
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,039
i can see that you're at the helm of the

585
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,678
cube pascal but so was lou

586
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,039
lou why don't you go ahead let me remove

587
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,000
myself from the queue because i was

588
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,158
there just to get them

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
yeah we can hear you luke go ahead okay

590
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,880
i wanted to respond to the question

591
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,720
about missing sections and it's really a

592
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,400
question of where this shows up

593
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
are is there a place where relevant ietf

594
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
technologies

595
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
show up

596
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
oh um here we are not talking about ietf

597
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,240
technologies where it's really

598
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,880
on the radios themselves it's it's it

599
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,640
would be another document though

600
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,960
right and in fact if i'm not mistaken

601
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,880
pascal that gets discussed in the

602
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
architecture document

603
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,960
well yes right now there is a little

604
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,320
little section on the architecture

605
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,559
which could be improved but that's going

606
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,960
to be the next discussion

607
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,918
improve or separated or blah blah right

608
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,840
but

609
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,279
lou just to your answer this is just

610
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:51,840
about the radio technologies sorry

611
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:51,840
it wasn't clear so it's background

612
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
was there any more comment on that lou

613
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
no

614
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,840
okay

615
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,600
have i muted myself can anyone hear me

616
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,360
yep we can hear you

617
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,639
oh perfect i was going to say just for

618
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,439
clarification

619
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,640
um there's a charter item to do that

620
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,159
exact analysis

621
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,120
lou for ietf technologies uh from my

622
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,919
understanding

623
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,158
this document is more about the linclair

624
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,840
technologies and their capabilities

625
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,080
and i know it's not pure link layer

626
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,879
technologies but the radio tech

627
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,199
and and what is the art of the possible

628
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:32,799
there is a second piece where we look at

629
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,480
ldp dlap bfd

630
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,320
etc which is alluded to in the

631
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,360
architecture document

632
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,918
which talks about ietf protocols

633
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,479
and then the in the milestone discussion

634
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,880
you know i

635
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
kind of pointed out that there is this

636
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,960
gap analysis document which

637
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,919
will have a more full-fledged version

638
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,640
yeah

639
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,679
yeah go ahead lou if you if you've got a

640
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,600
second point

641
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,720
well i i lost audio there i don't know

642
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,959
what happened uh

643
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
yeah thanks uh i i think you answered it

644
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,679
actually which is

645
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,039
it's not this document it's not the

646
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,159
architecture documents i went looking

647
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,799
for it in the architecture and didn't

648
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,480
see it either

649
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,400
is you're going to put it in a gap

650
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,080
analysis that's great thank you

651
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
yeah no trouble but there is a little

652
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,559
section somewhere in the architecture

653
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,679
document i

654
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,960
think yeah it is but it's not

655
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,480
substantive

656
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,480
right yes yes

657
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
oh the little reload so i have a

658
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,440
personal comment uh

659
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,799
to answer pascal's question about

660
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,919
do we have to have the same sub

661
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,600
sections for every technology my

662
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,000
personal view is no

663
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,918
if it's important and it helps to

664
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,720
explain the capabilities of the

665
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,120
technology

666
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,000
for example 5g i think believe it is

667
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,039
important

668
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,039
then sure have a section if it's

669
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,559
not so important for the technology i

670
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,158
don't think we need to

671
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,600
fight for symmetry say oh there you are

672
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,400
missing this subsection with this

673
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,840
particular

674
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,520
title i think we will we will take

675
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,279
we will spend more time crafting the

676
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,200
document and add words which

677
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:11,760
have very little function um so

678
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
i don't really care about balance as

679
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,760
long as the content has

680
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,760
has value does that help

681
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,600
it's a general comment it really helps

682
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,520
now on the specific of deployment

683
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:31,199
and spectrum um

684
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,559
i mean for wi-fi we all know right

685
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
now for wi-fi six especially it could be

686
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,279
interesting to have some clues

687
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
you know to give the group some

688
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,960
information about how well

689
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,120
of wi-fi six is is uh

690
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,000
fairing these days does it really deploy

691
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,158
quickly and

692
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,159
can we expect to get some services you

693
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,400
know widespread services

694
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,240
and spectrum there's also a very

695
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,279
interesting um

696
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,480
story to be told because there is a huge

697
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,640
fight for spectrum

698
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,559
in the for some of those technologies

699
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
again i'm thinking about wi-fi you know

700
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,600
the six gig has been granted and there's

701
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
more

702
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,959
um so maybe we could ask the wi-fi

703
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,200
people at least to give us a 6.3 section

704
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
um ldax i would be curious as well to

705
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,080
have you know um

706
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,520
something which which tells us about

707
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,039
what the you know

708
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,720
future uh the projections are for um

709
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,640
deployment and then um is there a chance

710
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,159
to get more spectrum and more bandwidth

711
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,640
in the future of lab i mean

712
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,159
that could also be interesting so

713
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,440
understand your general command i agree

714
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
with it

715
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,120
but still i really like this this 6.3

716
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,399
section that the 5g

717
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:45,439
guys have given us okay

718
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,439
okay anyone else have any comments

719
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,919
and it looks like niels is saying that

720
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
he can add that to the ldax draft as

721
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,799
well

722
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,879
i think there's something to be said for

723
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,360
given ldx has a draft that

724
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,240
this is me with my chair hat on now ldx

725
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,639
has a draft

726
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,600
in the working group it's probably

727
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,399
easier to

728
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,918
add that as a section to ldx as niels

729
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,959
suggests

730
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,399
rather than duplicating the text or or

731
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,440
having the text living in

732
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,760
in two different documents but

733
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
uh there's also a a jabber comment from

734
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,559
alexandra petrescu saying

735
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,120
as 5g gets deployed i don't hear news of

736
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,320
5g

737
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,760
features about qos i might be wrong

738
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,000
how about talking about 6g as well

739
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,440
i am not a 5g expert is there someone

740
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,279
who wishes to

741
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
step to the mic to respond

742
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,480
as alex says there is already a 6g

743
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,639
discussion list at the atf

744
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,679
uh so if if someone wants to

745
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,039
to talk to yanash and see

746
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,240
uh if they can work together on adding

747
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,679
some uh

748
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,559
6g int we already uh mentioned the

749
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,480
in wi-fi as it's i think you know

750
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,720
projecting for the future which is

751
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,679
like a near future it's not like in 20

752
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,919
years

753
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,799
uh is of interest i would be happy to

754
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,000
see some

755
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,639
some 6g text as well just to tell us

756
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,760
where 6g is going in terms of

757
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,720
determinism

758
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,000
you know uh how it builds on 5g and what

759
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,520
it improves

760
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
that would be that would be very neat

761
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,039
so so jumping the queue slightly myself

762
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,120
rick again

763
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,080
um i have a question about legacy

764
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,320
technologies

765
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,960
so from my last reading of the document

766
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,439
there's a lot of content about new

767
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,480
technologies with capabilities that

768
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,880
are applicable there

769
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,159
doesn't seem to be a lot of information

770
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,640
about

771
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:58,640
existing or or latent latency legacy

772
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,520
technologies that and how to manage some

773
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,360
of that

774
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,679
do you think that's out of scope for

775
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,918
this document

776
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
well when we scope the document trick we

777
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
we looked at

778
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,000
technologies that can be scheduled it

779
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,039
looked

780
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,919
like the um the common

781
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,399
uh point on technologies that we would

782
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,760
cover

783
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,199
because we we wanted to to see if we

784
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,399
could push them into

785
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,039
bonded latency okay and and so

786
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,918
we didn't try too much uh incorporating

787
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,720
you know the

788
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,559
humongous amount of non-deterministic

789
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,679
radios that are around here

790
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,120
yeah okay so that might might be a

791
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,559
another work item

792
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,360
for the group uh to uh

793
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,720
as we mature our proposed solutions to

794
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,000
these things and i spot

795
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,000
shinshan in the queue um to produce a

796
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,240
document saying

797
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
for some of these legacy technologies

798
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,440
here are some workarounds

799
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,439
etc that may work go ahead change

800
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,840
you may have to unmute your mic

801
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,840
right below your name at the top

802
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:22,000
there we go follow me yes

803
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:26,158
yes yeah i'm working in faculty

804
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,200
in cpp um i have one question

805
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,039
for 45g now we have the

806
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,159
dedicated spectrum to support the 5g

807
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,200
also for the 5gt has support

808
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,440
wi-fi even satellite as

809
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,240
as a access 10 access technology

810
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,679
i don't know whether we need a steel

811
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
consideration

812
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,000
this feature this the 5d can also all

813
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,279
kind of

814
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,279
access technology even for the wildland

815
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,158
technology

816
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,630
thank you uh pascal do you have a

817
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,720
comment

818
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,159
[Music]

819
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,760
well um no

820
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,080
i i don't i mean that's interesting

821
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:14,080
information but i'm not clear how it's

822
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,879
actionable for this document

823
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,199
maybe in the 5g section say that

824
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,120
actually 5g accepts number of

825
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,480
access technologies and there is kind of

826
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,959
a merge there or

827
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,960
what exactly uh is the

828
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:44,080
available for 5g they can use a multiple

829
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,600
path to approve the

830
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,120
reliability and throughput so our topic

831
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,080
is reliability

832
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,518
and the available one is if the multiple

833
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
paths is used

834
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,600
they can improve their mobility no no

835
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,720
the 5d support mobility they can support

836
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,158
the input of

837
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,279
improve the throughput they in can also

838
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,880
improve the reliability that's that's

839
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,720
i want to say yeah i mean that's that's

840
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,200
yeah we totally agree on this i mean

841
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,640
that's that's pretty much why we're here

842
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,039
um and the architecture as a picture

843
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,640
which

844
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,960
shows exactly this right wi-fi on uh

845
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,159
one stream and 5g on the other stream

846
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,000
pretty much

847
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,799
um now for this

848
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,240
document which is just uh explaining the

849
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,879
technologies

850
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,080
would you like to have a section which

851
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,399
which explains

852
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,918
this work like this this integration of

853
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:44,158
wi-fi in 5g

854
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,279
um i'm not i'm not against right i'm

855
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,279
just trying to understand

856
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,439
can i say more yeah

857
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,480
there's also uh i have a feature uh

858
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,799
algebra reliability and

859
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,679
low latency communication they also use

860
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,360
the

861
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,080
uh the the second path to improve the

862
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,520
reliability and the

863
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,560
throughput to download their latency

864
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,759
this means they use the multiple radio

865
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,639
station

866
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,320
to to to send or you see with the data

867
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,159
to improve the availability i don't know

868
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,399
whether also this technology

869
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:28,960
should be considered in the 5d part

870
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,960
so can i step in with my chair hat on um

871
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,079
what's important to remember is this is

872
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,199
the ietf

873
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,399
so we are looking at engineering

874
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,598
solutions between heterogeneous

875
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,279
technologies

876
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,839
what i mean by that is um 5g

877
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,760
may have a solution which uh will

878
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,399
cover uh

879
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,280
increasing reliability between satcom

880
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,560
systems

881
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:01,359
uh radio aware radio access networks

882
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,160
wi-fi technologies all within the 5g

883
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,200
technology

884
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:09,440
space and that that will be great

885
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,160
where the ietf's role comes in is

886
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,960
when data leaves that bubble of

887
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,520
technology

888
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,160
and has to transition across to another

889
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,359
network

890
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,560
using different technology but from our

891
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,078
working group perspective

892
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,279
still needs those reliability assurances

893
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,800
those slas so

894
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,599
yes i think there is um

895
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,320
a value in having some more words in the

896
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,200
5g

897
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,800
section to say 5g is more than just

898
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,359
radio access networks for

899
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,599
for handsets it also has these other

900
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,000
features to talk about wi-fi and satcom

901
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,480
that that people may not notice

902
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,040
which may well be useful for our further

903
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,079
work and analysis to understand

904
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,359
but the point of the working group is

905
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,119
is not to duplicate what the 5g the

906
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,560
3gpp lte work is is doing but is to look

907
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,839
at

908
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,480
moving data from the good work that 3gpp

909
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,920
are doing

910
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,560
off to the work that i are doing or

911
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
other

912
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,799
existing legacy networks or whatever

913
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,439
does that is that clear or am i just

914
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,440
talking now

915
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,880
i think what rick is saying is that this

916
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
this document

917
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,760
is trying to harmonize the coexistence

918
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,279
of these various technologies

919
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,800
and that's going to be the focus and

920
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,280
that's why this

921
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,880
technology draft is written the way it

922
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,880
is to lay the groundwork for that

923
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,040
so i'm watching the time uh pascal

924
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,720
you're eating into your next

925
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,320
presentation does anyone else have any

926
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,959
more comments on the technologies

927
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,440
or shall we move on to the architecture

928
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,440
discussion

929
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
i think crack on pascal there is uh i'm

930
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,000
just watching that there's some

931
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,680
interesting stuff going on in the jabber

932
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,200
chat but if you queue up your next

933
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,240
presentation pascal

934
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,160
i'll just uh

935
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,279
i think there's just i just don't have

936
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,960
jabba

937
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,960
do you have another slide pascal

938
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,399
i i don't even know if i can talk

939
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,000
because oh no we hear you

940
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,079
we're here um

941
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,920
so let me check i was i was actually

942
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,960
presenting preparing for the next slide

943
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,160
well for this one

944
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,119
the question was mostly uh do do we uh

945
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,200
want to discuss

946
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,480
uh what's the path to adoption for this

947
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,640
document

948
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,160
um and and basically yes i had another

949
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,319
slide which which

950
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,640
asks um if we

951
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,560
uh if we are missing a topic and shushan

952
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,879
maybe uh was telling us that that could

953
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,839
be

954
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,599
more a little bit more in the 5g um and

955
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,200
and that's to be discussed with the 5g

956
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,040
authors if they want to discuss a little

957
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,000
bit more about the integration of wi-fi

958
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,480
and

959
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,920
5g underneath uh just to let us know

960
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,760
that it exists

961
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,839
um so the the other question i had was

962
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,839
um if we want more um

963
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,200
on the on the prime statement piece

964
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,078
basically uh

965
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,078
but okay okay i mean the big question is

966
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,760
how do we proceed to a croplasco i i

967
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,520
don't see that we want to change the

968
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,920
structure dramatically i

969
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,359
hear from the from this call that we are

970
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,880
pretty much okay

971
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,560
uh and so the question is what's the

972
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,520
path to work up last call should we

973
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,880
should we already

974
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,520
um ask for a reviewer or something

975
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,119
to to progress towards welcome preschool

976
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,640
i think that's a great idea

977
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,640
to ask for reviewers

978
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,598
yeah i'm just gonna say exactly the same

979
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,880
thing

980
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,920
carry on eve um i personally would like

981
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,640
to review it

982
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,440
more officially so i'm happy to step

983
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,000
forward for that

984
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,000
are there other people um on the list

985
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,520
and and everybody's audio

986
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,400
you don't have to even put yourself in

987
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,160
the queue for us to hear your audio

988
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,960
um so if you unmute your mic

989
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,440
and you'd like to raise your hand we can

990
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,200
do a hand raise there is a hand raised

991
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,119
tool in meat echo we could try and

992
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,160
experiment to see whether that works do

993
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,520
it

994
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,040
um i'm gonna do it as a two-part

995
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,720
first i'm going to have a show of hands

996
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,720
to say who has read the document

997
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,759
and let me just make sure i get the

998
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,040
right name for the document while i talk

999
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,839
about this one this is

1000
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,839
the technologies before i

1001
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,680
a very quick thing so you should see a

1002
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
little ping to say

1003
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,640
a show of hands has been requested

1004
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,760
um and oh right so you have to click on

1005
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,480
the

1006
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,079
yes you can choose not to answer because

1007
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,599
you're not paying attention

1008
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,000
or you can either be positive or

1009
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,119
negative

1010
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,119
it's very high etf

1011
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,079
it's not a bad system actually uh okay

1012
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,599
so we're looking at about 50 50 from

1013
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,119
those who've noticed that this

1014
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,040
or have worked out how to make the tool

1015
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,119
work okay

1016
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,800
i'm gonna that's fairly positive i'm

1017
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:39,839
gonna add another quick one now

1018
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,839
um which is who would

1019
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,839
so

1020
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,319
oh enter doesn't work there we go so uh

1021
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,560
this is are you willing to do a full

1022
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,079
review of the draft i.e

1023
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,560
um you know a

1024
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,440
review from typos to i don't understand

1025
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,599
this sentence

1026
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,880
to i think the section is in the wrong

1027
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,640
place uh

1028
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,480
including i think we've forgotten all

1029
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,759
this technology you know as as

1030
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,040
transcendent said

1031
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,839
um i'm sorry my pronunciation of asian

1032
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,839
names is not good

1033
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,400
but and so uh i guess

1034
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,960
um for ethan's sake since he is helping

1035
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,079
us with the notes those of you who have

1036
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,400
raised your hand

1037
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,680
uh who are willing to do that kind of

1038
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,800
thorough

1039
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,078
review if you could speak up let us know

1040
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,839
who you are

1041
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,839
either verbally or in the chat that'd be

1042
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
great

1043
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,200
i'm also making the assumption that

1044
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,480
i'm watching the numbers on on the show

1045
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,480
of hands and

1046
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,520
the numbers are about the same as the

1047
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,800
people who said

1048
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,160
they had read it so it sounds i'm i'm

1049
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,680
assuming the people who are

1050
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,520
offering to review are mostly the same

1051
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,000
people who have read it already

1052
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,000
so yes

1053
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,480
yes it's saying and eve and they're two

1054
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,040
other people

1055
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,040
who are you

1056
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,480
it's not critical you don't need written

1057
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,599
permission from the chairs

1058
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,200
but so so please yes i think to answer

1059
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,160
pascal's question the next step is

1060
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,480
people please

1061
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
um it sounds like the authors think this

1062
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,240
document is getting

1063
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,919
pretty stable so now is a great chance

1064
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,279
to have a deep review

1065
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,800
and then we can make a decision about

1066
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,800
is it ready for last call depending on

1067
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,920
the feedback from reviewers

1068
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
sound good sounds great

1069
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,400
and it looks like in the jabber that

1070
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,400
adam

1071
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,480
oh adam save me from tell us how to

1072
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,359
pronounce your name

1073
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:06,079
whitchika whitaker no way

1074
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,480
anyway it looks more complicated okay

1075
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,000
thank you for that help

1076
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,839
pascal do you want to move on to the

1077
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,839
next presentation

1078
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:19,599
make sure the audio works again oh sorry

1079
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,520
we've got rust

1080
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,599
we've got russ in the queue sorry go

1081
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:30,800
ahead russ

1082
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,640
if you can hear me my hand down it told

1083
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,200
you to let me

1084
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,720
oh okay okay i was having the same

1085
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,680
problem you just have to click on that

1086
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,078
show of hands tool

1087
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,720
the second time it toggles it away but

1088
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,040
also the

1089
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,839
and then click on the participant list

1090
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,359
sorry russ did you have a comment

1091
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,880
it was addressed by the last thing so no

1092
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,480
okay right so moving on because i'm

1093
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,599
watching the time um

1094
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,560
pascal go ahead yes so

1095
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,680
um this is about the architecture

1096
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,599
framework document

1097
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,040
uh really it's it there are three

1098
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,000
documents in one because

1099
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,040
um that's kind of a for some things it's

1100
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,960
a placeholder

1101
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,720
and one of the things that i would have

1102
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,480
uh love to see

1103
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,839
today or maybe another remaining list

1104
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,000
later is

1105
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,359
decide what stays in this document what

1106
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,599
goes away

1107
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,759
what serves as a seed for another

1108
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,599
document etc

1109
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,640
so um the requirements are still pretty

1110
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,119
much the same

1111
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,680
and um it kind of boils down to the use

1112
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,079
cases document that carlos

1113
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,720
has discussed and we'll be discussing

1114
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,440
more

1115
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,359
um if we if we boil down everything

1116
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
we've seen so far

1117
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,960
i mean my current understanding and the

1118
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,119
other person's submission

1119
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,319
is that we have two major use cases in

1120
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,720
the real world for what we are doing

1121
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,040
one of them is uh a bit what

1122
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,399
was uh sorry i can't pronounce your name

1123
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,440
what was alluding to

1124
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,880
when it's done inside 5g uh but that

1125
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,440
could be done at layer 3

1126
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,040
uh as well and that's what roy is about

1127
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,400
is um

1128
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,359
using more than one access link and and

1129
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,720
possibly uh of heterogeneous

1130
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,640
technologies

1131
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,919
to achieve a more reliable end-to-end

1132
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,118
transmission

1133
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,800
in which case the assumption would be

1134
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,560
that the the radio link

1135
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:29,119
is the one that is

1136
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:30,960
the most uh susceptible of loss

1137
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,160
and so that's the one we want to protect

1138
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,319
by having redundancy

1139
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,598
etc uh with the helpful thinking that

1140
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,880
the rest of the path has a more fixed

1141
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,480
and

1142
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,280
bonded latency and uh whatever is behind

1143
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,800
it's wired maybe it's that net or maybe

1144
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,000
it's just good enough

1145
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,560
and and so we we really care about um

1146
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,839
what's hap what happens on the on the

1147
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,799
terminal equipment

1148
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,799
um on the stay and how the traffic is

1149
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,880
distributed over multiple

1150
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,160
links like this 5g and wi-fi which are

1151
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,880
illustrated up there

1152
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,960
so that's the first case we protect the

1153
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:13,040
radio access

1154
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:16,560
second case is is more complex

1155
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,359
is when we're part not of the host but

1156
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,960
of the rotting fabric

1157
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:26,000
and in that case what we try to do

1158
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,280
is build a complex

1159
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,960
path that we call a truck um

1160
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,400
across possibly a radio mesh

1161
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:39,920
and so what we're interested in

1162
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,920
is monitor uh what goes inside this

1163
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,240
particular track like the real time

1164
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,599
operation of every link

1165
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,118
in that small we hopefully small track

1166
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,760
and making um

1167
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:54,800
a decision almost on a per packet basis

1168
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,119
on a per

1169
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,440
few packet basis to ensure the dsla

1170
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,839
of latency and reliability that we have

1171
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,040
for this flow

1172
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:08,839
in this case we we introduced this

1173
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,440
concept of a

1174
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,799
pse that we discussed since the

1175
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,000
inception of the group

1176
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,760
at the buff which would be a function

1177
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,160
departed from the pce

1178
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,599
that computes this path and that makes

1179
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,799
this

1180
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,880
short term almost instantaneous decision

1181
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,040
of how much of the redundancy is being

1182
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,680
used for this particular packet

1183
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,160
so these are basically the two use cases

1184
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,960
which

1185
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,319
seem to boil down from the use cases

1186
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,160
documents and and

1187
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,440
from what we've been talking about so

1188
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,640
far so they are described in the

1189
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,800
architecture

1190
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,400
uh it's more like the the problem

1191
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
statement piece of the architecture

1192
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,400
document

1193
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,000
and uh now if we if we miss some

1194
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,040
abstractions some things we need to look

1195
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,760
at and solve

1196
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,640
in this working group then clearly we

1197
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,200
need to know

1198
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:59,200
because we need to add stuff to this

1199
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,720
section

1200
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,879
now the since last atf and sorry it's

1201
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,759
not actually published i can publish it

1202
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,720
today

1203
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,760
but um the document has been through a

1204
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,319
bit of

1205
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,440
reshuffling it's not really a lot of new

1206
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,558
text

1207
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,640
it's mostly uh yet another

1208
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,559
reorganization we discussed it at the

1209
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,480
last atf we said hey

1210
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,839
this section and this section they seem

1211
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,079
to relate

1212
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
to to the prime statement so now we have

1213
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,720
a section two

1214
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,240
which is the problem and then

1215
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,879
as if said we initially had a an item

1216
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,720
on on prime statement which is now kind

1217
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,400
of this this section two

1218
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,000
so in the section two we give the

1219
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,520
terminology so if we want to describe

1220
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,079
prime we need to agree on terms

1221
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,000
what do we mean by this in particular we

1222
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,359
need to agree on what reliability and

1223
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,480
viability means

1224
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,319
um so we go into some some details about

1225
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,280
this

1226
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,440
now we we mentioned as you can see on

1227
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,119
the right the section section 2.3 we go

1228
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,160
through the two use cases that i just

1229
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,920
presented

1230
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,279
so the question to the group there is

1231
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,280
obviously did we meet

1232
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,960
miss like yet another important

1233
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,440
situation that we want to cover this

1234
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,440
framework

1235
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,680
and then there is this section 2.4 that

1236
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,040
even

1237
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:21,359
lou i've been talking about which is

1238
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,880
kind of yet another work item that we

1239
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,920
had

1240
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,079
which is uh this this uh positioning the

1241
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,559
existing work at the atf and positioning

1242
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,839
uh providing a gap analysis or something

1243
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,839
so since we don't have any other

1244
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,040
document i cannot use this as a

1245
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,839
placeholder

1246
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,759
um but i didn't get to write too much

1247
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,640
into it and and maybe i'm not even the

1248
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,720
right person to write into it

1249
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,240
now the second point is also that maybe

1250
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,520
that would be a great place

1251
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,839
to solicit people's input for people to

1252
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,839
have i mean

1253
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:56,558
yeah the door is open always been but uh

1254
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,760
if this goes

1255
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,559
if this becomes a work group document um

1256
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,599
then the work group will be entitled to

1257
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,000
do whatever it likes

1258
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,760
into this right i'm just not the right

1259
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,240
person probably i'm not an expert in

1260
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,520
delete

1261
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:13,439
uh i have some clues about that net uh

1262
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,800
but still i mean some other people who

1263
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,839
could help a lot

1264
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,079
um we need text on oam and and

1265
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,119
now we have authors which which work in

1266
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,400
both row and

1267
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:26,319
and uh that net so they could produce

1268
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,160
some text on oam etc i mean

1269
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,440
there's there's a lot that could be done

1270
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,399
for which i would uh

1271
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,800
not be the right author um so that's

1272
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,839
when

1273
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:39,440
at some point sorry pascal

1274
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,880
it's rick um my suggestion would be that

1275
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,640
uh looking at this

1276
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,079
uh section 2.4 i think that's a document

1277
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,480
in its own right

1278
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,680
i think it's a charter item to cover

1279
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,480
that and and yes

1280
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,440
i probably am a dlap expert so i can

1281
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,119
certainly

1282
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,599
help put some of the text together for

1283
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,559
that but i wonder whether in the

1284
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,160
architecture framework draft the section

1285
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,520
two you have here should be

1286
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:09,040
much shorter and call out to

1287
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,839
the working group use cases document the

1288
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,119
uh working uh the working group

1289
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,599
technologies document

1290
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,400
and hopefully the uh the forthcoming um

1291
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,680
related work in the ietf document you

1292
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
know and call out

1293
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,960
from here so to say this architecture

1294
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,200
framework is attempting to address

1295
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,880
the problems that the following problems

1296
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,439
as listed in

1297
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,319
this problem statement or or whatever to

1298
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,880
do it as a

1299
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:38,240
as a reference rather than um inserting

1300
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,559
all the text in here i think it will

1301
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,000
make the document more manageable

1302
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,520
that's exactly what i'm asking i mean

1303
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,240
we're copying agreement the question is

1304
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,359
really

1305
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,160
uh this section two that's why i kind of

1306
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:53,119
structure things into three blocks is

1307
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,720
um could we take a block away but then

1308
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,960
it needs to have a placeholder

1309
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,399
and since there was none so for now i i

1310
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,680
just did it this way

1311
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,480
but i'm completely uh happy to to

1312
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,078
to take some pieces off and i just

1313
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,440
wanted to capture whatever i had to make

1314
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,559
sure it was written somewhere because

1315
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,200
right now we don't have this other

1316
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,000
document

1317
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,319
so if we agree that that we should have

1318
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,680
a document on related work or a prime

1319
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,480
statement document

1320
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,118
i'm not 100 sure we need a prime

1321
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,880
statement

1322
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,880
if we because we are we have the use

1323
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,240
cases and we have this

1324
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,680
introduction section um and and we

1325
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:32,479
you know uh if you look at it section

1326
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,759
2.3 is like one or two pages

1327
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,000
uh section 2.2 but

1328
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
i think it's kind of important it does

1329
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,480
two or three pages

1330
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,839
it's not huge okay um the

1331
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,839
2.4 would become huge if it was done

1332
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:47,839
seriously

1333
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,599
and that's why it should be done as its

1334
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,520
own document

1335
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,680
um it is a charter item so

1336
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,640
so soon as it's there i mean i am happy

1337
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,359
to to kind of

1338
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,118
replace that by by a pointer and maybe a

1339
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,359
summary of what the other document does

1340
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,520
and

1341
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:06,480
look at this look at that so that that

1342
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,680
would be neat

1343
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:14,800
um yeah so so easy for 2.2 and 2.3

1344
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,000
ah you know they're not fat are they no

1345
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,720
and i think they have to sorry

1346
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,480
continuing

1347
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,480
i think they have to be there because

1348
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,520
you have to scope this document

1349
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,319
because the the use cases document is is

1350
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,160
general

1351
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,599
uh and the technologies document and the

1352
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,558
requirements they're quite general and

1353
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,440
quite broad

1354
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,319
and you need to uh define them a bit

1355
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:37,119
more accurately in this document to say

1356
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,680
this framework applies to these use

1357
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,559
cases

1358
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,359
and and these requirements served so i

1359
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,640
think this is

1360
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:44,400
quite as long as they're short i think

1361
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,400
they're perfect i think you have to have

1362
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,680
them

1363
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,160
okay so uh after that we and they never

1364
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,160
knew where to go framework exactly but

1365
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,640
because the framework for me is like all

1366
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,799
the the contacts all the base

1367
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,879
uh but you know we don't have a clear

1368
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:04,319
definition of what framework is

1369
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,839
um but um so i get i gave all the

1370
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:09,040
background information in that

1371
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,720
uh section three now so as you see the

1372
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
the existing document is kind of

1373
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,680
repackaged into framework and

1374
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,040
architecture

1375
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,640
and by framework here i mean um

1376
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,240
yes all the backgrounds so explaining

1377
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,558
what the parallel functions are

1378
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,680
explaining what the tracks are uh

1379
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,720
explaining what can

1380
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,000
what can be done at the pc timescale

1381
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:34,319
versus what we want to do here um

1382
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,119
so um that that's what section three is

1383
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:37,279
now

1384
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,440
and i called it framework but it's it

1385
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,440
could create background as well

1386
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:47,119
and uh i'm open to to to any other

1387
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,520
name and um then uh the

1388
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,440
section four is what we have now for

1389
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,359
architecture so we provided

1390
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,119
the model which kind of inherits from

1391
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:58,160
the net model

1392
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,200
um we discussed the psc the

1393
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,640
section for that too and uh

1394
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:07,040
we discuss oam section 4.3

1395
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,598
then this discussion of flow

1396
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,000
identification versus path

1397
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:13,359
identification

1398
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,640
which um for which basically that net as

1399
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,558
as a um as a provision

1400
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,879
which is not fully in line with what

1401
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,520
sixties is doing because six dish

1402
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,960
has a flow identifier which is separated

1403
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,000
from the five tuple

1404
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,920
so we kind of we try to kind of put that

1405
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,240
together

1406
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,359
the key thing that we want to do here is

1407
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,959
to

1408
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:40,000
uh to show that we kind of decouple

1409
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:44,559
the the path indication from

1410
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:47,440
the flow indication so if one wants to

1411
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,079
multiple flows could be injected in one

1412
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,599
path

1413
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,520
if you like which enables us to to to

1414
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,680
have separate oem

1415
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,799
packets which don't necessarily have the

1416
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,680
same five tuple

1417
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,599
or six double and still fly within the

1418
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,759
same track

1419
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,960
so we have the track id and we have the

1420
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,960
um

1421
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,160
the the flow id which are kind of

1422
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,920
separate

1423
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:16,319
um then we

1424
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,839
discuss um how we do the

1425
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,079
performing decision and there are

1426
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,040
basically the usual the two usual

1427
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,440
methods one of them is the source route

1428
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,240
like

1429
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,160
the ingress of this track places

1430
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,919
everything in the packet so that all the

1431
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,640
nodes along the track will know what to

1432
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,240
do

1433
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,319
so it's kind of you know the segment

1434
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
routing the source routing

1435
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:39,680
uh type of approach but here it's going

1436
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:41,759
to be describing not a linear path a to

1437
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,078
b to c to d but it's going to describe

1438
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,680
what happens on a two two-dimensional

1439
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,000
two-dimensional graph

1440
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,040
so like a dietary graph so so there's

1441
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,559
some things

1442
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
uh there are some things that need to be

1443
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,920
done to signal that which don't exist at

1444
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,799
the atf because source routing has

1445
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,799
always been surreal

1446
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,359
then there is the discussion on

1447
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,760
encapsulation encapsulation

1448
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:05,279
and which kind of goes with the flow

1449
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,880
identification

1450
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,640
and so that describes the track

1451
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,160
operation it generates a lot from

1452
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,400
sixties

1453
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,720
but an enroll because there's a lot of

1454
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,880
work happening at raw and our document

1455
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,640
going through the asg right now which

1456
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:20,480
from which this document inherits as

1457
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,960
well

1458
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,839
and then there are the the usual

1459
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,240
securities

1460
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:30,319
so right now so since the big

1461
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,359
change has been uh reshuffling the

1462
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,599
section

1463
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:36,319
uh the feedback you know i would like to

1464
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:38,480
see uh today or on the mailing list

1465
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,440
is about the structure i mean are we

1466
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,000
missing

1467
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,240
important topics i already understand

1468
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,079
that 2.4 should go away and i would be

1469
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,919
happy to to see that happen as soon as

1470
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,640
you know the document shows up

1471
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,319
that would change the text for the

1472
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,879
framework are there components that are

1473
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,520
missing

1474
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,559
same thing or you know whatever should

1475
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,280
go there

1476
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,599
and for the architecture same thing did

1477
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,559
i

1478
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,920
did i do the right restructuring do we

1479
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,760
agree that

1480
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,880
you know the what i call section four

1481
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
the architecture is really an

1482
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,319
architecture it's really what

1483
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,400
people expected from this document is

1484
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,119
there a a big thing that's missing right

1485
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,480
now we

1486
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:20,000
we have the oam the psc the flows

1487
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,880
um is there anything else

1488
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,160
um and then well you know at some point

1489
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,000
i've done what i could

1490
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,558
because that's that's the limit of those

1491
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,200
personal submissions is it's it's

1492
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,480
a few of us mind at some point we hit

1493
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,078
our limit and that's when the working

1494
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,400
group should take over because

1495
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,920
many more minds so it sounds like maybe

1496
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,079
a next step would be

1497
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,400
to well first this this particular

1498
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,520
version is not posted yet

1499
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,680
so okay

1500
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,720
um but then you're so really soliciting

1501
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,598
the feedback

1502
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,959
and um once we go through that phase it

1503
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,480
it's likely that we're

1504
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,960
we're one step closer to uh asking for

1505
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,960
adoption

1506
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,880
so pascal uh rick here um

1507
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:12,240
i really want to read the new document

1508
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,720
um this is me speaking personally um

1509
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,680
i'm very happy to help on this because i

1510
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,959
think this is

1511
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,598
actually a really key part of getting on

1512
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,119
with

1513
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:25,440
doing the raw work so i uh

1514
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,880
even if this document gets adopted by

1515
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,599
the working group and completely

1516
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,440
rewritten

1517
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,480
it has to exist so i am happily offering

1518
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,559
to help

1519
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,160
get it to the state where the working

1520
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,760
group is happy to adopt it

1521
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,920
so i'm i'm offering help here uh

1522
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,839
the sooner we can get the the latest

1523
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,440
draft out would be great i think it's

1524
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,359
very important for the working group

1525
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,000
this is now me with my chair hat on

1526
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:51,040
please working group read this document

1527
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,400
because

1528
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:57,279
i think it has a lot of important

1529
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,240
introduces a lot of important framework

1530
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,160
is a good word

1531
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,919
architecture is also a good word it

1532
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,720
tries to set down

1533
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,599
um a lot of the ideas that are being

1534
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:09,759
discussed

1535
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:13,040
informally in a formal manner and if

1536
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:16,160
if there are concepts that are not clear

1537
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:19,839
or are incorrect this is the time to

1538
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,000
to say um because personally i think

1539
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:24,078
this is the right approach

1540
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,119
but the point of the working group is is

1541
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,040
it's not

1542
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,160
just my opinion it's everybody's opinion

1543
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,759
so so please

1544
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:34,558
please read this rick

1545
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,359
two things uh first one is uh send me

1546
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:36,880
your git id

1547
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:38,558
uh i'm not sure the whole group is

1548
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,480
authorized on git on this so

1549
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,160
but does it get so that's that's easy

1550
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,400
please

1551
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,240
for the harder piece um you know

1552
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,599
i mean what group adoption is not even a

1553
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,640
guarantee that the document will be

1554
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,960
shipped one day

1555
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,440
but at least it gives the ownership for

1556
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,599
me that's the step where

1557
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,520
the group says yes this is serious work

1558
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:02,240
and then we want to take it over

1559
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,759
and so um and and to get those reviews

1560
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,720
that we're talking about and to make the

1561
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,000
dates that we want

1562
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,879
which are kind of aggressive um i think

1563
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,880
one group less core

1564
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,240
trigger those reviews that we are

1565
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:21,759
talking about

1566
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:25,598
so why don't we say that you post this

1567
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:28,640
and people read it and we have some

1568
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,400
uh that we ask on the mailing list

1569
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,920
whether it's ready for adoption before

1570
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,160
any of those changes

1571
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,119
that as is do people feel like it should

1572
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,118
be adopted because it is fairly mature

1573
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:41,119
even if it has some of these pieces

1574
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,760
missing

1575
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,760
go ahead lou

1576
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:50,399
hi uh hopefully you can hear me this

1577
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,400
time we can you're a little quiet

1578
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,879
okay um i'm now eating the microphone uh

1579
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,640
i think um you know filling in some of

1580
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,079
these spots or at least identifying

1581
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,960
where the gaps are would be really

1582
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:03,200
helpful

1583
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,880
uh prior to adoption because then we

1584
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,000
have an idea of what work is

1585
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,599
is remaining and sort of what we're

1586
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:13,440
signing up to um certainly

1587
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:15,359
i don't wouldn't expect the document to

1588
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,359
be so polished that we'd immediately go

1589
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,680
to last call so you know i understand

1590
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,440
there's

1591
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,680
there's going to be more work to be done

1592
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,680
but at least flagging what that work is

1593
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,680
i think would be helpful prior to the

1594
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,879
adoption call

1595
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,919
so lou i would counter that

1596
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,680
by saying i think this document

1597
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:38,880
is critical to the working group

1598
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,359
the document that describes what the

1599
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,760
working group is attempting to achieve

1600
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:45,279
to solve the problems as defined in the

1601
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,400
use cases

1602
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,440
and therefore i i personally rather than

1603
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,880
chair

1604
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,240
think adopting a document of this type

1605
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,839
as soon as possible

1606
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:01,038
keeps the momentum in the working group

1607
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:02,799
yeah i'd like to i completely support

1608
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:04,720
adopting as quickly as possible which is

1609
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,440
why i'm i'm saying let's flag the open

1610
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,640
issues

1611
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,839
i'm happy to unlist once this this

1612
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,520
version is posted put comments out there

1613
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,920
anything that i think is missing

1614
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,559
obviously you've flagged a couple things

1615
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,839
um

1616
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,480
like uh the dla part i think we're

1617
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:23,200
missing

1618
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,920
um you know how we tie into the rest of

1619
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,399
that net

1620
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,240
and normal traffic engineering and

1621
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,480
normal layering concepts

1622
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,759
uh i'm happy to put that on you know in

1623
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,640
in email

1624
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,599
um and you know be more specific as what

1625
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,799
i think is

1626
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:41,520
should be identified

1627
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:44,880
okay that's great um but i don't think

1628
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:47,520
that should prevent adoption

1629
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,280
and i i think we differ here i i think

1630
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,160
if this doesn't show the direction we're

1631
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,480
headed

1632
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,640
um then you know personally i wouldn't

1633
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,000
support adoption without flagging those

1634
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:59,680
things

1635
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,240
okay so i have a suggestion with my

1636
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:05,359
chair hat on

1637
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:08,000
how about the chairs uh pascal

1638
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:09,440
puts out uh the updated document as soon

1639
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,880
as he can

1640
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:17,680
and four weeks after that

1641
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,680
we have a call for adoption

1642
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:24,720
so that gives everyone four weeks to

1643
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:25,440
read review and decide whether this is

1644
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,558
the

1645
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,240
correct direction for the working group

1646
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,319
to be taking its work whether this

1647
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,439
document is

1648
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,720
even if it's just even if it's far from

1649
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,119
perfect in a text

1650
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,160
sense is the is the technology and

1651
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,240
approach correct

1652
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,440
that that would be my criteria for

1653
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,558
deciding

1654
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,240
um and after four weeks we can we can

1655
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,880
make an adoption call does that work

1656
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:52,640
for pascal and does that work for the

1657
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,640
working group

1658
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:56,240
well since i was named it certainly

1659
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,879
works and what also works

1660
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:00,240
is during those four weeks lowered you

1661
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,559
joined the document and

1662
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,680
helped to contribute to species that

1663
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,720
i've been missing

1664
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:09,680
because i pretty went as far as i knew

1665
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,078
um and for that net i could add a little

1666
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,839
bit

1667
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,599
but you know for tea and everything i

1668
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:17,119
mean if lu would be

1669
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,440
so much better so um if the two of you

1670
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,039
can

1671
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,559
can help on this document in this

1672
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,000
document you know for

1673
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,319
during those four weeks then we would

1674
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,599
have something a lot more mature to to

1675
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:31,119
give to the group in four weeks

1676
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,119
you can find the time to help us

1677
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:39,919
or another.net ldp expert

1678
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:48,078
i need that net we need t uh you know

1679
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:50,240
so i mean lou i can't show you anymore

1680
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,640
but if you're willing to to because you

1681
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,038
know

1682
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,000
you have a mind of what you want to see

1683
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,839
there i mean

1684
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,480
the best would be that actually you

1685
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:00,480
propose it

1686
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,720
yeah lou we don't know whether your

1687
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:10,000
silence is agreement

1688
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:12,240
but we're no we're not scenery yes

1689
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,839
uh that works for me i'll i'll send

1690
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,359
something to the list

1691
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:21,279
sounds great okay um it obviously

1692
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:23,920
thanks thank you so much

1693
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,640
this is i'm sorry eve i was not too

1694
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,359
clear what

1695
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,078
lou told us uh there are two pieces

1696
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,920
where uh

1697
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,920
we need work one is this architecture

1698
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,960
document

1699
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:38,799
where we um we probably

1700
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,880
want to see how this fits into the rest

1701
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:41,680
of the the framework of the atf like

1702
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,559
what's the

1703
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:45,279
what's that net i have some text a

1704
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,359
little bit

1705
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,799
of text about that net that there's a

1706
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:49,839
new text that will be published today

1707
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,280
you will find

1708
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:56,558
uh positioning this work versus the the

1709
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,480
the data planning that net but uh it's

1710
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,280
i'm sure luke can do a lot better and

1711
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,119
improve it

1712
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,520
now there's also discussion on um

1713
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:06,480
how that fits with the the existing

1714
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:09,119
tooling

1715
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:11,599
like like how would we play with dilip

1716
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:14,000
or how would we play with other things

1717
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,760
and and that that has to be split

1718
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
between this new document that we don't

1719
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,319
have for which i just have a placeholder

1720
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,079
uh you know the gap analysis and blah

1721
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,960
and uh the integration of those

1722
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,480
technologies

1723
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,079
into the architecture which would be

1724
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,400
here so so

1725
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,280
and we need all this so you just want to

1726
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,640
make

1727
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,240
to to your right orders to to structure

1728
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,279
things and say this goes there this goes

1729
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:40,640
there

1730
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,640
okay completely correct clarifying that

1731
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:48,160
so uh watching time i think

1732
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:50,000
uh we are ready yeah so

1733
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,520
what do we got next niels we've got

1734
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,839
carlos no it's called

1735
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,280
sorry carlos i've miscounted you carry

1736
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,400
on carlos

1737
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:01,520
and carlos are you good to present

1738
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:11,839
yourself he is now

1739
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:11,839
i have granted his screen

1740
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,120
can you hear me now sorry it was muted

1741
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,158
yes

1742
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,318
we can hear you now okay so

1743
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:29,839
hi everybody i'm carlos bernardos

1744
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:33,120
presenting on behalf of my

1745
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:35,359
co-authors the of the use case draft

1746
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,399
today in this meeting i just wanted to

1747
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,120
do a very brief

1748
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,599
presentation just summarizing what we

1749
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:42,960
have

1750
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,920
and mostly requesting some some help

1751
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,198
input from from the working group so

1752
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,920
currently we have

1753
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:50,639
eight use cases in the document that are

1754
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,920
described

1755
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,520
they are the same ones that were

1756
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,359
described in the in the previous

1757
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,199
situation

1758
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,199
aeronautical communications amusement

1759
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,919
parks wires for industrial applications

1760
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:03,120
probably on video wireless gaming uav

1761
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,199
platooning and control

1762
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:10,640
edge what is control and emergencies

1763
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:13,599
and for each of these eight use cases

1764
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,400
we have the following structure is

1765
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,040
basically

1766
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,839
the same for all but for the first one

1767
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,759
that they

1768
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:21,439
that is just the use case description i

1769
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:24,479
think is called motivation so i

1770
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:26,719
need to basically

1771
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:27,919
modify that but it's a very minor thing

1772
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,198
so for each of them

1773
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,880
we have initial description motivation

1774
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:34,879
of the use case

1775
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,719
in general without going into all the

1776
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,640
raw details then we go into the

1777
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:42,080
specifics that are relevant for

1778
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:45,279
for raw the challenges that this

1779
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:48,318
each of the use cases brings or poses

1780
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:51,600
regarding reliability and availability

1781
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:54,640
in whereas scenarios

1782
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,520
then a very short uh

1783
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,040
subsection on the need for wireless

1784
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,360
which is pretty obvious in

1785
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,800
most of the cases but still is there and

1786
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:05,199
then the key section

1787
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,800
in my opinion for each of the use cases

1788
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,400
that is the requirements

1789
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,880
that as the chairs mentioned before

1790
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:13,839
these use cases is not only kind of

1791
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,880
filling the gap

1792
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,120
of documenting the use cases but also

1793
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,719
trying to identify and enumerate the

1794
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,159
different requirements for the raw

1795
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,679
solutions

1796
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:28,879
uh that are required so these are the

1797
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,480
this is the current structure and with

1798
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,360
that in mind

1799
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,040
this is the key slide from my side now

1800
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:38,639
this is a working group document

1801
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:41,280
so basically i'm i'm here to request

1802
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,159
input from all of you and i have a set

1803
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,599
of questions

1804
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:45,679
of course there may be other questions

1805
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,520
that i missed there may be other

1806
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:48,719
feedback that you want to provide and

1807
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,199
that will be always

1808
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,320
welcome and very much appreciated but

1809
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,759
from our

1810
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,519
side these are the main questions that

1811
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,800
we have first one

1812
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,800
are the use cases rather than

1813
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,960
representative so are this

1814
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,400
do you think that we are missing any use

1815
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,719
case do you think that there are some

1816
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:07,120
use cases that are not representative

1817
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:09,199
enough for the raw

1818
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,400
scenarios so this is a first question

1819
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:13,678
that we would like to get

1820
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,679
feedback on on the main list

1821
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:17,199
the second question is basically related

1822
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,840
to to the former one

1823
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:22,879
are we missing anything that you think

1824
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:26,159
we should be documenting

1825
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,640
then is a structure that i briefly

1826
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:29,759
presented before for each of these cases

1827
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,080
appropriate

1828
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,719
do you think that maybe we need to

1829
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:36,719
remove some things like maybe the

1830
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,320
the need for wireless is too obvious and

1831
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:41,199
it's not needed or

1832
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:44,159
maybe you want to structure the

1833
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:47,839
requirements in a different way

1834
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:50,000
whatever the thing is it will help

1835
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,520
the document improve towards meeting its

1836
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,400
goal

1837
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:54,800
and then the last question or questions

1838
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,879
is

1839
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,800
how we continue working into the

1840
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,840
document to evolve that

1841
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:06,080
into or getting into the final shape

1842
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:09,760
before working group uh last call

1843
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:10,800
so for that uh we i we have already

1844
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,040
started some

1845
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:17,600
informal discussion with the uh

1846
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,880
current authors of uh architecture

1847
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,320
document

1848
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:26,320
so that is not yet itf but

1849
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:27,759
when it itf uh document working group

1850
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:30,960
document so

1851
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:34,480
what do we need in the use cases

1852
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,560
to help then that document uh do its

1853
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,599
its job that's a key question that we

1854
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,840
have so

1855
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,920
what should we cover that maybe it's not

1856
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,840
properly covered on the cover at all yet

1857
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,199
in the use cases document so those are

1858
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,040
the questions

1859
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:48,400
that we would like to get feedback from

1860
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,600
from the working group

1861
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:52,400
uh to help us uh working into the next

1862
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,480
iteration

1863
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,320
in the next version and that's it from

1864
01:12:54,480 --> 01:13:00,718
from my side

1865
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:04,159
if rick well one of the things that

1866
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:07,440
um we had discussed amongst ourselves

1867
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:10,639
as chairs co-chairs was that um

1868
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:14,080
so it does have a good collection of uh

1869
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:17,440
use cases there and that to

1870
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:20,880
help it wend its way towards last call

1871
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:24,400
probably we need to reach out to others

1872
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,440
in those areas um

1873
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,320
just to look at them for you know kind

1874
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,599
of answer your

1875
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:32,239
your question about are they

1876
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,560
representative and relevant are they

1877
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:36,159
um not so much is there a use case

1878
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,719
missing but are the ones that you have

1879
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:41,120
there

1880
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:44,080
um you know captured uh well enough

1881
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,400
um so that that was one thought um from

1882
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,679
a

1883
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,320
review standpoint okay that's a good

1884
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,360
point so

1885
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:55,519
i'll try to uh contact people

1886
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:58,159
from from each of the use case scenarios

1887
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,280
they were or people were involved for

1888
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,960
sure at the

1889
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,480
when we were doing it for example the

1890
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,640
last one that we added

1891
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,480
the text was suggested by one guy that

1892
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:09,760
was working on on the topic

1893
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:11,040
but i will reach out to people on each

1894
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,520
of the use cases

1895
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,239
and ask for feedback i will do that yes

1896
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,239
so

1897
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:18,080
carlos i will i will extend your

1898
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,360
previous comment which is this is a

1899
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,880
working group document

1900
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:25,679
so uh working group please reach out

1901
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,239
to any subject matter experts you might

1902
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:30,080
know

1903
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:31,280
um so if you work with someone who knows

1904
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,719
a lot about

1905
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:35,360
uh gaming at an internet scale could you

1906
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,480
ask them

1907
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,480
to look at the use cases on internet

1908
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:43,360
gaming

1909
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,959
same applies to uh obviously i can reach

1910
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,239
out to some smes on

1911
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,000
uav swarming but you know can you just

1912
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:51,440
have a look at this document review it

1913
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,880
and and if you

1914
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,879
think you know someone or or are a

1915
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,080
subject matter expert on some of these

1916
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:00,560
please

1917
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,360
have a have a good look from my

1918
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,480
perspective

1919
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:07,679
we don't need a huge

1920
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,360
drill down for every use case becoming

1921
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,840
you know 100 page

1922
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:14,080
detailed essay about that use case we

1923
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,440
just need to ensure that we are

1924
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:21,760
capturing relevant things and

1925
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:25,040
our assumptions are correct rather than

1926
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:27,040
incorrect that's all um

1927
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,400
with my chair hat on i think this is

1928
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:31,679
this is a good document

1929
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,639
it's focused um let's just get the

1930
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,840
reviews in

1931
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,880
and make sure it's that everyone in the

1932
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:39,600
working group is happy

1933
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,640
is ready so thank you very much for your

1934
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,640
work on this carlos and

1935
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,760
and the rest of the author team just

1936
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,320
checking jabba because a couple of

1937
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,840
people

1938
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:49,840
uh so niels has offered to

1939
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,280
uh rework some of the aeronautical

1940
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,239
communications section

1941
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:56,000
in there uh alexandra petrescu has

1942
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,799
mentioned about the uav platooning use

1943
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,640
case

1944
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,400
one of the use cases is the drone show

1945
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,560
using thousands of simultaneous flying

1946
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,159
drones

1947
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,760
yeah but unfortunately these communicate

1948
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:07,040
only went on the ground do we know when

1949
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,080
these drones will communicate amongst

1950
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:10,320
them in flight

1951
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,280
okay so without disappearing down a big

1952
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,239
uav

1953
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,800
platooning uh discussion uh the

1954
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:17,599
aeronautical use cases are extremely

1955
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,880
varied

1956
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:24,000
from tiny devices flocking

1957
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,280
to uh commercial aircraft moving at

1958
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,679
continental scale

1959
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,880
to uh let's ignore the whole military

1960
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:32,560
environment

1961
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:36,080
um so yes we could write

1962
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:38,000
a huge use case just about uav

1963
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,760
just about one particular detail of uav

1964
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,760
swarming so

1965
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:43,040
i think from my perspective as long as

1966
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,480
we capture

1967
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,800
some of the general purpose text without

1968
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,159
spending a year working on this document

1969
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,280
we'll have would have done the right

1970
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:53,040
thing

1971
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,800
uh pascal is in the queue go ahead

1972
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:57,840
pascal

1973
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:01,040
yes i just wanted to to suggest maybe

1974
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:02,239
some we need a link between those use

1975
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,560
cases which

1976
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,919
we show or here is where it applies here

1977
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,159
is where it applies

1978
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,360
and the architecture where we have

1979
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,040
basically selected

1980
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,759
two uh problems that we are solving like

1981
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:17,600
the excess

1982
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,120
and then the the mesh um if if there was

1983
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,000
a way to kind of

1984
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,800
glue those two and and i saw i would see

1985
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,719
the

1986
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,280
the conclusion of the use case document

1987
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:30,560
as as you know trying to extract

1988
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:30,559
uh what's the common

1989
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,560
thing that we need to look at and and

1990
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,080
that would basically

1991
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,640
you know create that link with the

1992
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:41,840
architecture document

1993
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:44,480
i i completely agree pascal i think

1994
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,600
that also means a solid use cases

1995
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:49,199
document

1996
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,000
so um the architecture document could

1997
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:52,559
say

1998
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,760
referring to the use cases rfc whatever

1999
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,000
it ends up being

2000
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:57,840
section two and section three these are

2001
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,800
the use cases we will be addressing in

2002
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,600
this framework

2003
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,480
means we can recharge a raw in the

2004
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,960
future

2005
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,839
and address different use cases that are

2006
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,400
out of scope

2007
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:10,719
for what we're proposing now and the

2008
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,199
next generation of smart ietf

2009
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,560
contributors can can solve the suite of

2010
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,799
problems that we

2011
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,960
choose not to solve now i think that's

2012
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,760
the correct way to do it

2013
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,040
yes the use cases at some point you need

2014
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,159
to be turned into something more

2015
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,760
abstract and more

2016
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,639
generic than uh this plane so so for

2017
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:31,360
instance

2018
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,600
you know the need for for other two for

2019
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,480
multiple access is at the same time

2020
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,000
um and that that's the piece that i

2021
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,080
would like to see extracted like

2022
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,520
abstract it to a level where we can take

2023
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,519
it over on the other side

2024
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:44,719
now we have two cases two two

2025
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,040
abstractions that we use

2026
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,719
like the access and the mesh are there

2027
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,080
other abstractions in these documents

2028
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:51,440
that we are not capturing in the

2029
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,960
architecture and then we decide whether

2030
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,719
we do capture them or not

2031
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,480
and we do process them or not or like

2032
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,600
you said in the future i will do that

2033
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:01,280
but right now we just explain the cases

2034
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,080
but

2035
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:07,040
that's not really turned into this

2036
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:10,080
abstraction of a primary access

2037
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:12,000
i agree go ahead

2038
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,760
yeah yeah i agree with that basically

2039
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,840
this is what i want to

2040
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,880
to start turning the the requirement

2041
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,080
section at the end

2042
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,040
try to really use that uh abstraction

2043
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,800
language let's

2044
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:25,440
just call it that way to to be

2045
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,560
homogeneous and to make the link with

2046
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:31,759
the architecture so i agree with that

2047
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,960
so let me let us try to do a first

2048
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,520
iteration

2049
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:36,719
in towards that direction uh together

2050
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,280
with the other

2051
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,320
feedback that we can get in and

2052
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:42,400
including the document

2053
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,080
and then we can reach out to you guys

2054
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:46,400
and and

2055
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,120
get some comments from your site the

2056
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,239
architecture

2057
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:53,519
authors and and try to to see whether

2058
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:55,199
the next version uh start going into the

2059
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,880
direction that you pointed out i fully

2060
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:58,719
agree with that

2061
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,480
that's perfect and by the way i just

2062
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,760
published the document as i promised so

2063
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,280
it's available yes i saw

2064
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:08,560
we saw that thank you very much

2065
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:12,000
um uh given uh the time uh or

2066
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:16,840
i think we're done carlos yes thanks

2067
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:20,000
okay great uh i think next up is uh

2068
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:22,639
mills yes

2069
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,120
oh i must permit niels to use the screen

2070
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:25,120
there we go

2071
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,840
go ahead niels

2072
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,879
and you need to uh you need to turn on

2073
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,120
your mic

2074
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:47,120
as well perfect

2075
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,559
perfect okay let me hear you all right

2076
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:51,679
yeah so i have the same problem as

2077
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:55,360
pascal but uh i think

2078
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:58,400
uh i hope you can see it's okay for now

2079
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,120
um yeah so so welcome and thanks for

2080
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,879
joining for

2081
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,559
uh the little update about our aldex

2082
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,960
draft so since

2083
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,880
uh last ietf there were a couple of

2084
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,920
changes so the last time we presented

2085
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:11,920
um the version 04 of the pre-adopted

2086
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,080
draft and now we got it adopted and

2087
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,679
already sent five updates so we got a

2088
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:18,080
huge amount of

2089
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,719
feedback so thank you a lot for all the

2090
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:22,320
comments

2091
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:25,360
very valuable and um here's the

2092
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:29,280
note well i think we covered that

2093
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:32,239
um yeah so this is now where we're at um

2094
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:33,120
looks like that and here the uh changes

2095
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:35,040
that appeared

2096
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,040
so i said oh and you're definitely gonna

2097
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,480
have to yeah we can't read it which

2098
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:43,040
i guess is just as well okay that's not

2099
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,239
very very very small but don't worry

2100
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,360
just speak to it

2101
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,320
we'll figure it out that's a little bit

2102
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:51,440
crazy oh that was great yeah

2103
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:54,480
okay there we go perfect um yeah

2104
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:57,360
so the most important part is um

2105
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:58,159
here you can see all the changes so we

2106
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,199
added about

2107
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:02,080
10 pages to the document and we covered

2108
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:05,040
um

2109
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,239
mostly the required language so the

2110
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,600
requirement language

2111
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:11,599
um so we already changed all the ietfk

2112
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,440
keywords and then we extended the

2113
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,320
terminology because there

2114
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,320
is a huge amount of abbreviations and uh

2115
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,639
yeah terminology helps here

2116
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,799
then most important and because we got a

2117
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,719
very helpful comment was what are

2118
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,000
the requirements to aldex so what is the

2119
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,239
ecosystem

2120
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,600
in which aldex will have to be deployed

2121
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:30,959
uh how does it look like what are the

2122
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,040
characteristics

2123
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,159
of that ecosystem so their requirements

2124
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,120
uh to

2125
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:38,239
aldex um so ldx had to be developed with

2126
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,800
a certain

2127
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,678
mindset so to speak and we list them

2128
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,000
here

2129
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:47,600
then we went really deep about real

2130
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,880
reliability and availability and i'm

2131
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,920
going to cover this and

2132
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,239
talk as well and then lastly a security

2133
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:56,880
consideration so we had to rework the

2134
01:22:54,239 --> 01:23:00,159
entire security considerations page

2135
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,600
and um yeah added a ton of stuff here uh

2136
01:23:00,159 --> 01:23:04,559
because there were some some

2137
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,800
recent updates regarding to that and

2138
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:10,000
also because um

2139
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,800
we had to uh aside from um

2140
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,719
aeronautical sources uh we included some

2141
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,840
of the tables found and they do

2142
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:20,639
350a which tells about the requirements

2143
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,760
for cptlc communication or adsc

2144
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:23,920
communication

2145
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,880
so aeronautical based communication what

2146
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,400
are the requirements

2147
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:31,920
for there and since ldex

2148
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:35,280
will probably be used um to

2149
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:37,679
support these message formats

2150
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,840
we had to have a look in there and also

2151
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,960
add that to the draft so this is all

2152
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:44,159
what happened uh during the last months

2153
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,080
here and

2154
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,440
let's go a little bit deeper in each

2155
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,320
section

2156
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,280
um first chapter six requirements to

2157
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,080
ldex

2158
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,960
um yeah what is the application area in

2159
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:57,679
general

2160
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,120
well we want to have a data link um that

2161
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,080
can communicate

2162
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,400
information related to the flight safety

2163
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,600
and

2164
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:08,799
regularity meaning that

2165
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:10,080
whatever uh air traffic control message

2166
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,320
or

2167
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,600
traffic services or aeronautical

2168
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:16,880
operational control

2169
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:18,719
or any other data that's relevant here

2170
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,280
for flight safety and regularity that's

2171
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,920
been

2172
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,480
sent over the link has to be taken into

2173
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,320
account and there are some pretty severe

2174
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:28,000
requirements to that as you mentioned

2175
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,559
before uh message

2176
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,679
errors have to be taken care of so that

2177
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:37,199
you have a really high reliability

2178
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:41,600
and yeah requirements to aldex also uh

2179
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:41,599
the challenges are that because

2180
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,440
flying around the world is actually

2181
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,040
happening worldwide guess what

2182
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,280
and there's heavy regulation regarding

2183
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:51,519
to that and also spectrum scarcity

2184
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:54,559
because there is a regulated

2185
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,840
and dedicated spectrum um

2186
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,000
available for aeronautical

2187
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,560
communications

2188
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,320
for instance here in the l-band and the

2189
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,719
problem now is that we have a huge

2190
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,480
amount of legacy systems since the 30s

2191
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:11,040
or 1930s in that spectrum

2192
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,799
and and blocking opportunities for new

2193
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,920
systems to come in for instance here for

2194
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:18,000
aldex

2195
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:21,040
the uh well most challenging

2196
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,360
uh thing was to get the

2197
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,040
communication system into a band where

2198
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,759
the distance measuring equipment that's

2199
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,080
dme

2200
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,040
are still sending out radio beacons with

2201
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,800
the magnitude

2202
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,880
more power than aldex is able to

2203
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,600
communicate so you had to work

2204
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,400
in between of those bursts and that

2205
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:39,440
means

2206
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:41,759
that you have to be smart to actually

2207
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,719
get a little bit of spectrum there in

2208
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,840
order to send

2209
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,920
data and um yeah

2210
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,040
that's because data links here in this

2211
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,040
environment may only use

2212
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:54,320
aviation license spectrum and as i said

2213
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:57,360
before it's pretty scarce now

2214
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:00,080
also we have not enough bandwidth on

2215
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:02,799
terrestrial data links so if you

2216
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:05,920
remember back in 1978

2217
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,840
the first acre system was

2218
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,679
designed for aeronautical communications

2219
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:13,920
with the use case in mind

2220
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:15,840
that crews on aircraft had to

2221
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,600
tell them whether they were airborne or

2222
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,199
not so tell the ground because they were

2223
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,080
paid differently and for that system

2224
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:22,719
acres was

2225
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:24,880
originally invented covering 2.4

2226
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:27,679
kilobits of data

2227
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:29,840
in 90s there were video the vdl mode 2

2228
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:33,520
so the vhf data link mode 2

2229
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:36,880
was uh invented with 35k bits of data

2230
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:39,040
now aldex brings about 2.4 megabits to

2231
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:43,440
the table so if you think about this

2232
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:47,040
evolution uh we're getting there

2233
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:49,678
yeah um then because

2234
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:52,560
there's a ton of different non vr of

2235
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,199
specific data links obviously 4g 5g and

2236
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,040
and all

2237
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,960
that stuff but the problem is for

2238
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,880
instance 5g you can't really use 5g

2239
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,880
because um you have huge ranges to be

2240
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,840
covered and 5g is not designed for huge

2241
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,719
ranges

2242
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,440
4g you could use but the problem is that

2243
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,880
it's just

2244
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:09,519
designed with a different use case in

2245
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:12,320
mind so it's really not applicable here

2246
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,159
and also the security issues exist for

2247
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,559
those data links that way

2248
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:17,360
and then for atf it's probably most

2249
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,600
important

2250
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:21,199
to remember that the aeronautical ip

2251
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,600
internet works so there are plans to

2252
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:25,839
integrate ip here into the internet work

2253
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,440
and the internet should be separated

2254
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,800
completely so there shouldn't be an

2255
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,120
opportunity from

2256
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,159
the internet actually to access than the

2257
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,599
avionic specific

2258
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:39,280
ip address range and simply

2259
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:41,120
put in some messages there then secondly

2260
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:42,400
objective of aldex as we said we wanted

2261
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,199
to replace

2262
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:47,440
legacy using proprietary acres as i

2263
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:49,519
mentioned before this acres technology

2264
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,360
with industry standard ip technology and

2265
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,520
provide a next generation terrestrial

2266
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,519
data link designed to support ip

2267
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,080
and provides a much higher bandwidth as

2268
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,320
i said before

2269
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:03,040
as of now there's one other data link

2270
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:06,080
for uh terminal maneuving areas and

2271
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,440
for airports that is already in use uh

2272
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,440
that's aeromax

2273
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,040
and aldex is then designed for

2274
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:13,360
continental on route

2275
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:14,639
uh traffic so appliance actually cruise

2276
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,559
of a continent

2277
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,800
and this is now or where we want to

2278
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:20,159
place zelda x and then the requirements

2279
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,800
for aldex is

2280
01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:23,519
um this terrestrial high throughput data

2281
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,960
link

2282
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:29,280
and the interoperability because

2283
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,280
uh first of all the different new

2284
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:33,360
systems that are coming into this

2285
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,320
um ecosystem such as aeromax as i

2286
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:37,280
mentioned before or

2287
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,239
satellite data links or ldx um they have

2288
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,199
to

2289
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:42,559
work as a multi-link technology and the

2290
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:45,440
other interoperability

2291
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,600
is um this ground network has to be uh

2292
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:51,199
connected obviously with the data

2293
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:54,560
link um to to the plane all right

2294
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:55,199
um about reliability and availability so

2295
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,199
that's chip

2296
01:28:55,199 --> 01:29:00,879
eight now um as the development of ldac

2297
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:04,239
started a couple of years ago

2298
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:07,679
um most of this stuff is not

2299
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:08,559
something new but it's very important to

2300
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,120
remember because

2301
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,159
it tells about a very robust system

2302
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,719
design

2303
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:16,799
so first we have um ofdm based frequency

2304
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,040
division duplex system

2305
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,880
and it's deployed in this aeronautical

2306
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:23,280
communications restricted l band

2307
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,000
and we only have 500 kilohertz bandwidth

2308
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,519
and this is also

2309
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,560
why we only have this uh 2.4 uh megabits

2310
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:32,400
top because um if you only have 500

2311
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,360
kilohertz as pretty little you can do i

2312
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,799
mean if you have

2313
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:38,000
lte 20 megahertz channels assigned

2314
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,320
obviously the data rate could

2315
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,719
go way higher but the problem is really

2316
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:45,199
the the spectrum scarcity here

2317
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,560
then another thing the the guard times

2318
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:50,080
are said to be able to

2319
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:52,239
operate in a 200 nautical while range

2320
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,280
forward link physical layer continuous

2321
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,959
so that means

2322
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:56,480
if if the ground station sends to an

2323
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,960
aircraft um

2324
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,879
then this ground station can send at any

2325
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,360
time but if an aircraft actually wants

2326
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:06,480
to respond it has to request resources

2327
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:09,040
in bursts and send data into bursts

2328
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,879
and then the user data uses adaptive

2329
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:13,199
coding and modulation so

2330
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,560
depending on the channel characteristics

2331
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,960
and the quality

2332
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,120
more data can be sent but control data

2333
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,280
is usually transmitting the most robust

2334
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:23,360
coding modulation

2335
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,960
then the neck layers on the right hand

2336
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:27,360
side you see the frame structure

2337
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:28,480
what we see here is a very fixed frame

2338
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:30,719
structure so we have

2339
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,000
super frames of 240 milliseconds

2340
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,600
magnitude

2341
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,679
we have a broadcast channel at the

2342
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:38,080
beginning of each forward link so that

2343
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:40,000
ground stations can exist can announce

2344
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:41,600
their existence into the world

2345
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,760
and we have a random access channel in

2346
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,360
the reverse link where aircraft can

2347
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,679
request to join a cell

2348
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,480
and in between we have multi-frames and

2349
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:50,000
at the

2350
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,519
bottom of the page you can see the

2351
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,719
multi-frame uh

2352
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,040
um is split into data

2353
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,960
frames so that's the data channel dch

2354
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:00,960
and into two different control channels

2355
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:04,080
where resources can be requested and

2356
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:07,600
allocated um and with this uh

2357
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:10,000
static frame structure design

2358
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,199
it's a very very robust uh design

2359
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,040
because you know when

2360
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:14,638
each pilot symbol will have to appear

2361
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:15,519
you know the time synchronization rather

2362
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,719
well

2363
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:20,560
and it's also important to remember that

2364
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,480
the entire resource management is

2365
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,480
handled by the ground station so even if

2366
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:25,599
an ldxl is full too many aircraft in a

2367
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,120
cell or something

2368
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,960
it can request a handover so the

2369
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:34,719
resource scheduling and management is

2370
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,719
entirely handled by the ground station

2371
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,920
moving on we have the data link layer we

2372
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:40,000
have an rq

2373
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,199
protocol for reliable data transmission

2374
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,080
layer 2

2375
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:45,839
with a selective repeat rq with

2376
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:48,239
transparent fragmentation reassembly to

2377
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,320
the resource allocation size

2378
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:53,519
with that we can achieve low latency and

2379
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:55,280
low overhead without losing reliability

2380
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,960
we also ensure the correct order of

2381
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,519
packet delivery

2382
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:00,639
we exclude duplicates uh we can identify

2383
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,880
lost fragments and then

2384
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,639
um with and that's important

2385
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,600
deterministic timers into the medium

2386
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:07,840
access frame

2387
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,760
and then uh initiate retransmission thus

2388
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,880
we get fixed times um

2389
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:16,239
of uh when we could expect

2390
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,719
a retransmission to be done successfully

2391
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:20,879
and we have a priority mechanism within

2392
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,520
aldex that ensures that most important

2393
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,840
message

2394
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:28,159
arrive timely before lower important

2395
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:29,760
message yeah now moving on to the

2396
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:31,199
security considerations

2397
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:33,120
i should have requested 20 minutes

2398
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:36,080
because it's a lot of updates

2399
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:39,120
um so the problem here is as i mentioned

2400
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:40,960
before akers was designed in 1978

2401
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:42,239
and since then a lot have uh has

2402
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,800
happened

2403
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:46,718
um and for instance now we have software

2404
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:47,600
defined radios this year there was a

2405
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:51,199
defcon the

2406
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:54,320
aerospace village where with a 300

2407
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:57,599
device it was shown how to

2408
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:59,199
do dubious stuff and um so this changed

2409
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,239
that landscape

2410
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:03,120
is becoming more important because as i

2411
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:05,280
said before

2412
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,120
there are open stack implementations of

2413
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,800
stuff uh on on github

2414
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,559
we have software defined radius nowadays

2415
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:11,920
so if you want to attack communication

2416
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,480
for an aircraft it's

2417
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:16,320
nowadays it's relatively easy and so we

2418
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:19,839
have to take security

2419
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:21,440
very very seriously and um we have to

2420
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,400
embed security features

2421
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:25,519
within nail decks already and we have to

2422
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,159
think about

2423
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:30,560
that we don't have too much bandwidth so

2424
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:34,638
whatever we do we shouldn't just uh

2425
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:37,760
basically fill the entire communication

2426
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:40,080
band with with security data

2427
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,920
and um then we have another thing going

2428
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,760
on and that's basically

2429
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,360
that the human as a control instance is

2430
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,080
going to be taken out gradually out of

2431
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:49,839
the loop

2432
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:52,960
so meaning we have fully automatic

2433
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,880
flights we have drones landing

2434
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,960
automatically and so on we have 4d

2435
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,719
trajectories so virtual points in the

2436
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,440
air that an aircraft can follow and so

2437
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,080
on

2438
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,360
and all these things have to be at least

2439
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:07,360
integrity protected

2440
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:08,159
so that nobody can inject messages and

2441
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:11,199
so on so

2442
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:13,120
strong cyber cyber security measures are

2443
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:14,879
a must for aldex to become

2444
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:16,639
adopted by the international civil

2445
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:19,679
aviation organization

2446
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:23,120
so here's uh is the listing of

2447
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:24,800
lx security considerations so uh

2448
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:26,320
it shall protect availability and

2449
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:28,400
continuity of service

2450
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,480
it shall protect the integrity and

2451
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,480
authenticity of messages in transit

2452
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:34,159
it should provide confidentiality of

2453
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:35,599
messages and transit it's important to

2454
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:37,280
note that there's a should because we

2455
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:39,600
have different messages

2456
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:42,239
on the link and depending on whether

2457
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,719
it's privacy relevant or not

2458
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:46,799
we need confidential confidentiality or

2459
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:49,119
sometimes it can even be a problem

2460
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,400
if that message has to appear for

2461
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:52,880
instance for all

2462
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,599
pilots in the vicinity um and everybody

2463
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:56,000
has to be

2464
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,719
able to read it then it's only it should

2465
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,159
then

2466
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,920
should provide non-repudiation for

2467
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:03,519
necessary messages in transit

2468
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:05,360
so if there's something that

2469
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,560
is very important and you shouldn't be

2470
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:09,040
able to

2471
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,639
repudiate from it then you need it

2472
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:12,239
obviously we have to have mutual

2473
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:14,480
authentication

2474
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:16,718
of communication entities uh authorize

2475
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,080
the permitted actions of users and deny

2476
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,880
actions else

2477
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,880
and uh we have to have in the capability

2478
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,520
to prevent the propagation of intrusion

2479
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,560
so

2480
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,679
if one ldx link from one ground station

2481
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,199
to an aircraft

2482
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:31,040
has some problems it shouldn't spread

2483
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:34,080
from that

2484
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:37,519
and yeah with that we

2485
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:39,840
um gave a very detailed i think a very

2486
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,280
detailed overview of the architectural

2487
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:44,719
details in section 10

2488
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:46,880
5 and told about the aldex

2489
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:49,360
entities for the security mode and we

2490
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:53,520
talked about trust

2491
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:56,880
about pkis in in that environment

2492
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:59,119
about entity identification about

2493
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,920
authentication key negotiation

2494
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,639
and then the message and transit

2495
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,960
confidentiality integrity and

2496
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:07,840
authenticity

2497
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,199
then we moved on to how this would

2498
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:12,560
actually be deployed

2499
01:36:09,199 --> 01:36:13,040
and how different algorithms come into

2500
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:16,159
play

2501
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,840
and protocols and yeah we started again

2502
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,559
with the trust ejection so we talked

2503
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,800
about for instance the arrow max pki

2504
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:24,239
because there is currently the plant as

2505
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,719
i said before to integrate different

2506
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:29,759
aeronautical communications technology

2507
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:33,199
um and the security behind them

2508
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:34,239
into into one system then we have the

2509
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,759
identity

2510
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:37,519
management based on the aircraft

2511
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,639
identities the problem is

2512
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,600
each aircraft has an as a relatively

2513
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,159
unique

2514
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,840
iko address but the problem is this 24

2515
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:47,599
bit addresses have been

2516
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,280
cloned before already so how do you

2517
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,159
actually identify

2518
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:54,000
an aircraft then certificates stored in

2519
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:55,759
the entities allowing

2520
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,360
then mutual authentication key exchange

2521
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,040
procedures and then we need to have a

2522
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,719
key derivation mechanism for perfect

2523
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:02,880
forward secrecy

2524
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,639
that's probably more also based on the

2525
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,360
key exchange procedure

2526
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:08,159
for instance using duffy helmet here and

2527
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,159
we have to

2528
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:12,559
protect user and control plane message

2529
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:14,960
and trend and transit integrity

2530
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:16,960
uh and confidentiality most important

2531
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,719
actually is the control message because

2532
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:20,480
if resource allocations don't happen

2533
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:22,960
anymore somebody has

2534
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,839
successfully broken the system so we

2535
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,560
have to

2536
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:28,960
be very careful in how to protect the

2537
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,520
control message part here

2538
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,639
yeah and those were the major updates so

2539
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:36,400
thanks for my side

2540
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:39,520
are there any questions uh shoot

2541
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:40,000
so uh rick here just jumping in quickly

2542
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,040
because

2543
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,840
i the question has come up before

2544
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:48,239
on why uh why are we handling this in

2545
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:51,360
raw uh

2546
01:37:48,239 --> 01:37:53,199
or the ietf so the critical thing is

2547
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,799
actually on this slide

2548
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:59,119
it's the uh ldx is a

2549
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,320
by the sound of it i'm not an rf expert

2550
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:03,040
a a

2551
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,040
sensible proposal to keep aircraft

2552
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:06,719
aircraft with the tower communications

2553
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:08,639
working successfully

2554
01:38:06,719 --> 01:38:10,960
the important thing i think that niels

2555
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:13,600
mentioned is at a certain point

2556
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,600
these ip packets may not flow to the

2557
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,000
internet but will be flowing to the

2558
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:18,159
ground

2559
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,280
segment and to other command control

2560
01:38:18,159 --> 01:38:22,400
systems

2561
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:24,880
existing on the ground using

2562
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:26,879
alternate technologies but the

2563
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:30,080
reliability and the determinism

2564
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:33,280
of that complete end-to-end path is

2565
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:37,600
important so although

2566
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:40,719
ldx the layer 1 layer 2 protocol may be

2567
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:43,280
slightly out of scope for the itf the

2568
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:44,080
interaction between ldax and the ground

2569
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:48,559
segment

2570
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:51,840
or alternate flying radio systems

2571
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,920
i think is directly in scope for for raw

2572
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:57,280
but i'm interested in another's opinion

2573
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,280
pascal go ahead you're in the queue

2574
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,800
i really love this picture and thank you

2575
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,960
niels

2576
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,840
for this great presentation uh i was

2577
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,920
just wondering

2578
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:07,360
do we have a case where for instance the

2579
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,920
plane on the top

2580
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:12,400
would use one or the two of the planes

2581
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:15,040
uh which are the lower level here

2582
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:17,119
to relate to the tower like like do we

2583
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,440
ever mesh them

2584
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:20,320
or is it not something you have thought

2585
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:23,599
to depley

2586
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,920
yet because raw would also give you that

2587
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,800
yeah um so i can answer that question

2588
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,159
real quick

2589
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:32,320
um what i presented now is the

2590
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:34,559
ldx air to ground communication link

2591
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:37,759
because it's much more mature but is

2592
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,040
also currently this effort going on in

2593
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:42,080
iko also

2594
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:44,560
at the german aerospace center to

2595
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:46,320
have the system details of an aldex

2596
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,880
air-to-air

2597
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,559
layer available and then yes something

2598
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,800
like an aircraft leaves

2599
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,639
the london airspace but wants to send a

2600
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,880
message to something and washing

2601
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:57,760
and then there's a huge mesh networks of

2602
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,400
aircraft

2603
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,440
relaying this message onto the final

2604
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,320
destination washing

2605
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:06,000
this is going to happen and uh so for

2606
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:08,320
that it just takes a couple of

2607
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,080
a little bit of time until the file

2608
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,719
layer and mac layer procedures are

2609
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:17,199
clearly defined

2610
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:18,800
can i add speaking personally

2611
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:21,280
that use case is obviously being

2612
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:25,679
explored by various aeronautical

2613
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:28,159
companies again

2614
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:29,440
not always happening at layer 2 so again

2615
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:32,638
that's the use case from

2616
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:34,559
for raw so you may get the aircraft to

2617
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:36,080
aircraft handover happening at the ip

2618
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:39,679
layer rather than

2619
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:41,840
at the link layer

2620
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:43,600
for simple reasons that the aircraft may

2621
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,239
be carrying different manufacturers

2622
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,239
radios

2623
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:51,840
a number of different security domains

2624
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,840
etc

2625
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,840
anyone else

2626
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:13,119
speaking to myself you are speaking to

2627
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:15,919
yourself

2628
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:16,400
um yeah i had muted myself um but thank

2629
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:18,719
you

2630
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,638
and thank you for uh and the co-author

2631
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:24,000
for iterating after

2632
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:27,679
um the good feedback that you received

2633
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:32,239
um so we look forward to the next draft

2634
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:35,119
um and we can and continuing to iterate

2635
01:41:32,239 --> 01:41:36,879
we have one more presentation uh and i

2636
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:37,599
think because we've had so much good

2637
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:41,760
discussion

2638
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,560
um fabrice uh the floor is yours and you

2639
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:46,320
have

2640
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,320
you know we we're coming up on the hour

2641
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:49,920
so but you have your 15 minutes and

2642
01:41:48,960 --> 01:42:01,840
maybe a little

2643
01:41:49,920 --> 01:42:01,840
wiggle room beyond that

2644
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,119
um

2645
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:12,719
[Music]

2646
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:16,400
your audio and mute

2647
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:16,400
yeah perfectly yeah there we go

2648
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:20,320
okay let's start uh i will try to keep

2649
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:22,719
it short uh

2650
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:24,320
because we are short in time well no you

2651
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:27,280
have your 15 minutes

2652
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:28,639
um so it's all there enough time for the

2653
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,960
discussion after that so

2654
01:42:28,639 --> 01:42:31,920
yes after the plantation i would just

2655
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,199
try to

2656
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:37,920
present what we updated in the draft so

2657
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:39,040
basically as a remainder uh the version

2658
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,159
was

2659
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:44,400
going all the aspects of oem wireless

2660
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:46,559
and determinist networks and we have

2661
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:49,199
decided to split the document

2662
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:52,000
in the date net version server so that's

2663
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:54,879
everything which is generic for that net

2664
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,360
cases and in the version 3 we try to

2665
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,159
focus

2666
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,040
only on the specific widow networks and

2667
01:42:58,159 --> 01:43:02,719
now we

2668
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:04,080
moved hopefully all the generic aspects

2669
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,040
to the date net version

2670
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:09,519
and now this our version is focused

2671
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:11,519
uniquely on wireless networks

2672
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,880
so i i will present shortly what we have

2673
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,960
done up to now

2674
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,040
uh we've introduced the terminology

2675
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:20,159
section trying to detach

2676
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:22,480
or what is expect which where

2677
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:24,480
but who i am maintenance set point

2678
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:26,000
active passive hybrid measurements

2679
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:29,280
controlling the data plane

2680
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:32,800
so all what is generic enough to be

2681
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,519
put in the paper craft and here we

2682
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,080
focused on

2683
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:38,080
the control techniques that are used in

2684
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,199
war for wires so for instance for biggie

2685
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,280
biking because

2686
01:43:39,199 --> 01:43:42,400
we have a very high medium access cost

2687
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:45,199
so we piggyback

2688
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:45,679
some control information normal packets

2689
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:48,638
about

2690
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:50,480
inbound and half toughbone monitoring so

2691
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:52,159
without and

2692
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:53,839
in the control plane but with the

2693
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:56,559
databases on that

2694
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,239
what are the messenger and the defect

2695
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:02,159
and the difference with force

2696
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:04,559
uh temporary versus permanent faults

2697
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:07,519
um for one network it has not changed a

2698
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,320
lot for the sections which is specific

2699
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,639
to uh

2700
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,920
defining what why why networks are

2701
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,080
specific so

2702
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,520
that's the concept of a link abstraction

2703
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,000
that doesn't hold

2704
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:19,520
anymore in wireless network because we

2705
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:22,000
have link asymmetry

2706
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,600
because we have some different

2707
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,440
characteristics and external

2708
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,840
interference

2709
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,440
we define also that broadcast

2710
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:33,760
transmissions have an impact

2711
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:36,960
on the rom plane because we may use some

2712
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:40,080
other packets to infer something and

2713
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,119
we also have a deep change in the

2714
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:44,159
forwarding process

2715
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:45,199
since we may have complex layer 2 for

2716
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:49,440
running such as

2717
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:52,879
any cast or this kind of stuff

2718
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:54,320
for the operation part the objective of

2719
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:56,560
that is to keep the network

2720
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:58,159
up and running so we have a connective

2721
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:00,159
verification

2722
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:01,759
basically that's something which is

2723
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:04,159
quite common but we we have the

2724
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,239
specificity of any cast

2725
01:45:04,159 --> 01:45:07,759
that makes that uh the number of

2726
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:11,360
possibilities is

2727
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,560
increasing very fast so we have

2728
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:15,199
different probabilities for each

2729
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,520
receiver so that's very complicated

2730
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:19,919
and actually when we take a look at the

2731
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,719
root tracing so the identifying the root

2732
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,760
that has been

2733
01:45:20,719 --> 01:45:25,360
used for a given packet that's is much

2734
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,560
more complicated because we have a major

2735
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,719
topology so we have

2736
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:29,679
multiple forwarders at each up to

2737
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:31,840
increase

2738
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:34,560
the availability and variability so

2739
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:37,520
that's much more complicated to

2740
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:39,119
trace all the possibilities and the

2741
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,040
force are very common in wireless

2742
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:44,799
because we have link quality

2743
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:46,480
variations we have obstacles so that

2744
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:49,199
means that it has to be monitored

2745
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:51,360
properly continuously

2746
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:52,960
for the administration we have to keep

2747
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:55,759
track of the resources

2748
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,960
and how they are used actually we have

2749
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,199
to define the

2750
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,679
matrix we have to collect so we have

2751
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:05,519
plenty of different metrics to

2752
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:07,679
collect to be able to at least estimate

2753
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,719
the quality of each link and of each

2754
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,840
track so

2755
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,560
such as the radio signal strength

2756
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,679
indicator

2757
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,760
the pacquiao washer the q length and it

2758
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:21,440
has to be monitored per radio channel

2759
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:24,560
per water per flow so we have very

2760
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:27,599
large viability here and so it has to be

2761
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:29,760
um android properly to

2762
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,199
limit the bandwidth consumption because

2763
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,000
else we have a huge

2764
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,320
amount of control traffic to transmit

2765
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,880
and

2766
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:37,840
sometimes the wireless networks have a

2767
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,360
low bitrate

2768
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:43,040
so it has to be considered properly to

2769
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,199
compress the volume of data for

2770
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:48,000
information that has to be sent

2771
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:48,799
so that it may be scalable and

2772
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,320
acceptable

2773
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:55,360
in this situation and

2774
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:58,159
last part we have also modified quite

2775
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:00,799
slightly is the maintenance part

2776
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:02,559
because we have to achieve predictive

2777
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,679
maintenance and reconfiguration in our

2778
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:07,520
network

2779
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:10,000
so typically to adapt them to

2780
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:10,880
reach the variability algorithm control

2781
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,560
plane

2782
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:14,719
is quite complicated because we have

2783
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:15,760
wireless networks wires links so some

2784
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:19,679
packets may be

2785
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:21,679
lost so we have to uh define a method a

2786
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,840
technique so that we can recover from

2787
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,840
this

2788
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,719
packet classes so either end to end

2789
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,360
up by all protest missions it has to be

2790
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,400
discussed

2791
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:37,119
properly and we have also to

2792
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,080
take care of a dynamic behavior of the

2793
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:40,159
network

2794
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,000
so because the network is changing

2795
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,519
continuously so we

2796
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:45,199
have some faults which are just

2797
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:47,199
transient and the network is well

2798
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:49,599
configured for this situation

2799
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:51,280
however for some long-term evolutions we

2800
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,360
have to work configure the network

2801
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:55,360
to be able to cop within the novel

2802
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:57,199
conditions so it has to be properly

2803
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:00,199
distinguished between

2804
01:47:57,199 --> 01:48:01,519
what requires a change of the network

2805
01:48:00,199 --> 01:48:04,159
configuration

2806
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,639
and what is a legal change because

2807
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:07,280
that's

2808
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,520
just a temporary variation of link

2809
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,960
quality for instance

2810
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:16,320
so the next step is what we achieved

2811
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:18,320
up to now do we have some missing points

2812
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:20,239
in our documents do we have some

2813
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,599
do you have some critics suggestions

2814
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:23,919
from a working job

2815
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,520
so we are very any suggestion

2816
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,920
contribution is welcome

2817
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:32,400
uh and um last but not least also

2818
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:34,080
should we have a working goal but option

2819
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:36,080
for this draft or not

2820
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,519
is it of interest for working group so

2821
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:41,360
that's the open question

2822
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:41,360
from myself and from the hotels

2823
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:48,480
thank you very much um so

2824
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:52,239
i'm just checking our charter a second

2825
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:56,400
because i think oam is a charter item

2826
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:59,919
so your working group uh adoption call

2827
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:02,159
is valid let me just i've got lost in

2828
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:05,840
the data tracker excuse me one moment

2829
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:07,119
um it is listed in the charter

2830
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,840
even though it's not listed in the

2831
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,839
milestones

2832
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:17,759
it is mentioned in the charter um

2833
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:21,519
so so my my question therefore is

2834
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:24,080
we need an oam document we have an oam

2835
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,199
individual draft therefore uh working

2836
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:28,159
group

2837
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:30,400
you need to review this um so authors

2838
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:33,360
are you are you asking for adoption

2839
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:34,960
or uh i mean do you think this is ready

2840
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,480
for adoption or are you looking for more

2841
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,719
feedback first

2842
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,919
no no i i don't we don't think that this

2843
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:42,639
is ready for adoption

2844
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:43,599
and carlos will join us as an author for

2845
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,760
this con for this

2846
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,440
draft so he will also contribute in the

2847
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:50,000
next tweaks so he has proposed to do

2848
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:52,239
that so but it's not ready but uh

2849
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,239
okay

2850
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,400
okay understood so um i might suggest

2851
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,400
working group have

2852
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,440
it's this document is available on the

2853
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:01,199
data tracker uh

2854
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:03,119
read it give the author's feedback

2855
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:05,040
because

2856
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:07,360
although they're not asking now i can

2857
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:09,119
imagine maybe after the next ietf they

2858
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:13,759
might be ready to ask for adoption

2859
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:13,759
so please help okay

2860
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:19,519
any other questions i think it's not a

2861
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:21,199
question just to comment on my part in

2862
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:23,840
addition to sort of

2863
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:25,598
rejiggering the milestones you know in

2864
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,040
much the same way we need to rejigger

2865
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:28,800
them to account for the fact that we

2866
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,719
don't have a separate requirement stock

2867
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:34,480
we've got a technology draft

2868
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:37,280
instead um the we probably need to

2869
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:39,280
uh also add a milestone around oam

2870
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:41,360
that's a little further out

2871
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:42,639
and we can definitely use your input for

2872
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:47,679
breeze about and

2873
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:47,679
authors about um sort of a time frame

2874
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:52,639
so uh just as a heads up for the for the

2875
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:55,679
working group uh even i

2876
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:58,080
are looking to just align the

2877
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,520
uh charter milestones with what we're

2878
01:50:58,080 --> 01:51:02,880
actually working on

2879
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,199
uh it's a bit of admin but of course we

2880
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:05,040
will

2881
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:06,480
inform the working group of what we're

2882
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:08,320
proposing before we actually make the

2883
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:11,280
decisions

2884
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:12,799
right and and it's also that it's um as

2885
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:15,920
i was saying to rick

2886
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:18,080
the oam um work is or

2887
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:19,599
the need for oam is mentioned in the

2888
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:22,080
charter even though it wasn't

2889
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:23,199
initially it's not in the initial set of

2890
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:26,159
milestones so

2891
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,719
we just need to align them and before

2892
01:51:26,159 --> 01:51:29,679
our ad

2893
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,599
jumps to the microphone and panics that

2894
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:32,560
we're completely changing the scope of

2895
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:34,320
the group

2896
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:35,840
we're not we're just trying to make sure

2897
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:38,400
that our milestones

2898
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:41,199
match our charter match our actual

2899
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:44,400
capabilities of delivering

2900
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:47,519
so um we

2901
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:50,559
have look at that we have nine minutes

2902
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:52,000
exactly for open mic it's almost as

2903
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,760
though we planned it if

2904
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,400
if no one has any further questions for

2905
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,840
fabrics uh

2906
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,759
thank you very much to all our

2907
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,679
presenters and

2908
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:06,880
um yeah the queue is open for

2909
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:06,880
for general discussion

2910
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:17,840
oh georgios appeared and then

2911
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,840
disappeared

2912
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:28,400
uh yeah the q feature is is is is fine

2913
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,239
otherwise i shall sit quietly and drink

2914
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:34,480
my coffee because we have

2915
01:52:30,239 --> 01:52:34,480
we have meat echo for another 10 minutes

2916
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:45,759
go ahead hello

2917
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:46,960
um yes if we have a minute or two i

2918
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:49,760
would like to come back to the

2919
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,719
uh architecture and uh the plan to

2920
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,199
proceed so

2921
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:54,719
we we kind of gave ourselves like four

2922
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:58,559
weeks

2923
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:59,520
um i just published 05 as i as i said i

2924
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,480
would

2925
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,960
and uh what i would love to see happen

2926
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:07,119
now

2927
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:10,480
is uh share the github with lou and rick

2928
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:12,400
uh invite you on the github and uh start

2929
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:14,638
working on the

2930
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:16,400
on the changes that that both of you

2931
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,480
have suggested

2932
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,839
and and for that since we have a very

2933
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:23,678
very tight

2934
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:26,400
time um i guess we would need to

2935
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:28,159
to have a few sessions between authors

2936
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,480
to to agree on what gets in

2937
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:32,400
and and then we would notify the group

2938
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,879
that were already basically

2939
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,759
well the reason i said four weeks is

2940
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,080
because

2941
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,880
i have learned from experience that when

2942
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:41,360
chairs say

2943
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,480
we will ask in 12 weeks then it gets

2944
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:45,119
forgotten

2945
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:45,919
so uh if you if you think four weeks is

2946
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:48,159
too soon

2947
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:49,440
that's fine we can we can leave it for

2948
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:55,360
longer

2949
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:58,559
no no actually it's too late

2950
01:53:55,360 --> 01:54:01,199
you know if you ask me if you ask me uh

2951
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,159
what we would do is uh adopt the damn

2952
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:04,719
thing

2953
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,920
uh and as part of the adoption procedure

2954
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:09,199
you chairs would

2955
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:12,960
ask me to invite the two new authors

2956
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:13,919
so when i publish uh zero zero the only

2957
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:16,239
change would be

2958
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,599
adding others so changing reshuffling

2959
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:22,159
the authors

2960
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:23,199
and from there we would form a kind of

2961
01:54:22,159 --> 01:54:25,440
design team

2962
01:54:23,199 --> 01:54:26,799
or just the authors but it could be a

2963
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:28,000
design team which would be wider than

2964
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,960
that i don't know

2965
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,840
to actually do what lou and rick have

2966
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,400
asked

2967
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:36,000
now since it's flow and risk riku know

2968
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:39,119
what they want uh it could also

2969
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,560
be done um just between the authors uh

2970
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:43,360
copying the mailing list on what

2971
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,920
progress is but uh i i don't see a good

2972
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:46,239
reason

2973
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:47,199
if we know you know if if we know where

2974
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:49,598
we're going

2975
01:54:47,199 --> 01:54:51,519
to wait for four weeks i mean but the

2976
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:53,760
work happens as a work document

2977
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:55,679
okay so so so my suggestion for the four

2978
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:59,840
weeks was not about

2979
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:03,040
um rate of work or additional authors

2980
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:05,520
it was simply because

2981
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:07,360
you uh because the current draft wasn't

2982
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:10,159
available until this morning

2983
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,920
or today um there had been no

2984
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:13,519
opportunity for the working group to

2985
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:16,400
read the latest version

2986
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,880
before making a decision on adoption so

2987
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:22,159
the four weeks was purely so

2988
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:24,080
the working group um participants get a

2989
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:26,790
chance to read

2990
01:55:24,080 --> 01:55:28,080
the draft you have just published and

2991
01:55:26,790 --> 01:55:30,000
[Music]

2992
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:32,159
consider whether this is the correct

2993
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,639
direction for uh

2994
01:55:32,159 --> 01:55:35,759
the architecture and framework for for

2995
01:55:34,639 --> 01:55:37,199
raw

2996
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:38,560
yeah but but that's that's exactly what

2997
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:40,320
the call for adoption is right you're

2998
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,639
not saying we adopted today

2999
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:43,519
but if you're saying hey uh we give you

3000
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:46,639
in four weeks

3001
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,920
it's just like even too much if if

3002
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,599
the considering the tight in the

3003
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,239
schedule we have and and the fact that

3004
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:52,000
you and

3005
01:55:50,239 --> 01:55:54,159
lou identified some more work that needs

3006
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,840
to be done um

3007
01:55:54,159 --> 01:55:57,519
so we could do it in the personal

3008
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:00,159
submission but i mean

3009
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,159
why not do it

3010
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:03,920
i'm trying to split the two and i see

3011
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,719
you're in the queue lou

3012
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,679
um i'm trying to split the two questions

3013
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:08,960
between

3014
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,960
does the working group adopt the

3015
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:13,599
document and

3016
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:15,280
is there more work to do on the document

3017
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:18,159
i think they're two different questions

3018
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:19,119
and can be addressed in parallel my

3019
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:22,879
question is

3020
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:25,759
to the working group is is this document

3021
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:27,679
that the correct document to be adopted

3022
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,760
by the working group

3023
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:32,000
is this the raw architecture and frame

3024
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:33,760
is this the document we want to start

3025
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:39,280
the raw architecture and framework

3026
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:43,840
work with and the reason is

3027
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:43,840
okay well we can uh

3028
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:51,599
you know there's a reason we like have

3029
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:52,719
two week cutoffs you're you just

3030
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:54,159
published it today

3031
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:56,480
it's in the middle it's just the start

3032
01:56:54,159 --> 01:56:57,839
of the ietf week it's

3033
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,919
even though we're virtual it's still a

3034
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:00,880
busy week i don't think it's reasonable

3035
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,800
this you know to say

3036
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:04,159
i published it five minutes ago can we

3037
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,320
adopt it

3038
01:57:04,159 --> 01:57:07,440
let's get and the four weeks is sort of

3039
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,920
reasonable given

3040
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,799
you know a week for the ietf to take

3041
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:12,400
place

3042
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,320
uh next week i know there's a whole

3043
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:15,839
bunch of people you know i know we're

3044
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,880
not traveling but maybe we're taking

3045
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:18,560
some vacation

3046
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,280
time next week it's a popular type of

3047
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:23,760
that so you know real work happening in

3048
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,880
in after that is he seemed sort of

3049
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,560
reasonable to me and i figured that's

3050
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,360
part of the for the the four-week

3051
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,520
comment

3052
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:32,480
i don't think we'll say i published it

3053
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:35,440
today can we adopt it today

3054
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:36,799
my my reason for thinking four weeks was

3055
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:39,280
it runs us up to the start of the

3056
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:42,320
christmas break it's make a decision

3057
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:45,360
this working year you know

3058
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:45,360
i and i agree lou

3059
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:50,839
i mean i'm very happy to do a show of

3060
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:54,639
hands

3061
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:56,159
now but it won't be binding because

3062
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:58,960
people need a chance to consider these

3063
01:57:56,159 --> 01:58:02,080
things right but be clear i never said

3064
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,679
we adopted today right i said

3065
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:05,040
we we just discuss it on the mailing

3066
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:05,760
list that's what the call for adoption

3067
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:07,519
years

3068
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:09,280
uh and we take the time it needs right

3069
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,960
and if you say it's four weeks it's

3070
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:13,199
right now yes i'm anxious that it's too

3071
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:15,199
close to christmas

3072
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:17,519
i i'm just making the cut off before

3073
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:18,239
christmas i i imagine most people will

3074
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,760
make that

3075
01:58:18,239 --> 01:58:25,360
mind up fed uh sooner but

3076
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:28,080
if i say three weeks then it's you know

3077
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:28,799
eve what's your thought oh i was just

3078
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:30,800
gonna say

3079
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,880
i was kind of going to agree with what

3080
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:35,280
pascal just said which is

3081
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:37,360
okay it's been posted people please read

3082
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:39,840
it let's aim for getting

3083
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:41,759
comments in you know obviously it's

3084
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:44,080
going to be hard to do that this week

3085
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:44,880
so and it made me hard to do it for

3086
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,480
people in the us

3087
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,000
next week because of the thanksgiving

3088
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,040
holiday uh

3089
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,880
and um but i do think that sometime

3090
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:55,199
before the end of the year before

3091
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:56,320
the uh christmas holiday the december

3092
01:58:55,199 --> 01:58:59,040
holidays

3093
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:00,639
uh is perfectly reasonable and if people

3094
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:04,000
can do it sooner great

3095
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:06,480
so uh let's take it to the list uh

3096
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,159
and and set our expectations for some

3097
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:11,119
time in early december

3098
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:12,000
and if it has to be mid-december great

3099
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:13,759
as long as it's

3100
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,239
we we aim for this year it will be

3101
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:16,239
terrific

3102
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:24,239
that people will take it seriously if

3103
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:25,599
you make it like please review you know

3104
01:59:24,239 --> 01:59:27,040
it's going to be a whale i may do that

3105
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:29,040
if i find the time

3106
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:30,480
no no no no no sorry it's going to be a

3107
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:32,320
call for adoption

3108
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:34,239
before the end of the year sort of mid

3109
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,960
mid december is my proposal

3110
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:39,119
so please review read now the call for

3111
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,520
adoption will be this year

3112
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:43,679
and and actually i'll go one step

3113
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:44,000
further pascal which is to say that when

3114
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,159
we

3115
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:47,840
issue our minutes to remind people about

3116
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:48,559
the reviews that are needed because we

3117
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:50,800
have

3118
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,400
a couple of these documents that are

3119
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:56,840
waiting for adoption

3120
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:59,199
so um that'll will tie those things

3121
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:04,000
together

3122
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:04,000
