this is a formal ietf meeting which our

means our notewell applies and

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,240
everything we say and do here is

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,240
governed by our process

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,960
and become part of our permanent record

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,560

42
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,158
of that record

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
and again please help with the minute

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,960
taking

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,320
as always seems to happen we end up with

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
a very packed agenda

47
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
uh no matter how much time we request we

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119
always seem to fill it

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
uh which is great that's nice to have an

50
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,840
active working group

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,840
um this the only thing that's changed

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
since originally published as we

53
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,200
reordered things a little bit

54
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,238
um so if you happen to look at the

55
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,440
the first version of the agenda you

56
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,640
may find yourself moved around in

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,040
time and in order we

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,519
there was a minor tweaking on time just

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,400
to fit all the requests

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
we do give preference of course to

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,879
working group drafts and other

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,200
chartered activities

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,560
we will continue to be working this way

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,480
for a while as everyone has seen itf 109

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,120
is um sorry this is

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,518
updated a bunch of different slides

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,120
ietf110

68
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,280
um is going to be online

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
so our next one is online uh we're

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
online now

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,440
we'll continue working this way for a

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,720
while

73
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
please use the list and we have the

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,959
online webex available

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,239
for both informal meetings and uh

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,000
formal interims all it takes is

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
to get one of those is to make a request

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,680
to the chairs and we will set you up

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
with it for interims um you can also

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,120
request an interim although we

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,080
we will initiate those as um

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,280
we think necessary as you saw sometimes

83
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
we initiate and they

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,599
they don't quite work out um as happened

85
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,840
with our last interim

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,720
but we we want to use these online

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,400
meetings between idf's to keep our

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,959
process going so that

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,480
even though we're not meeting in person

90
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
we keep the momentum going

91
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
our formal ipr process which we do polls

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
both that accept working group

93
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,640
acceptance

94
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,159
and as part of our last call

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,760
um hasn't changed um

96
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,679
and but i think and i think everyone is

97
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,399
familiar with it but it's always good to

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,400
show this to remind newcomers

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
we're going to work through walk through

100
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,638
the um

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
uh active drafts in a moment uh pavon

102
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040
will do that

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,080
um in terms of where we are from

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,280
the publication process we have one uh

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,919
new uh rfc this is actually

106
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
quite the bit of work um that was done

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,479
to get us here

108
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,960
and it's a um it's a

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,080
a significant foundational document in

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,719
in our yang work and this is about

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,919
um this allows us to represent te

112
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,440
topologies

113
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,840
in yang it's it took quite a while to

114
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,719
get

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,719
there and we really appreciate all who

116

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,159
and l3 and sr topology augments

173
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,800
are all nearing completion they've all

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,840
had a young doctor review done

175
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,199
we also have tom petch diligently

176
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,679
reviewing each of these

177
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919
thanks to him the authors have been

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,039
making sure that each of his comments

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
do get addressed uh there's also this

180
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,639
new expectation rather recommendation

181
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
from the young doctors

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,080
to add a json instance of the young

183
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,719
model

184
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,080
in the appendix uh of the draft in which

185
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,160
the model is proposed

186
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,240
so the plan for most of these documents

187
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
uh is to address the last set of

188
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,199
comments from tom

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
add the json instance to the appendix

190
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,120
and then request working with last call

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,319
so in the meantime it would be great if

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,520
you could get some more reviews and

193
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,319
feedback and on the usability of these

194
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
modules

195
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
there are a couple of young documents

196
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,560
that are listed here as

197
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,400
ready for young doctor review those are

198
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,599
the act and vn yang

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,159
and the path computation young documents

200
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,559
we initiated the review process for both

201
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,159
of these documents over the weekend

202
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,919
we also have three documents marked in

203
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,120
red here which are currently in expired

204
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
state

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,880
the authors have promised to revive

206
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,360
those uh this week

207
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,200
um so before we move on to the next

208
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,680
slide deck there are a couple of

209
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,839
uh topics that i would like to double

210
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,839
click on so let's jump to slide six

211
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,439
yeah so this is the smp raft uh there

212
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
are a couple of open items for which the

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
others are seeking some inputs

214
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,120
they did start a couple of threads for

215
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,079
this on the list adrian did chime in on

216
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
one of them

217
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,519
i would encourage others to participate

218
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,640
in those threats and

219
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
help the others close them

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
let's go to slide seven

221
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,399
this is the document that discusses pce

222
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,079
cc use cases

223
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,240
a few meetings back there was some

224
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,839
debate on whether

225
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
they should just remain as a living

226
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,200
document and not go through the

227
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,360
publication process

228
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
we decided then to revisit the status of

229
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,519
this document at a later point in time

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,440
we believe it is that time now the

231
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
authors have just requested to change

232
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,240
the state of this document to

233
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,920
adopt it for working group info only

234
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
we would like to get some opinions in on

235
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,479
this before we make the change we

236
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
understand there's been

237
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,320
a fair bit of work uh put in to get this

238
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
document to the stage

239
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
and uh don't uh really want to

240
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,440
discourage folks from making similar

241
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,839
contributions going forward

242
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
so if the authors or anybody who wants

243
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
to chime in with their thoughts

244
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
yeah it would be great

245
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,920
drew or any of the authors would you

246
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
like to say something

247
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,079
so i think based on the past comments we

248
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,000
we thought that because the isg itself

249
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,439
was not preferring too many use cases

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
documents basically when

251
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,320
the extension work was almost ready and

252
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,680
these documents have done their job of

253
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
like you know convincing the working

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,239
group and the itf that this

255
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,000
work is needed so that was the

256
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
understanding we were in but we would

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
respect whatever opinion that the chairs

258
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,000
and the ads suggest

259
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,959
and if there is a push to uh publish we

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
would of course

261
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,800
be more happy to publish it because we

262
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
have done the work but

263
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,920
we are following the guidance that has

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,560
given to us so we are completely open to

265
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
what

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,518
you throw our way okay

267
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,279
fair enough anybody else would like to

268
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,680
chime in

269
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
so lou and i would uh discuss this with

270
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,839
ada

271
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,399
and make a call on it we will share the

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,560
outcome of that discussion on the list

273
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,320
uh i will stop here with respect to this

274
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,000
tech i'll let you go through the rest of

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
the slides and also the reports that are

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
sent to the list in leisure

277
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
please do send out an email on the list

278
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,160
if you find anything missing

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
so any quick questions on the status of

280
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,199
any working route

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,800
any working group document before we

282
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,760
invite drew to present the star

283
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,760
the next presentation

284
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,439
i guess not through europe

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,000
i will be presenting an update to three

286
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,800
working group documents

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,839
they are all yang model related to ac tn

288
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,399
and vn

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,399
next slide

290
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,959
so we have uh nine uh yang models here

291
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
we have a vn yang model uh augmenting of

292
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
te

293
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,360
and vn for kpi telemetry and

294
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,639
a bunch of service mapping model where a

295
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,279
generic types model

296
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
and then augmentation of various service

297
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
models

298
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
and network model so let's go over an

299
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,880
update of

300
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,880
each of them uh next slide

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,359
and maybe one more you can

302
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,839
yes so this is a introduction to what vn

303
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,000
yang

304
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,959
is this is the young model for vn

305
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,240
operations

306
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,000
it is from the customer point of view we

307
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,040
uh use heavily the abstract topology and

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,720
uh and the connectivity matrix to

309
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:42,160
uh to represent the vn model and

310
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,160
it is it is a higher abstraction it is

311
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,439
from the customer's point of view

312
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,360
and this has been uh sort of like

313
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,839
getting ready for a while we are

314
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,519
as power earlier mentioned that we think

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,040
that we are young doctor review ready

316
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,720
but i will quickly go over

317
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,839
what are the recent set of changes that

318
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,560
we have made next slide

319
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,200
so if you guys uh remember uh in the

320
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,518
last

321
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,399
meeting we presented an uh and

322
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,120
suggestion

323
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
from kenichi ogaki from kddi where he

324
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,440
would want

325
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,120
wanted to make a change to the vm

326
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,240
compute we discussed that during the

327
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,480
last meeting

328
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,399
and that change has been incorporated in

329
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,440
the draft so the basically the change

330
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,279
allows the vn compute rpc to be a single

331
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,000
rpc that can be used

332
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,800
uh to make a single call to get the

333
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
result

334
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,920
or the vn result in one call as i

335
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:35,360
mentioned earlier since we were

336
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,079
dependent on t topology earlier this was

337
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,399
a two call so that they wanted to

338
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,719
simplify and the way to simplify was

339
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,839
pretty straightforward we optionally

340
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,000
included two

341
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
groupings in the vm compute these are

342
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
the te types grouping

343
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,920
for generic path constraints and t types

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,000
grouping for generic path optimization

345
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,240
by reusing these two groupings in vn

346
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,480
compute we are able to now

347
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,880
get the results and pass all the

348
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,240
information needed for vn computation

349
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,040
in one rpc call this has been done

350
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
at the vl level as well as at the vn

351
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,599
member level

352
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
so this is the main change that we have

353
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,639
done but uh

354
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,920
continuing there were some more comments

355
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,839
that's uh in the next slide

356
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,079
so those are our current uh pending work

357
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,360
uh so the pending work is uh there was a

358
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,359
request

359
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,800
from kenichi that if we can describe

360
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,279
this in

361
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,839
a buy a figure so that has been us so we

362
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,480
have

363
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
a figure pending that we will add for vm

364
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
compute

365
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
uh there are some editorial comments

366
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
that are still pending from tom petch i

367
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,959
kind of missed them when i was updating

368
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,079
i i realized it later so when i was

369
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,518
making these slides

370
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,040
so i will uh update on that and as i

371
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,040
said earlier that i think we are ready

372
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,399
for uh yang doctor

373
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,920
review so this uh finishes the vn

374
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,440
compute if you have any questions i

375
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,319
think you can jump to the queue i can

376
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,639
answer

377
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,160
right now or at the end of all the three

378
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,279
presentations either way it's good with

379
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,760
me

380
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,000
but i'll continue to save some time so

381
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
the next update is the kpi telemetry

382
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,199
yank

383
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
we have two yang models here which

384
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,519
augments the t

385
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,160
model and the vn model it adds the

386
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,760
various

387
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,160
pm telemetry uh characteristics as well

388
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,519
as the scaling intent mechanism

389
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,120
into these two model this allows the

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,199
customer to subscribe to

391
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,240
whether at the vl level or at the t

392
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,279
tunnel level

393
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,600
uh various uh pm characteristics as well

394
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,480
as

395
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,199
uh we have a concept called automatic uh

396
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,240
uh

397
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,800
autonomic scaling intent which has been

398
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
been there from the start so the update

399
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,880
in this document

400
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,440
next slide is uh

401
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,399
it's pretty basic we had a change added

402
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
some

403
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,000
editorial cleanup of the yang model

404
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,320
there were some references that were

405
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
incorrect so that got fixed we had a

406
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,199
comment that we should describe

407
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
uh how the vl level performance metric

408
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,839
is

409
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,199
calculated so we have added that detail

410
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,279
in the description

411
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,599
uh of how at the vl level these metrics

412
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,839
are computed which is usually the max of

413
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,040
the vn members

414
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:21,759
so that's the minimal change in this

415
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:25,199
document the next what we have

416
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,880
uh next slide so next we have the te

417
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,920
service mapping gang

418
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,800
uh as i said this there are a bunch of

419
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,560
augmentation in this model i will just

420
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,599
quickly describe what this model is in

421
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,758
the next slide

422
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
so the role of this tea service mapping

423
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,279
model is to create

424
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,119
a mapping relationship between various

425
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,800
service models that we have

426
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,320
in itf l3 sm l2 sm layer 1

427
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,839
csm as well as uh we also allow the same

428
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,720
grouping to be used for the network

429
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
models

430
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,959
as well and we map these uh service and

431
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
network model to

432
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,240
our these yang models at various levels

433
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,199
at the topology level at the tunnel

434
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,480
level

435
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,400
or at the vn level so the main reason

436
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
why we do this so that we could have a

437
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,880
very seamless service operation

438
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,159
that when the customer is thinking in

439
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,400
terms of l3 sm

440
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,280
and underlying there are te tunnels

441
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,760
involved

442
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,678
we have a a mapping between how those

443
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
services are being delivered

444
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,960
uh uh using the un underlay te resources

445
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
this allows us to do various monitoring

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,480
diagnostic

447
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,280
and various other things uh to maintain

448
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
this

449
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,879
mapping next slide so

450
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,879
uh what what has been updated as you

451
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
know l3 and m and l2 nm

452
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,799
uh were added in the last update which

453
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
we discussed in the working group we

454
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,600
added a thing called tea mapping

455
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,600
template

456
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,959
there was a support for sr policy that

457
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,760
was added so these were all

458
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
the changes that we made uh last time

459
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,960
and they were a comment

460
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,559
on the mailing list again from kenichi

461
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,440
and we are very thankful for

462
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,160
or to him to come to come up with new

463
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,480
use cases

464
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,280
as he's implementing this model so one

465
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,320
requirement

466
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,520
that they had was they wanted to map one

467
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
l3 sm to

468
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,799
actually multiple vm models and they

469
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,960
said

470
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,000
that they have a use case that that is

471
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
use

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,120
that is needed for this and we discussed

473
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
on the list uh

474
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,639
it doesn't harm us uh to have a mapping

475
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,960
i think the most

476
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
usual case would be one is to one case

477
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,919
but if an operator wants to

478
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,440
further break it down into multiple vms

479
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
and maintain them separately for some

480
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,080
reason

481
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
it doesn't harm from the yang modeling

482
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,000
point of view so that's why

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,679
this change has been made and this was

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,480
discussed on the list

485
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,240
in the past as well apart from that the

486
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,280
changes were there were some errors in

487
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,520
our ex parts

488
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,600
that were pointed out to us which we

489
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,360
have fixed

490
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,280
after posting this update there was some

491
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,520
more discussion which is on the next

492
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,320
slide

493
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,960
where kenichi asked us to also handle

494
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,840
kios

495
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,720
profile which uh i will uh describe so

496
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,439
the what you see

497
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,039
are the two further augments that we

498
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,320
discussed on the mailing list that

499
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,679
uh that needs to be added which is

500
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,240
at the l3 vpn site level they have

501
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,799
a keyos profile and they allow you to

502
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
create

503
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
a custom qos profile and give

504
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
constraints

505
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,000
etc right there at the site level so

506
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
there

507
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
they wanted to maintain a mapping

508
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,039
between uh

509
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
these custom qos profile and the vnap

510
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,440
that is created

511
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,720
by our uh to to service this

512
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,559
uh this custom qos profile so that one

513
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,480
is to one mapping we are maintaining

514
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
maintaining it here so we wanted to get

515
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,520
more feedback

516
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,678
uh from people especially who have

517
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,760
implemented l3sm and have

518
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,720
uh feedback on this whether this augment

519
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
makes sense

520
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,840
and if

521
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,360
needs to change we will we will make

522
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,520
that change in the next slide

523
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,039
and that covers all the changes that we

524
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,639
have made in the last

525
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:21,840
uh these three yang models uh

526
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
any comments

527
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,840
see oscar is

528
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:49,840
oscar quite

529
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,120
there is a unmute button on the top the

530
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,120
mic button

531
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:07,039
ah now can you hear me now okay

532
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,080
that one so my question is in

533
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,640
in the latest uh i changed

534
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,760
that you that was proposed it was

535
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,200
announced on

536
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,080
l3sm to map the qs so would that also

537
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,600
apply

538
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,600
12 12 3 nm

539
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
yeah i think that's a very good uh

540
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
question uh

541
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
i i feel like you know that custom keyos

542
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,200
class if it is

543
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,720
existing in the l3 nm then of course it

544
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,240
would i have to check whether that's the

545
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,559
case or not and i think you can answer

546
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
it

547
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,399
right away you would know whether you

548
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,120
have something like custom qs profile

549
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,840
in l3 and m as well we have all the

550
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,639
profiles

551
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,760
because they apply also to the they

552
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,559
apply to both

553
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,559
a service model and a network model the

554
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,559
profiles applied to both

555
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,158
yeah so then i would definitely augment

556
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,158
both

557
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
this is just an example for l3sm i'll

558
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,360
make sure that that's applicable

559
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:13,840
for every other place where it's needed

560
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:13,840
okay thank you

561
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,240
is

562
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
okay guess not

563
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,880
we can proceed thank you

564
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,840
next up is dan

565
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
hi chairs um i was actually going to

566
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,760
present my screen remotely if possible

567
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,760
i've just requested

568
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,559
the screen okay

569
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,600
can you hear me clearly we can yeah i'm

570
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
trying to grant it

571
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:11,360
maybe i have to stop her

572
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,360
uh yeah yes okay let's see if this works

573
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,520
i'll be a guinea pig

574
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,199
i actually appreciate that better for us

575
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
oh you're very welcome

576
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,880
okay uh hi guys it's uh it's morning

577
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,199
here uh in the uk

578
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
i'll be talking about the applicability

579
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,480
of ac

580
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:32,000
tn to poi packet optical integration

581
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,840
there is um two documents actually that

582
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,039
uh attempted to show the applicability

583
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,918
of actn to

584
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
poi and actually the document uh that

585
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
you see

586
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,559
currently is the merger of these

587
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,799
efforts that's why we we do have quite

588
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
an

589
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,879
exhaustive list of sort of authors and

590
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,440
contributors you know good percentage

591
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,360
actually of the tease working group

592
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,039
um so what is the intention of the work

593
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,719
it's really to show uh almost a cookbook

594
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
of how you would take

595
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,559
the functional architecture of actn

596
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,400
the various functional components the

597
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,918
specific interfaces

598
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,799
and what procedures and protocols

599
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,240
specifically data models you would use

600
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,520
in order to

601
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,039
set up and operate packet over

602
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,639
optical services so this is um

603
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:31,919
really important i think work because it

604
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,279
it highlights all of the the discussions

605
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,159
that we're having with sort of the

606
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,480
separate

607
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,200
um protocols and data models and how we

608
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
will

609
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,480
use those in order to sort of deploy

610
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,240
these

611
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,480
services and from an operator

612
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,000
perspective as well as a vendor

613
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
perspective it's important to know if

614
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,440
these procedures and models are actually

615
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,120
suitable and

616
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,120
and fit for purpose we spend all this

617
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,000
time actually developing

618
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,639
uh yang models but you know how

619
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,600
efficient

620
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,919
are they and you know what are the gaps

621
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
uh

622
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,440
tends to be sort of uh after we've

623
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,720
deployed them in the field if there

624
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,279
isn't sufficient

625
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,760
um interrupt or implementation early on

626
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,880
in the

627
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,080
development of the document itself and

628
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,720
so we we know actually that

629
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,158
um the focus of the work is going to be

630
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,320
on the southbound interfaces

631
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
so it's predominantly between the

632
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,360
multi-domain service coordinator

633
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,159
and the underlying uh controllers

634
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,439
or managers you say the the physical the

635
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,799
packet physical

636
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,840
and the optical physical uh network

637
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,480
controller and ideally um

638
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,760
when we finish the work we will have a

639
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,360
fairly good

640
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,760
uh understanding of uh

641
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,760
what are the available models some are

642
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,600
optional you know how are they used

643
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:55,039
uh were there specific implementation

644
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,080
or technology gaps uh are there

645
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,120
operational management security issues

646
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,520
that that were not

647
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,959
identified uh during the development of

648
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,080
of some of these procedures

649
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,480
and protocols so

650
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,439
how about a reference architecture well

651
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,760
it's fairly

652
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,799
um formulaic essentially it's sort of

653
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,158
four domains

654
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,000
um so we have a hierarchy of

655
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,440
our packet layer that sits on top of the

656
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,679
optical layer and then

657
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
sort of uh sort of horizontally we've

658
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,400
got domain one

659
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:29,520
uh and domain two um and

660
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,480
these these interfaces in black uh are

661
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,799
between the

662
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,559
uh mdse and then the packet and the

663
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,200
optical uh pncs

664
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,120
uh respectively and then we've got a

665
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,559
further set of interfaces between

666
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,840
um the pnc and the optical uh pnc

667
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,399
to the actual layer the technology

668
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,039
domain

669
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,159
where the the actual sort of nodes uh

670
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,158
sit

671
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:57,440
and you already um there are a number of

672
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,360
generic and technology-specific models

673
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,960
that we can use

674
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,120
and we're seeing a number of kind of

675
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,279
not necessarily issues but some sort of

676
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,719
clarifications that that may be needed

677
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,600
there and i'll cover that a little bit

678
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,799
later

679
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,918
um what isn't in scope

680
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,520
uh of course is above the mdse but

681
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
it it turns out actually that some of

682
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,559
the operators who are involved in the

683
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,240
work are

684
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,678
uh very interested in sort of having

685
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,360
that discussion but

686
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,799
for the time being it's it's kind of out

687
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,279
of scope

688
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,240
so if you were to read the document in

689
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,799
its current form

690
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,360
uh we've we've managed to do sort of the

691
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,960
first

692
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,879
uh pass of merging the sort of prior

693
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,279
prior two documents that i highlighted

694
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,880
earlier so we currently have

695
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,919
uh two phases that we're working on

696
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,159
phases or scenarios i suppose uh you

697
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,080
might call these but it's it's how we

698
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,559
generate the um the view of the network

699
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,439
so

700
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,158
our sort of physical network topology

701
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,520
discovery

702
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,640
and then existing service

703
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,720
topology discovery uh how that

704
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
information is carried between the

705
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,520
various pncs

706
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,960
uh to the mdsc there are some sort of

707
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,158
procedures some aspects sort of

708
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,919
operationally that

709
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,399
that are kind of interesting to consider

710
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,679
and

711
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,600
and this includes things like the link

712
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,640
discoveries and the attachments

713
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,120
um discovery so some

714
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,640
operators might see this discovery

715
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
mechanism as being a

716
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,559
a sort of security risk you know other

717
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,600
operators may see it as

718
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,720
something that would be nice to have so

719
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,399
whether it's static

720
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,039
whether there's some sort of automated

721
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,320
uh process that that's kind of

722
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
some of the discussion that we're having

723
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
in the document currently

724
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,000
so i mentioned already that uh we've

725
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
identified

726
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,280
the common young models you know so the

727
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,399
tea

728
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,720
[Music]

729
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,639
service and the topology young models

730
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,880
and then we've got our

731
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,240
sort of technology specific extensions

732
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,679
or augmentations

733
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,480
that we're using as well and and this is

734
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,480
essentially the the ingredients that

735
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,159
we're using as part of our

736
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,679
our cookbook there are of course um some

737
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,960
uh service models um that that we

738
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,240
are considering as well uh for

739
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,559
some of the the packet aspects um sorry

740
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,360
not

741
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,240
serve service model network model so our

742
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,520
l2 nm

743
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,399
and our l3 and m uh models there

744
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,520
and another aspect to consider here is

745
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,360
the

746
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:43,039
um the the ongoing discussion whether

747
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,918
to use the the the uni topo versus

748
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,720
client topo so essentially um your what

749
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,760
augments

750
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,919
uh rfc 8345 with the service attach

751
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,879
attachment point abstraction discussion

752
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,679
we know that

753
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,559
that what we're sort of highlighting in

754
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600
our document

755
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,840
is occurring as a parallel discussion

756
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,520
in things like the ops area and actually

757
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,879
sort of in in other

758
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,559
documents here in teas and also ccamp so

759
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,760
there are some discussion points around

760
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:16,639
um around the implementation of of uh

761
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,279
htm and poi that that are still ongoing

762
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
so

763
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,360
clearly um the work that we're doing is

764
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,159
just kind of feeding into some of that

765
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,279
parallel

766
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,200
discussion uh good

767
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,880
um so i think i just highlighted

768
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,640
actually some of the chapters

769
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,720
or sections uh in our in our document

770
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,320
so if if have read the document

771
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,159
you may have noticed there's actually

772
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,720
quite a lot of text and

773
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,320
and of clearly you know i'm sure the

774
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,600
chairs and certainly the isg would

775
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,320
appreciate brevity

776
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
or succinctness uh with with this type

777
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
of document

778
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,360
but i just want to kind of highlight

779
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,439
actually that because there are

780
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,279
sort of so many options and and various

781
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,679
permutations it's really important i

782
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,799
think

783
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,679
to document some of our assumptions

784
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,480
and maybe going forward we can actually

785
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,200
uh

786
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,720
prune you know or distill um some of

787
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
this discussion text

788
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,360
to make it uh sort of a little less

789
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,480
bloaty in the document but at least for

790
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,439
the time being we've just kind of

791
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,080
captured

792
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,679
all of the discussion and probably sort

793
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,760
of spent too much

794
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,279
effort uh working on our assumptions and

795
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,120
documenting those assumptions so maybe

796
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,480
going forward we will definitely try to

797
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,000
prune that text down

798
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
but some of the meat of the document

799
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,799
here are is contained within section

800
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,639
four

801
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,039
because this is you know how we actually

802
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,279
um solve some of these

803
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,200
scenarios so as i mentioned already you

804
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,120
know how we populate the topology

805
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,480
uh and current connectivity and then how

806
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,760
we establish uh

807
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,840
our sort of optical and then packet

808
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,960
services on top of that

809
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,320
so what are we currently uh working on

810
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,960
well there are at numerous open

811
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,158
issues uh these are sort of tracked here

812
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,880
sort of the

813
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,399
the current uh trend seems to be to use

814
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,799
uh github and

815
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,158
we will be mindful of course not to do

816
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,519
all of our work

817
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,200
by github uh what we will uh

818
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,559
sort of attempt to continue and i hope

819
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,880
we've achieved this

820
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:20,080
so far is to address some of the

821
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,559
uh sort of the issues uh the open

822
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,320
uh discussion points for instance there

823
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,600
may be you know how we discover

824
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,120
and populate uh inventory um in the mdsc

825
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,199
from the pncs

826
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,959
um what are the service attachment

827
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,360
points that we're using versus

828
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,600
some of the discussion around um uni and

829
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,678
client and what's actually being exposed

830
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,360
you these these are discussions that can

831
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,279
occur ideally on

832
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,559
the t's working list um

833
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,360
mailing list but we will also be

834
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,320
sort of discussing these during our

835
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,760
almost

836
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,799
weekly call that we actually have for

837
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,559
this particular piece of work and then

838
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,080
reporting some of the findings some of

839
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
the conclusions that we reach on these

840
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,399
separate calls

841
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,760
on the mailing list itself some of them

842
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:09,840
the other sort of hot topics at the

843
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,320
moment are around isolation we know that

844
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,678
sort of

845
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:18,480
um you know network slicing uh

846
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:22,240
and and isolation so sort of

847
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,360
providing circuits providing

848
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,240
a bandwidth to your particular

849
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,080
customers or particular um topologies

850
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,720
that are then represented in the mds

851
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,279
kind of a

852
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,480
a hot topic and whether that's uh uh

853
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,120
soft or hard

854
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,320
isolation continues to be an ongoing

855
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,559
discussion

856
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,240
uh what what we haven't addressed in the

857
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,799
document that that will be

858
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,159
uh in the next version are some of the

859
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,320
some of the additional operational

860
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,880
issues and drew just kind of highlighted

861
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
that

862
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,559
with some of the telemetry discussion on

863
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,399
the previous talk so

864
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,559
not only of course are we providing

865
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,399
network connectivity for sort of packing

866
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,440
over optical services but

867
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,399
we almost certainly will want to monitor

868
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,960
that

869
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,840
connectivity and in the event of some

870
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,480
kind of degrade

871
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
in service uh and certainly lots of

872
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,679
connectivity it needs to be reported

873
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,078
um adequately um and uh

874
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,960
appropriate action needs to be changed

875
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,520
or appropriate

876
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,480
action needs to be taken and potential

877
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,000
network changes

878
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,280
uh will incur what what isn't as

879
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,679
sort of discussed in the document

880
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,040
currently is is things like sort of um

881
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,560
pre-computed path um protection

882
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,639
for either type of service that seems to

883
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,199
be just a a step too far at this point

884
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,040
thank you i think those are um all the

885
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,598
slides i have

886
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,000
okay we have joel in the queue uh joel

887
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,760
go ahead

888
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,599
i wasn't going to raise this but since

889
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,800
you made a point of mentioning

890
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,359
isolation may i suggest you don't

891
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,000
talk in terms of isolation did you talk

892
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:00,319
in terms of

893
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,040
observable service parameters confidence

894
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,680
of delivering

895
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
observable service parameters and at

896
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,879
least until

897
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,960
there is actual working group agreement

898
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,640
on what the heck isolation means and how

899
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,359
it's supposed to be related to anything

900
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,480
else

901
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,560
just stay away from it

902
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,079
point taken clearly understood

903
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,320
thanks joel that's a that's a great

904
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,320
point

905
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,640
okay anybody else

906
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,160
uh thanks dan uh adrian you're up next

907
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,240
great

908
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,160
just wait for that slide to show up uh

909
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,440
so this

910
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,118
is uh rsc

911
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,320
320 bis so 3272

912
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,480
is the um overview

913
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
and discussion document for traffic

914
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,400
engineering in the internet

915
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:01,119
and way back we decided

916
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,680
uh that it would be helpful to update

917
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,880
this

918
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,839
old document so we did um

919
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,560
a couple of revisions and then it got

920
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,759
adopted

921
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,720
in july um uh

922
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,440
and it has been silent since then and in

923
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,160
my opinion

924
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,640
silence is not particularly helpful it

925
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,920
is not indicative of work in progress

926
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,400
it's uh really indicative of

927
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,400
nobody having the energy so

928
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,440
since i

929
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,480
had volunteered in inverted commerce to

930
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,760
be the editor of the work

931
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,720
i updated uh in uh

932
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,280
early july just to capture a couple of

933
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,560
points

934
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,440
that were raised during the adoption

935
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,560
poll

936
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,160
uh in particular um

937
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,520
whether the uh components of traffic

938
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,960
engineering

939
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,520
all needed to be present for a system to

940
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,160
be

941
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,839
truly traffic engineering and this is

942
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,920
phrased in terms now of

943
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,920
te versus partial t e

944
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,759
uh since then uh i've embarked on

945
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,760
editorial polish so going through

946
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,359
the the text which was

947
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,720
i think somewhat in uh daniel leduc's

948
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,799
uh tone of voice and

949
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,439
uh been polishing it a little bit um

950
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,320
the o2 came out start of the month where

951
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,920
i'd reached

952
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,599
uh 2.4.1 i've just posted

953
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,480
03 today where i have reached

954
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,400
section 5.3 which is almost exactly

955
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,000
halfway through the document

956
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,680
so i'll keep working on that um

957
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,320
and from here on the choice of how we

958
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,359
proceed

959
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,960
is either uh

960
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:06,240
we get some input from the working group

961
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,599
anyone or everyone and that's

962
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,520
edits or text suggestions or comments or

963
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,119
complaints

964
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,240
there are seven sections

965
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,240
needing technical overview material

966
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,640
they're all marked tbds they're very

967
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:26,000
easy to find in the document

968
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,359
and they cover quick igpte

969
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,640
alto network slicing

970
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:35,440
deterministic networking sdn and

971
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,319
intent based networking and if anybody

972
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,320
wants to

973
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,160
supply text for any of those sections

974
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,560
that would be most welcome

975
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,319
you might drop a note to the list just

976
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,240
to say you're doing it

977
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:52,240
so that nobody else works on the same

978
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,759
section at the same time so failing

979
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:59,520
anybody else doing anything my plan

980
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,880
would be to complete the document

981
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,160
by christmas myself either

982
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,800
um by um

983
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,560
carefully polishing or hitting it with a

984
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,520
hammer depending on

985
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,720
how short of time i am and then uh

986
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,079
asking the chairs

987
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,480
to get on and last call it uh in the new

988
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,000
year

989
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,160
as early as possible uh because

990
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,760
one way or the other it's i think it's

991
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,720
clear that the working group will have

992
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,040
finished

993
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,560
whatever it thinks needs doing and we

994
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,000
need to get that review and

995
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,000
and be finished that's it

996
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,359
any comments

997
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,720
so i see someone typing in comey md a

998
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,440
comment

999
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,839
it would be good if they uh made the

1000
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,839
comment

1001
00:39:52,079 --> 00:40:00,240
jeff good

1002
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,560
hello yeah jeff go ahead oh

1003
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,520
oh you can help me i'll do the intel

1004
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,520
based networking part

1005
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,800
lovely thank you i'll do it on daily

1006
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,359
basis

1007
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,359
which day

1008
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,078
every day that's you

1009
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,480
that's your intent yep i have great

1010
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,839
intentions

1011
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,160
we have drew and boris next through

1012
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,160
good

1013
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,720
working group i think when we started

1014
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,839
out this work our main intention was

1015
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,480
that we can point

1016
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,560
to this document when somebody outside

1017
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,960
the working group may be brte comes to

1018
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,400
mind

1019
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,599
and sr policy and srte discussion that

1020
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,920
we had

1021
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,079
so should we also evangelize this work

1022
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,960
and say like look we have now a good

1023
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,800
reference

1024
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,319
being ready and see if outside the

1025
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,560
working group people

1026
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,000
can start using it and that could also

1027
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,880
give us some inputs whether

1028
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,640
we have succeeded in our mission in

1029
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,760
clarifying what is te

1030
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,560
in 2020 i think uh

1031
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
i'm picking that from the bottom yes if

1032
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,599
if

1033
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,640
um if people are able to use it it will

1034
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,400
give us a good

1035
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:20,000
idea that we've done a good job um

1036
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,119
but um before pushing it out

1037
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,599
for other people um with us saying this

1038
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,800
is

1039
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,839
the reference i would like to hear more

1040
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,200
than just me

1041
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,560
saying this is um this document

1042
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,560
captures our opinion

1043
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,560
and i'm not hearing that at the moment

1044
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,960
okay boris

1045
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,359
okay so just as

1046
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,200
jeff mentioned i also would like to

1047
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,440
volunteer and help you

1048
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,480
with those additional text pieces

1049
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,240
that would be perfect so please have a

1050
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,520
have a look at the document

1051
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,040
um grab a section and write some text

1052
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,800
i'm only looking for each of these

1053
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,319
sections i'm only looking for sort of

1054
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,480
three paragraphs

1055
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,839
otherwise the document becomes

1056
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,440
unbalanced

1057
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:21,200
so it shouldn't be big work

1058
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,359
okay got it

1059
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,960
okay thanks adrian thanks for driving

1060
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,279
this forward uh

1061
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,880
there is still a fair bit of work to be

1062
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,800
done so if anyone is interested in

1063
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,839
contributing uh please do reach out to

1064
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
adrian and

1065
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,799
see how you can help

1066
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,839
we are now moving to that segment of the

1067
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,599
session for which

1068
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,680
most of you have been waiting for and

1069
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,680
are up but not are

1070
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,040
75 minutes of network slicing topics

1071
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,078
coming up

1072
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,079
so after the last ietf we did

1073
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,079
an adoption poll for a couple of

1074
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,240
documents that were

1075
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,560
produced by the design team the calls

1076
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,879
failed but it did generate a lot of

1077
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,160
great discussion uh it sort of resulted

1078
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,839
in a bit of a research

1079
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,319
uh resetting with respect to the

1080
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:08,720
terminology the authors have been

1081
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,079
focusing on addressing uh the comments

1082
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,799
that were raised during the adoption

1083
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,640
poll and

1084
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,839
we will hear from them about it in a

1085
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,078
little bit

1086
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,000
uh the discussion on the list uh seems

1087
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
to suggest that we are converging on

1088
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,280
some

1089
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,799
controversial items so uh like everyone

1090
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,920
else i'm also eager to see how this

1091
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,079
session progresses

1092
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,280
so before we bring yari in to give a

1093
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,160
brief update on

1094
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,720
the design team um do you have anything

1095
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,720
else to add

1096
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,200
we'll see how it goes today and figure

1097
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:46,079
out what the right next step is

1098
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,078
so thanks for the intro and over to yari

1099
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,960
okay do you hear me okay you can

1100
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,720
yeah so if you can just move to the next

1101
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,640
slide so my intent

1102
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,160
was not to speak at length just sort of

1103
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,879
give a very high level

1104
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,160
status report and you know way forward

1105
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,000
and

1106
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,279
you know where are we and where where

1107
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,119
are we not um

1108
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,680
so as vishnu mentioned we attempted to

1109
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,040
do a working adoption in august or in

1110
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,319
the summer

1111
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,279
which didn't succeed but i think there's

1112
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,400
reason to

1113
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,440
think that we can succeed and we are

1114
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,760
close uh the issues during the summer

1115
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,119
were primarily around terminology

1116
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,760
names in particular and isolation a few

1117
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
other

1118
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,839
topics and since then a lot of work has

1119
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,200
happened a lot of discussion has

1120
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,599
happened

1121
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,919
revisions have been made i believe on

1122
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,880
the name issue of

1123
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,280
or calling these terms a particular

1124
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
thing

1125
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,280
is that that's a solved issue

1126
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,078
but uh one would observe that once you

1127
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,160
move

1128
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,319
past some issue like this like you don't

1129
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,799
like the name of a thing

1130
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,680
it's only then that some people actually

1131
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,839
get to

1132
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,680
think more about the actual content or

1133
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,160
substance of things so i think some of

1134
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,319
the

1135
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,319
discussions that we've seen recently is

1136
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,079
in that category that okay now we sort

1137
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,720
of put that thing past us but let's

1138
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,359
now look at what the thing actually says

1139
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,879
and so

1140
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,040
adrienne's drive for more accurate

1141
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,359
definitions is in this category some of

1142
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,319
the discussion isolation

1143
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,960
some discussion on scope and so forth

1144
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,319
screens

1145
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,319
changing okay now it's back

1146
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
i think my advice at least for this is

1147
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,560
that we should find

1148
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,880
what we have what is the commonly

1149
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,160
acceptable minimal set of things and

1150
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,560
move on

1151
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,680
the reason for that is really that uh i

1152
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,400
mean there's a lot of things that we

1153
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,480
could do

1154
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,839
let's let's agree on the on the simple

1155
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,079
things

1156
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,920
and uh the the concepts discussed here

1157
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,920
are actually important for other work

1158
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,000
and maybe not in terms of like actual

1159
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,160
reference to

1160
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,839
you know document dependency as such but

1161
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,399
there's a lot of work that sort of

1162
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,440
you know enters the space one way or the

1163
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,079
other

1164
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,760
and um if we actually had some agreement

1165
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,640
about the terms what are we even talking

1166
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,240
about

1167
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,480
and i think that would be beneficial to

1168
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,839
keep the keep the thing together

1169
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,800
um and uh so for instance anything

1170
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,440
that's discussed

1171
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,160
in in in this section of the agenda like

1172
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,280
it's

1173
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,560
highly dependent on this so um and the

1174
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,119
final comment is that

1175
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,720
uh you know the we had a design team uh

1176
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,280
the design team produced some results

1177
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,160
that were

1178
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,040
discussed by the working group and we've

1179
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
intentionally

1180
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,160
wanted to move the discussion to the

1181
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,440
working group like it's not that the

1182
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,000
design team has much

1183
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,880
that much discussions it's mostly

1184
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
practical if

1185
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,440
if anything so

1186
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,680
everything is really in the hands of the

1187
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,599
working group and so

1188
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,680
you know we we design team have no

1189
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,520
particular status

1190
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,919
the authors can propose stuff and they

1191
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,599
they have and they revise documents

1192
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,200
thank you for that but i think the

1193
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,760
agreement needs to be found

1194
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,839
in the working group amongst all of us

1195
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,160
so so i think that's the

1196
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,000
setup for kiran and others to start

1197
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:08,399
talking about the actual details

1198
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,520
and substance so i think i'm done here

1199
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,040
unless people have

1200
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,920
high level comments at this point where

1201
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,920
i think we can move on

1202
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,839
any comments

1203
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:39,839
i'll be back

1204
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,160
for providing the overview and

1205
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,680
let's get into the details of what we

1206
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,000
have been doing

1207
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,960
specifically from the definitions draft

1208
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,280
perspective

1209
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,160
and as you notice the name of the draft

1210
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,319
has changed

1211
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,558
and i'll just provide an update on

1212
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,440
behalf of all the authors

1213
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,440
next slide please

1214
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,559
um so an overview of the changes so

1215
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,000
things you look at the

1216
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,119
left column they have been pretty stable

1217
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,319
even if we have gone through um

1218
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,839
different discussions in between two

1219
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,240
itfs

1220
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,400
108 and 109 and interim meeting

1221
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,799
our core definition hasn't changed the

1222
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,119
way we describe the characteristics of

1223
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,040
structure and stakeholders different

1224
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,760
sections they haven't changed a whole

1225
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,040
lot in terms of the content

1226
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,480
what we did bring change was related to

1227
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,520
the naming of course

1228
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,880
and then we improved some of the text

1229
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,119
related to sli and slos because they are

1230
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,240
also the core part of the concept that

1231
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,839
we are bringing in with network slices

1232
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,399
and there was an action item to bring in

1233
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,839
some

1234
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,520
text for isolation we also got a

1235
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,520
feedback that

1236
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,040
security consideration should not be

1237
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,400
left empty so

1238
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,400
some text was provided there and um

1239
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,640
we also got some feedback to remove

1240
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,920
a lot of descriptive text from the

1241
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,759
document and

1242
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,280
probably make it a candidate for

1243
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:31,839
framework um

1244
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,839
draft later on next slide please

1245
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:36,079
so in interim meeting it was um

1246
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,599
mentioned that

1247
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,960
transport slice is as the name is not

1248
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,200
acceptable it was non-starter

1249
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
so we pulled the mailing list came up

1250
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,078
with 14 suggestions

1251
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,800
and it seems that idf network slice was

1252
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,800
the

1253
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,359
name which was majorly selected

1254
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,079
and if you want to see the pluses and

1255
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,799
minuses

1256
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,000
of all the names mentioned here i have

1257
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,319
attached two slides

1258
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,119
at the bottom so you can look at it

1259
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,000
later on

1260
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,000
next slide please

1261
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,359
and once we change the name how things

1262
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,640
how rest of the content changed into the

1263
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:19,598
document

1264
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,240
um now we don't have transport slices we

1265
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,079
specific

1266
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,000
we very clearly defined that we are

1267
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:27,440
talking about ietf scoped

1268
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,280
network in our document we qualify term

1269
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,760
ietf because there was

1270
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,960
a great amount of discussion that there

1271
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,680
are other

1272
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,680
parts in the network where you would use

1273
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,680
network slicing so ietf

1274
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,118
network slices not an end-to-end

1275
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,440
solution so

1276
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,319
having some kind of a prefix or a

1277
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:49,599
qualifying term for ietf technologies

1278
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,160
was necessary and the definition remains

1279
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:52,480
the same

1280
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,879
whatever we had as transport controller

1281
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,800
is now called idf network slice

1282
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,520
controller and accordingly we have

1283
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,559
changed

1284
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,440
nses and nsres as well

1285
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
next slide please

1286
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,960
and in terms of improvement i got

1287
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,000
um a lot of review comments mainly from

1288
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,800
adrian where we kind of restructured the

1289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,960
document

1290
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,880
changed the nesting in the sense some

1291
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,079
sections were pulled out at the top

1292
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,280
level

1293
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,319
and that we also deleted lot of stuff to

1294
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,359
make document

1295
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,839
more readable and i mentioned earlier

1296
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,960
that

1297
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:36,799
now we have a better text for

1298
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,200
slo sli and it's easy to read also

1299
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,640
it blends in with rest of the sections

1300
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,879
much better

1301
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:47,359
and the there was a general

1302
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,040
feedback that you should not be talking

1303
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,319
about too many details about

1304
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:55,040
realization of the slices in this

1305
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,599
definitions draft so we took lot of

1306
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,720
section

1307
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,839
related to that and some of the use case

1308
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:05,118
description we had from the document

1309
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,520
we also had um quite a

1310
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,040
lot of discussion on what vertical or

1311
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:12,559
horizontal slices

1312
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,359
mean and we have taken that out for now

1313
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,119
and hopefully framework document will

1314
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:19,680
find some

1315
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,839
space for that kind of explanation but

1316
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,919
right now we just described the concepts

1317
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:25,040
that how you would extend the slices

1318
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:29,280
using

1319
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:33,839
um hierarchical or sequential mechanisms

1320
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,839
it's very brief right now next slide

1321
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,520
and so one of the major discussion was

1322
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,598
on isolation text

1323
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,079
and the the way we brought in the text

1324
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,200
is by explaining what we mean by

1325
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,160
isolation

1326
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,000
and the key point here we want to

1327
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,720
highlight is that

1328
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,920
from a consumer perspective there should

1329
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,118
be no negative

1330
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,040
impact on that customer slice

1331
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:04,800
whenever there are changes in other

1332
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,040
parts of the network

1333
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,040
and then we have added text to describe

1334
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:11,520
it in certain ways

1335
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,759
and another thing we want to highlight

1336
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,240
here is that customers should be able to

1337
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,000
ask

1338
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,319
for isolation explicitly yes it is

1339
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,480
possible that in some cases

1340
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:27,119
there are certain slos that will uh

1341
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,240
satisfy isolation requirement but in

1342
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,640
other cases the

1343
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,680
customer may have explicit requirement

1344
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,799
because

1345
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,279
they feel the need that okay i i feel

1346
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,760
that

1347
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,880
this thing will not negatively impact me

1348
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:44,160
so i would explicitly ask for that

1349
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:47,119
so we decided to keep that text there

1350
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,759
and i just described why it should be

1351
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,839
slo

1352
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,280
or not so we are not going to get into

1353
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:54,160
that debate

1354
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,520
and uh there was a discussion that we

1355
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,480
should just keep a play

1356
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,040
a placeholder and not provide any text

1357
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,559
before

1358
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,960
work grouping option but we felt that

1359
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,119
providing some text that we can refine

1360
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,119
going forward is much better than just

1361
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,680
leaving it blank

1362
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,680
next nextly

1363
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:21,440
and we still have a couple of review

1364
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,839
comments one is related to

1365
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,920
improve the security section further to

1366
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,000
describe it in a

1367
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,839
slightly better manner and we are

1368
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,319
working on it

1369
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:34,078
there was one comment from med on the

1370
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,480
mailing list that

1371
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,559
from his perspective the document still

1372
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,799
looks like

1373
00:54:37,559 --> 00:54:42,960
connectivity-centric and he needs to

1374
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,440
provide us some more comments where he

1375
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,760
thinks

1376
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,480
that something is missing and what is

1377
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,040
that

1378
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:51,200
thing that he would like to get added

1379
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:55,119
into the document

1380
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:58,319
next slide so this is where we

1381
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,520
are i personally think

1382
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:02,960
that we could go ahead with give a group

1383
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,559
adoption adoption

1384
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,799
mainly the reason is that a lot of

1385
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,440
people have contributed here

1386
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,480
and yes we are still discussing couple

1387
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,559
of items but

1388
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,799
by and large document has remained

1389
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,400
stable from last six months

1390
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,680
of course readability has improved a lot

1391
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,960
as we kept refining things and so the

1392
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,240
open issues are

1393
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,960
um rather incremental and

1394
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,399
hopefully we can converge on them so

1395
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,839
that was my last slide

1396
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,839
thank you

1397
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,400
i really wish you hadn't put in text on

1398
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,839
the isolation

1399
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,680
because i would really like to be able

1400
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,160
to adopt the document

1401
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:54,319
but the text you have put in doesn't

1402
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,558
work it isn't a definition

1403
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,079
it instead introduces ambiguity that

1404
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,720
maybe there's something here maybe there

1405
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,799
isn't

1406
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,000
we had agreed to leave placeholder in i

1407
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,400
was comfortable with having

1408
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,160
a section that said this is a topic

1409
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,079
that's under discussion

1410
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,319
and we could do it later but the text

1411
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,160
you put in doesn't work for me and if we

1412
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,319
if there's an adoption call

1413
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,520
with the text as it is given how

1414
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:18,240
misleading it is

1415
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,200
i would have to object to the adoption

1416
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,479
so that is

1417
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,200
um so what is the criteria for

1418
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,520
workgroup adoption we can still continue

1419
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,399
to

1420
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,079
improve the document after that i mean

1421
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,200
we need some starting tech

1422
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,040
text don't we no we don't need we don't

1423
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,399
need starting text on isolation the

1424
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,920
agreement was not

1425
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,280
that you were going to provide starting

1426
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,119
text the agreement was we're going to

1427
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,400
leave a placeholder in

1428
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,319
yes this is not done

1429
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,319
allow me to finish katan the working

1430
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:52,000
group can improve the document

1431
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,759
but at the same token though i am not as

1432
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,480
a work group member obliged to adopt

1433
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,079
text that i think is actually wrong

1434
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,240
and in this case i think the text you

1435
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,599
have put in is wrong

1436
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,439
and that's an obstacle tie to adoption

1437
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,720
places where it needs refinement i of

1438
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,559
course there's places that need

1439
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,959
refinement that doesn't bother me

1440
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,640
but when it's wrong and misleading and

1441
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,839
actively misleading as far as i'm

1442
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,720
concerned

1443
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,720
there's a problem

1444
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,240
okay so i have seen your replies on the

1445
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,240
mailing list also i understand where

1446
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:28,959
you're saying things are wrong

1447
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,439
but i haven't seen your definition of

1448
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,079
isolation how would you like to express

1449
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,960
it

1450
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,640
because i don't think a definition of

1451
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,280
isolation i don't believe the term is

1452
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,040
needed

1453
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,359
i'm willing to leave a placeholder so

1454
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,400
that people can propose text

1455
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:46,160
for discussion but i do not believe

1456
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:55,839
there is any need for the term therefore

1457
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:55,839
i am not going to propose a definition

1458
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,839
okay

1459
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,839
okay

1460
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,720
i wonder if anyone thinks they're

1461
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,920
talking because it's quite quiet

1462
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,279
that's what i was thinking i was

1463
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,280
wondering if my internet was working

1464
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,200
stuart is it your internet wow that

1465
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:19,839
explains a lot

1466
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,839
same situations

1467
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,480
apparently things work now

1468
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:33,839
i can see no i cannot see anything

1469
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:40,880
all of you i'll come back again

1470
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,118
uh seems like everybody got disconnected

1471
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,119
uh

1472
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:52,640
so can you guys hear me

1473
00:59:48,720 --> 01:00:01,839
can someone acknowledge i can hear you

1474
00:59:52,640 --> 01:00:01,839
yes bro okay

1475
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,319
give me one minute

1476
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:27,040
yeah i had some issue can you hear me

1477
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,599
yeah i think the the whole session

1478
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,720
dropped

1479
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:34,720
i mean it dropped for them oh okay

1480
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:43,839
okay okay i thought it's only me

1481
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:43,839
no no we can hear you reza okay

1482
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:57,520
okay the joy appears to be that there

1483
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,680
was a

1484
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,680
meat echo vm reboot

1485
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:11,839
okay

1486
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:28,558
so uh i think

1487
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,319
we were in the middle of a discussion

1488
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,359
with between joel

1489
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:36,720
and kiron

1490
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,640
yes see if we give people a minute i

1491
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,520
think we're about at the same head count

1492
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,520
we were before

1493
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:46,480
lou is it possible that you could

1494
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,680
unshare your screen

1495
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:53,839
there's just a black screen there

1496
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,839
the share space

1497
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,640
i don't see an issue

1498
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,440
now all i see is the black screen i'm

1499
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:05,440
republishing

1500
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,440
yes so we have both the black screen and

1501
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:12,400
the new screen

1502
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,400
elegant beat echo i don't know

1503
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,119
i would say click reload but i'm a

1504
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,839
little worried that you might not get

1505
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,839
back in

1506
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,598
yeah and in particular right now i don't

1507
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,280
need to see the screen for the

1508
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:29,680
conversation we were having

1509
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,400
or right so uh let me kick it off with a

1510
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,440
question

1511
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:37,039
to you all uh yes uh

1512
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,240
what i think i heard you say is that

1513
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,920
no definition of isolation would be

1514
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,680
acceptable to you

1515
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,000
that's not no i think that's what i

1516
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:49,118
heard you really say

1517
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,760
i don't well i do not believe there is a

1518
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,640
definition of isolation that is useful

1519
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,480
but i am perfectly willing to allow for

1520
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,839
discussion and proposal

1521
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,240
but the definition that has been

1522
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,680
proposed is not useful and i don't know

1523
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,680
of a useful definition

1524
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,359
so i can't very well propose one i mean

1525
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,440
tom said so joel why haven't you

1526
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,880
proposed a definition and the answer is

1527
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:16,640
because i don't think it's a useful

1528
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:20,400
concept to the task

1529
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,759
okay um i i think we can note that

1530
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:26,720
and um move to the

1531
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,319
person unless you have another point my

1532
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:31,839
problem with the text as it is

1533
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,839
is i consider it seriously misleading

1534
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,200
on the topic that's why i was perfectly

1535
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:39,839
willing to to the agreement you

1536
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,118
that you two chairs said we'll just put

1537
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:44,000
in a placeholder and we'll

1538
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,799
discuss separately what the definition

1539
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,079
might be

1540
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:52,640
okay uh have you

1541
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:59,839
expressed how you think it's flawed

1542
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:59,839
i believe so okay do you think

1543
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,880
is kieran back

1544
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:12,799
i didn't see her we have to wait

1545
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:16,240
come on

1546
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:19,119
okay here we go yes

1547
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,399
welcome back yeah sorry i didn't realize

1548
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,520
i was on mute

1549
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:26,960
so yes we have started some discussion

1550
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,480
and uh what we got was initially

1551
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,480
scratched text from

1552
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:32,160
people who are already in the queue to

1553
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,960
once answer that

1554
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,440
one feedback is we are going to strip

1555
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,520
down

1556
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,440
lot of information which is related to

1557
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:42,960
realization

1558
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:45,760
and have a minimal text so that

1559
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,520
there is a way to express isolation from

1560
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,079
a customer perspective

1561
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,160
that's what i'm looking for right now

1562
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,319
and we can have further discussions on

1563
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,279
the email list and that is why this text

1564
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,920
just here

1565
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,400
is there in the draft so that we can

1566
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,200
iteratively revise it so that everybody

1567
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,200
agrees to it

1568
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:09,119
and one thing we are clearly saying that

1569
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:12,319
we are not making taking a stance that

1570
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,920
isolation is always related to slo

1571
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:19,200
and it can be met by all the slos

1572
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:22,799
you could have additional parameters

1573
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,399
that or some additional characteristic

1574
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:27,440
which could come from

1575
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,839
a regulatory perspective or it could

1576
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,280
come from security side of things or the

1577
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:33,520
perception of

1578
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,480
the customer who wants to deploy that

1579
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,640
slice

1580
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,559
so we just want to provide a mechanism

1581
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,558
to express that characteristic

1582
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,879
i think it'd be really good to take this

1583
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:47,520
discussion more

1584
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,799
and follow it up on the list by joel if

1585
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,559
it's okay

1586
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,480
we have a bunch of people in the queue

1587
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:53,520
and we got a little delayed because of

1588
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,119
the meat echo

1589
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:56,559
i think it'd be good to give them an

1590
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,280
opportunity to speak as well if that's

1591
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,400
okay

1592
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:04,160
there okay thanks uh stuart

1593
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:06,640
europe um well i

1594
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,558
i will start with making a fundamental

1595
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,279
objection to the position

1596
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,160
that uh joel was taking it is not his

1597
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,559
working group

1598
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,598
it is not his right to object on behalf

1599
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,280
of the working group

1600
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,079
it is the working group to take a

1601
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,880
decision and he may or may not be in the

1602
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,640
rough

1603
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,559
and i think that's a position that the

1604
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,440
chairs should take

1605
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:31,039
um as to uh isolation i find it a useful

1606
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,640
concept

1607
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:37,920
and found it a useful concept in the uh

1608
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:40,078
days when we were working on vpn plus

1609
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:43,039
because it it to my mind it does

1610
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,760
describe um the concept of

1611
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:47,440
two services operating in different

1612
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,559
universes

1613
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,680
now we can work on text but

1614
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,400
i i don't i'm not sure why this why one

1615
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,118
objection

1616
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,839
by one person to one section should stop

1617
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,839
a draft progressing

1618
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,000
i think that's correct of chairs i have

1619
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,558
not uh heard it stopping for questing

1620
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,599
i've heard

1621
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:13,520
an individual's objection and uh

1622
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,960
you know it's duly noted and will

1623
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,359
continue to be discussed on the list but

1624
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,119
it's

1625
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:19,598
as you say it's just one individual's

1626
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,599
objection

1627
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,559
uh i think

1628
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,279
yeah um this is a difficult topic and

1629
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,240
you know this is the reason why i i said

1630
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,240
that it's important

1631
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,078
for us to agree on the pits that we we

1632
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,720
do agree and move on

1633
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,760
and uh actually um we had a really good

1634
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:45,279
process on this

1635
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,000
name issue like we had people propose

1636
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,280
alternatives you know you have an issue

1637
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,039
with what we had

1638
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,119
here's some alternatives that you know

1639
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:53,839
and pros and cons and let's discuss that

1640
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,880
and and

1641
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,078
make a decision we didn't quite follow

1642
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,119
the same process

1643
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,119
in in this other discussion um

1644
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,359
so it's more of like you know this is

1645
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,359
the this text and you know let's edit it

1646
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,319
if it needed or take away or not take

1647
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:10,720
away

1648
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,079
and so so we didn't really do this you

1649
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,238
know top-down thing that

1650
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:21,040
hey we could do a b or c or d

1651
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:22,639
here and i i think that was a mistake

1652
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,238
the discussion would have been easier if

1653
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,600
we had done that and

1654
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:28,000
maybe there's still time to do that

1655
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,600
perhaps but um

1656
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,439
yeah um so it should be noted that

1657
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,799
like lots of people do have differing

1658
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:38,000
opinions on this

1659
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:41,120
um aspect i i do too by

1660
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,719
the way i i think the

1661
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,399
current text is somewhat misleading

1662
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,040
there's been some discussion on the list

1663
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,358
actually if

1664
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,560
you follow those uh like adrian posted a

1665
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,520
suggestion

1666
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:55,359
of a fairly drastic cut down of the text

1667
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,920
joel has said that he doesn't like to

1668
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,640
mention it at all

1669
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,520
and and so on i actually agreed

1670
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,640
personally with

1671
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,640
adrian's proposal

1672
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,839
for me

1673
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,480
not not not like nailing down the things

1674
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,319
that we need to we need to do i think

1675
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,000
for me what's important here is that we

1676
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:23,600
do mention these concepts because

1677
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:26,000
it is talked about um in the industry

1678
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,960
um but we need to relate it to our

1679
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,238
concepts

1680
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,839
and and it we can't have the situation

1681
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,599
where we have like this

1682
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:35,439
concepts like you know you have reserved

1683
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,960
bandwidth and then wink wink you don't

1684
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,639
actually have a certain bandwidth but if

1685
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,359
you have this other property then you

1686
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,440
have

1687
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,199
reserved bandwidth but wink wink it

1688
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,759
doesn't actually work if you

1689
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:48,000
you know a note goes down and then you

1690
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,319
must have the third concept of false

1691
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,960
tolerance of some sort

1692
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,359
so you know there are some issues there

1693
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,000
and i

1694
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,600
i think we would do the industrial

1695
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,159
service if we actually sort of tried to

1696
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,239
relate

1697
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:01,599
the industry terms to what we are

1698
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,199
speaking about

1699
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,800
and i think that would be totally fine

1700
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:07,120
because we still are talking about

1701
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,520
isolation then in the document

1702
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,840
and uh we're not overselling it we're

1703
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,920
not confusing anything

1704
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,840
we are relating that you know this this

1705
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,640
aspect can be represented by those

1706
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,960
things

1707
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,880
that we have elsewhere in the document

1708
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,960
and and then we move on

1709
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,880
and the final comment is that like i

1710
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:26,960
think part of the objective that joel

1711
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,239
had was that you know whose default goes

1712
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,080
into the document

1713
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,919
like we have several opinions about this

1714
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,679
stuff obviously the working group

1715
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,719
decides

1716
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:39,360
all of us together um but uh

1717
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:40,560
but i understand his position that he

1718
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,799
doesn't want to start

1719
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,880
from you know somebody else's definition

1720
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,400
if he would like to have his definition

1721
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,159
perhaps or start from a

1722
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,239
blank sheet of paper where everybody is

1723
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:53,679
on the same

1724
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:55,360
position kind of so

1725
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,600
i you know if it was me i would either

1726
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,080
start with empty section placeholder

1727
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,400
or adrian's definition i'd be happy with

1728
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,400
adrian

1729
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,840
that's all i had thank you

1730
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,920
okay so uh jeff you're up and i'd like

1731
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,159
to

1732
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,239
cut the line if possible because we are

1733
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:17,599
well over on the slot

1734
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:19,440
sure so since i you just because

1735
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,120
i brought this term number of times to

1736
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,440
discuss with joel i actually stopped

1737
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,840
doing this because my impression is

1738
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,199
no definition will do anything i as long

1739
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,920
as it's mtmrk

1740
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,879
you put something that i'm unhappy so i

1741
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,199
mean it shouldn't be

1742
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:37,360
like this the definition i propose

1743
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:39,199
they come from my experience personal

1744
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:41,280
experience while

1745
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:42,320
it's not observable it's definitely

1746
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,519
something

1747
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:47,360
and customers should be able to request

1748
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,440
i've seen this in my life it's

1749
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,239
definitely business and working

1750
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,719
agreement so

1751
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,000
i believe it should be there whether

1752
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:56,320
it's under definition

1753
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,560
or whatever we already have in the draft

1754
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,080
we can find the text as long as we want

1755
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,880
to come with the text and some

1756
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,600
definitions

1757
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,600
not to oppose to anything so that's my

1758
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,840
position

1759
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:14,559
okay

1760
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,640
g

1761
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:30,400
jimmy i just want to can you hear me

1762
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:33,360
yeah good okay i just want to

1763
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,839
say that um actually because network

1764
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,639
lies

1765
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,360
the network slicing is not only defining

1766
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,960
itf

1767
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,920
and for the whole industry isolation is

1768
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,920
described in

1769
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,360
almost all the number slicing related

1770
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,400
documents

1771
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,519
and also in itf's history it has been

1772
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,519
mentioned

1773
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,520
in the vpn related requirements

1774
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,520
frameworks and solutions

1775
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:01,120
so my opinion is clarifying the meaning

1776
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:04,480
of isolation in the itf's context

1777
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,120
and its relationship with the other

1778
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:08,239
network slicing related activity would

1779
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:11,360
be

1780
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:13,839
really useful and we have been

1781
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:15,759
working hard to separate the requirement

1782
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,960
from the implementation

1783
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:21,040
of the isolation and i think

1784
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,000
many people give very good comments and

1785
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,280
suggestions

1786
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,400
and i hope we could work together to

1787
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,880
polish it rather than just say no we

1788
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:33,839
don't need

1789
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,840
it yeah that's my opinion

1790
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:37,199
thank you greg

1791
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:45,600
and uh the current document reflects uh

1792
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:48,639
their agreement of the design

1793
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,520
team or of their

1794
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:54,080
those who are listed as authors on this

1795
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,080
document

1796
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,440
sure what question you're really asking

1797
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,080
in the end

1798
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,040
we have to agree um as a working group

1799
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,600
what the term is

1800
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,280
so it's sort of you know whoever

1801
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,320
contributed to it doesn't have special

1802
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:13,120
standing

1803
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:14,080
um we have to reach consensus as a

1804
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,080
workforce

1805
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,800
so it's you know that's that's a

1806
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:22,000
starting point

1807
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:25,120
but because to my understanding is

1808
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,800
that there is no agreement

1809
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,760
within the design team whether isolation

1810
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,199
is something that

1811
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,199
observable or not

1812
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:42,800
so i i think that

1813
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:45,519
there is that's um

1814
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,920
since there is no agreement then why to

1815
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,920
have

1816
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:50,560
something which is questionable present

1817
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,000
to the working group for adoption

1818
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:57,360
um it's more logical is

1819
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,719
take it out work it on

1820
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:05,360
and when it's ready then

1821
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:07,440
working group can edit to the document

1822
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,960
because the working group when working

1823
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,480
group adopts a document

1824
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:13,040
is working group document and the

1825
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:18,000
working group decides

1826
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,000
uh their changes to the document

1827
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:24,960
so if there is no clear understanding

1828
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,520
of what isolation for the net network

1829
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,040
slice

1830
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,040
is then

1831
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:34,000
just work on it as a separate work item

1832
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,239
thank you that dave

1833
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:50,239
thanks after dave

1834
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,080
okay um yeah my comments are more along

1835
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:54,799
the lines of what greg just stated

1836
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,719
um i i think there there are differences

1837
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,320
of opinion i don't think it was asserted

1838
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,560
that it was just joel that had this

1839
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,159
opinion i don't think that's correct

1840
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,920
um it seems like something this

1841
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,839
controversial to the group

1842
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,159
we can put in and then ask for working

1843
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,520
group adoption is a little premature

1844
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:11,280
it would be better to leave the

1845
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,880
placeholder in the document have a

1846
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,920
reasonable discussion about the

1847
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,960
definition

1848
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,120
and then if there's agreement add text

1849
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,280
i at this point with the text in there i

1850
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,880
would be against working group adoption

1851
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,719
i mean we have to start with what we

1852
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,679
agree with not with what we don't agree

1853
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,080
with

1854
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,080
thank you

1855
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:37,520
all right uh thank you very much um

1856
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,719
clearly there's more work to be done

1857
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:43,520
on this before we move to adoption uh

1858
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:44,560
uh kieran and the authors have said that

1859
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,199
they will

1860
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:48,000
continue to discuss it on on the list i

1861
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:51,519
think that's a

1862
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:55,840
a good next step um

1863
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:58,159
uh i'll pavon and i will talk

1864
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:00,400
between ourselves as well as with yari

1865
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:04,719
of whether or not it makes sense to have

1866
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:08,239
um uh informal or a formal interim

1867
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:11,360
on just this this piece uh clearly

1868
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:13,199
um it's really important that we have

1869
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,320
agreement on what it is we're doing and

1870
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,839
fundamentally that's what we're doing

1871
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,639
with

1872
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:20,560
definitions and we do need to reach

1873
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,679
working group consensus on what it is

1874
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,800
we're doing it's not

1875
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,719
uh one one one person or one set of

1876
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,320
people don't

1877
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:29,760
dictate to the rest of the working group

1878
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,080
it's consensus and

1879
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,679
clearly we don't have it yet on at least

1880
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,199
the isolation term

1881
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,880
uh and it sounds like there's some good

1882
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:39,519
energy to

1883
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,960
help move us forward and we'd like to

1884
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,320
see where that leads us

1885
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:47,840
and again we'll um we'll talk

1886
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:51,440
with yari about what the next step is on

1887
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,760
an informal or formal meeting uh

1888
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,960
pavan anything you want to add that's

1889
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,560
one quick thing

1890
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,600
yes good yeah so that's one option but

1891
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,440
but you did have

1892
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,880
another option that you would go forward

1893
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,879
with you know let's agree that we

1894
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,640
disagree and have a placeholder and have

1895
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,239
that discussion after adoption

1896
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,560
i think the document might actually be

1897
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:12,000
adoptable if you did that

1898
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,679
well given that there's an active

1899
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,600
discussion going on

1900
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,920
it might be good to see if we can reach

1901
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:22,480
any yeah conclusions with that active

1902
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:22,480
discussion and um

1903
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,199
i was trying to leave room for that

1904
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,919
clearly if in a few weeks we don't have

1905
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:30,080
any good

1906
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,600
resolutions we can talk about where to

1907
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,440
go next

1908
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:41,840
and i agree that just putting in a

1909
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:41,839
placeholder is a viable option

1910
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,440
no i agree with that i mean we are at a

1911
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,000
stage where we need to make a call

1912
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,599
um so i think given that the discussion

1913
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:56,560
is happening and a

1914
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,239
few proposals have been made uh let's uh

1915
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,560
yeah let's discuss that i mean i

1916
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:02,159
i'm not taking the place holders thing

1917
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,040
totally out of the equation yet but yeah

1918
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,759
i mean let's

1919
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,440
uh discuss it uh over the next week or

1920
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,760
so and see if there's a need for another

1921
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,759
interrupt

1922
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:20,640
okay i think we are about 25 minutes

1923
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:23,199
late running late by 24 minutes

1924
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,960
we can if there isn't anything else on

1925
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:28,320
this topic we can

1926
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,320
jump to reza's presentation

1927
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,840
let's wait for the slides

1928
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:46,959
the topic of this uh presentation

1929
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,239
is application of uh ietf network

1930
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,400
slicing

1931
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:53,919
in 5g on behalf of my quarters i'm going

1932
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,879
to present this one

1933
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,880
next slightly

1934
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:09,120
let's try it in five minutes that's okay

1935
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:12,638
the first the draft of this presenter

1936
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:15,849
this was presented at

1937
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,960
itf 105

1938
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:21,520
[Music]

1939
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:24,880
now the main changes that happen to the

1940
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:28,239
draft is to be aligned with the

1941
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:32,320
definition of the ietf network slice

1942
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,360
exactly how it fits in 5g all the

1943
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,480
terminology

1944
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,159
everything that has been done in nsdt is

1945
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,159
reflected here

1946
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:45,599
and the content of this draft is

1947
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:47,040
it's shown here how itf network slice

1948
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,159
related to 5g

1949
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:52,000
how they are related and

1950
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:54,320
everything related to that northbound

1951
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,639
interface and details of the

1952
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:57,840
ietf network slicing is there well

1953
01:20:56,639 --> 01:21:02,320
described

1954
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,320
in the in the draft next slide

1955
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,599
as you've seen here and it is is

1956
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:10,159
basically taking that

1957
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,120
from the definition drop network slicing

1958
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,000
as a concept

1959
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:14,880
is related not only to 5g but other use

1960
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,040
cases

1961
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,920
in this trap specifically we are going

1962
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,199
to talk about

1963
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:23,840
5g network slicing how is relates and

1964
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:24,400
we try to address everything that

1965
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,880
happened

1966
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:31,839
on the nfct the how it relates to

1967
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,000
5g if you go to the next slide it's

1968
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:36,800
trying to then next to us like trying to

1969
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,159
just give a context visually how that

1970
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,280
relates that to

1971
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,000
5g the for the end-to-end network slice

1972
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,800
as a whole

1973
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,360
as you see here from the left to the

1974
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,360
right

1975
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:50,000
we have started from the ue user

1976
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,639
equipment all the way to the rand domain

1977
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,239
to transport domain and the core domain

1978
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,120
how

1979
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:59,519
various uh area alright this domain

1980
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,480
related to end-to-end network is clearly

1981
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:03,120
shown here

1982
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,678
that end-to-end network slides as a

1983
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,719
whole

1984
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:08,800
has component in the ram

1985
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,400
transport or core the portion which is

1986
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:13,199
related to our work

1987
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,159
is the yellow one that is related to itf

1988
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:16,320
network slice

1989
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:17,679
this is important to note that this

1990
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,840
picture

1991
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,040
and it's applicable to other use cases

1992
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,679
as well that

1993
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,639
that network is life is not end-to-end

1994
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,719
network slide

1995
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,440
you know this is important to understand

1996
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:30,480
that why we call it ietf network slides

1997
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,120
related

1998
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:33,839
to the end-to-end context it's important

1999
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:37,280
to

2000
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:40,159
consider this picture when we go through

2001
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,440
the rest that when we talk about iotm

2002
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:43,360
network slice

2003
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,599
is not the end-to-end context and it is

2004
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,239
very important and the pictures clearly

2005
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,800
show that

2006
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:50,080
this is only one component of end-to-end

2007
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,840
context

2008
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,840
next slide

2009
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,880
to see the same problem from the

2010
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:02,080
different angle

2011
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:05,040
as you seen here starting from bottom

2012
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:06,719
up of this picture i have different

2013
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:09,280
networks

2014
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,719
i have run network i have various

2015
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,639
transport networks

2016
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,719
and i have a core network whatever

2017
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:17,679
transport network provides

2018
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:19,840
is providing the connectivity between

2019
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,800
various components and in a specific in

2020
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,000
5g

2021
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:26,000
i try to show the component that needed

2022
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,360
to be connected because the whole idea

2023
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,760
of ietf

2024
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,880
network as like definition starts from

2025
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:34,560
the

2026
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:37,840
connection with a specific sla slash slo

2027
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,560
in the 5g in a specific the connectivity

2028
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,639
that we do

2029
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,800
we do connectivity inside the run

2030
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,040
network we are doing the connectivity

2031
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,800
between run network and core network and

2032
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,519
potentially in the core network

2033
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,080
these are various transfer slices or

2034
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,800
sorry

2035
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,159
ietf network slices which well described

2036
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,639
in the document

2037
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:59,040
why we need that depends under your rand

2038
01:23:56,639 --> 01:24:02,400
deployment there are various changes

2039
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:05,040
your values item

2040
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,799
network slice will be introduced and

2041
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,519
it's uh

2042
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,080
i also refer to the definition graph and

2043
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:13,679
picture

2044
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:17,840
that we use

2045
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:21,360
in the context of 5g next slide please

2046
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:25,520
i have two more slides the

2047
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,519
so the definition draft

2048
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,440
in this case there's a summary of the

2049
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,800
work we will

2050
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:35,919
define the itf network a slice

2051
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:39,440
use case in the 5g and in a specific

2052
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:39,920
the nbi that we need uh we discussed

2053
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:42,400
that

2054
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,600
there are potential some augmentation

2055
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:47,040
needed to be done

2056
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:49,199
in the nbi the draft there is some

2057
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,159
informational model we are still working

2058
01:24:49,199 --> 01:24:53,360
on that one

2059
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:54,239
but this is the main topic of uh this

2060
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:59,759
draft

2061
01:24:54,239 --> 01:25:02,799
and last slide we are seeking for uh

2062
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:05,360
feedback comments we

2063
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:07,360
continuously aligned this drive with

2064
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:10,480
nstt work and everything

2065
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:12,960
that uh is happening uh in the in a

2066
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:16,959
specific in the area of the

2067
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:20,719
nbi that we need and uh

2068
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:24,400
the proposed uh the draft

2069
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:28,000
and enhancement will be presented in the

2070
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:32,239
next idea there are two questions

2071
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,239
uh then please go ahead

2072
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:46,880
document and about the section three

2073
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:50,639
for 5g n2n splicing i think

2074
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:53,679
uh if the work is related to ietf

2075
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:56,239
it is primarily the splitting maybe

2076
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,520
slicing requirements and the mapping

2077
01:25:56,239 --> 01:26:02,959
uh mapping transport slice

2078
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:05,440
to other slices from

2079
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,040
different domains so i think maybe this

2080
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:10,239
part of work could

2081
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:13,679
consider to combine with

2082
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:16,320
the existing work in this working group

2083
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:18,000
i think maybe you have also read our

2084
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,639
document about the factory

2085
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,400
end-to-end network slice in my opinion i

2086
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:25,840
think it can be combined

2087
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:28,400
and what do you think

2088
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,840
uh i will take a look let's have that

2089
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,159
one on the mailing issue

2090
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:35,840
if there are some synergy between those

2091
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,839
documents for sure we can do that

2092
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,879
please send that reference on the list

2093
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,519
and yeah and rezak and and discuss it

2094
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,360
with reza

2095
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:51,840
i think we should move on to the next

2096
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:51,839
comment jimmy okay

2097
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,800
jimmy g

2098
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,880
yes can you hear me now uh i would have

2099
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:03,360
to cut the line after g

2100
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:05,679
sorry g g go ahead you go ahead

2101
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:06,719
can you hear me now get scrapped yeah

2102
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,360
good

2103
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:10,480
yeah yeah i see this draft mentioned

2104
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,480
several topics

2105
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:16,559
like the use cases in 5g nanoslides

2106
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,799
and the relationship between the itf

2107
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,920
slice and the 5g entrance device

2108
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:25,280
also it measures some dead models like

2109
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:28,880
for the not bound interface so i'm

2110
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:31,280
asking which topic will be the most

2111
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,159
important for this draft and some of

2112
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,360
this

2113
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:37,519
other part may be relatively overlapped

2114
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,400
with some work in the design team and

2115
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,719
also the northbound interface model and

2116
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,679
as

2117
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,560
she should mention uh to enter a slice

2118
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:48,400
mapping

2119
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:50,159
i draft maybe my suggestion will be

2120
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:51,440
maybe this one can focus on the use

2121
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,599
cases

2122
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,799
and for the other part can coordinate

2123
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,400
with other documents

2124
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:59,120
in the working group if i understand

2125
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,839
your question

2126
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,760
correctly so this document for the first

2127
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:07,120
two items that you mentioned

2128
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,840
that are not overlapping but rather try

2129
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,639
to

2130
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:13,600
extend the abstract definition that we

2131
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:16,239
have for ietf network applies in the 5g

2132
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:16,880
so northbound included definition on

2133
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:18,879
that

2134
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,960
and for the last item as i mentioned if

2135
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:23,679
there is synergy we can combine

2136
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,760
so i know that we don't have time to go

2137
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:28,960
through more detail but

2138
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:31,040
if there are other comments please uh

2139
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:34,080
put it in the main links and we can

2140
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:38,960
cover accordingly

2141
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:42,320
okay thank you thank you um lewis

2142
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:45,360
can you hear me there we go

2143
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:46,559
perfect okay um hello one if you can

2144
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,599
keep it to five minutes that would be

2145
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,800
great close

2146
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,800
so next slide please

2147
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,440
okay so the the motivation of this work

2148
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:02,400
of this document is

2149
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:07,440
basically um to consider the

2150
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:07,440
or i'm not sure if this is proper sorry

2151
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,199
this is for the use cases right not for

2152
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,520
the uh

2153
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,519
okay

2154
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,800
look can you shift to the other

2155
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,920
presentation or if you can do it in a

2156
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,320
different order

2157
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,159
the detail was wrong i think but i think

2158
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,120
this is the proper presentation so

2159
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,879
this is one the one about use cases yeah

2160
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:32,320
so the um

2161
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:34,560
yeah essentially here is that

2162
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,639
we we don't have yet a clear view of

2163
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,480
what could be the potential use cases in

2164
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,719
that the consuming let's say the itf

2165
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,040
network slices so

2166
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,040
the indication of this document was

2167
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:48,080
essentially go through the different

2168
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:50,480
potential use cases and start and

2169
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:51,120
try to get from them different

2170
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,320
attributes

2171
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:54,080
different procedures in order to

2172
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,559
understand what could be the behavior of

2173
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:57,760
the

2174
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,120
and expected the behavior of the no

2175
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,560
bound interface

2176
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:02,559
so next slide

2177
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,880
so we will go quickly through the

2178
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,239
different use cases already identified

2179
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,239
in this document the first one will be

2180
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:14,080
about 5g services is

2181
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:15,280
related with what the result was

2182
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,719
presented before

2183
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,320
so the objective will be essentially to

2184
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:20,639
support and to end network slices as

2185
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:24,000
defined for 5g systems

2186
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:26,480
essentially in 3gpp and

2187
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,600
regarding any node interface attributes

2188
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:30,000
we could consider as

2189
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,639
low such downlink uplink throughput or

2190
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,120
slice qos parameters for instance

2191
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,679
and plus a additional characteristics

2192
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:37,840
such a

2193
01:30:35,679 --> 01:30:39,040
group communication support support of

2194
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,080
non-ip traffic

2195
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:43,600
etc regarding procedures we could

2196
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:47,120
consider here where the procedure is

2197
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,960
defined in 3dbp for a slice flight cycle

2198
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,639
for instance inside instance allocation

2199
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,239
slices as a location the allocation

2200
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,840
modification status

2201
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:55,519
et cetera et cetera the guardian

2202
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,800
applicability of the

2203
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,960
network slice in this context

2204
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,679
essentially would be for the m3 and 9

2205
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:02,080
and 6

2206
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:03,280
interfaces in order to support the

2207
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,760
different slice

2208
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,639
types defined in 3dpp it has mobile

2209
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,800
problem

2210
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:10,800
ultra large variable low literacy and so

2211
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,840
on so far

2212
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:17,120
taking as references the dsma

2213
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:20,560
is generic slice template and the 3gpp

2214
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:24,400
spec on controlling management of slices

2215
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:25,520
next slide please an additional use case

2216
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,559
would be

2217
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,000
the nsb based services so the yeti here

2218
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:32,080
will be the support of connectivity

2219
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,120
between virtual network functions that

2220
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,320
are

2221
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,360
instantiated in remote nfbi points of

2222
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,519
presence

2223
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:40,719
regarding any mbi attributes that could

2224
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,960
be identified would be

2225
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:44,719
slos such incoming and going bank with

2226
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:46,639
qos metric etc

2227
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:48,239
and additional characteristics such as

2228
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:51,199
directionality

2229
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:52,480
sorry directionality protection scheme

2230
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:55,120
and so on so far

2231
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,440
regarding mbi procedures will be all

2232
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:58,000
related to lifecycle capacity fault and

2233
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,759
perform

2234
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,600
performance management of these

2235
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,239
multi-site connectivity services as

2236
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,120
defined by

2237
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:05,678
hcnb the applicability clearly will be

2238
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:08,000
the

2239
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:09,600
the communication between these remote

2240
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,080
and api pops

2241
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,840
in order to support the different slos

2242
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,239
that could be requested by

2243
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,199
this connectivity the reference here are

2244
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:20,320
the a couple of

2245
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:21,599
specs from hcnb the iphone 32 and the

2246
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:23,599
soul 17

2247
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,840
which specify the the respective

2248
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:29,440
behavior for these

2249
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:29,440
communications next slide please

2250
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,000
the last documented use case would be

2251
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,280
the one of run sharing here the

2252
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,960
objective would be the provision and

2253
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:39,040
connectivity between cell sites

2254
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,560
and interconnection points between

2255
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,080
operators for um

2256
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,679
essentially for delivering the traffic

2257
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,719
from the this share

2258
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:48,560
uh radio sales sites regarding

2259
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,960
mbi attributes that could be expected to

2260
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:53,120
be for sure as a low such a maximum and

2261
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,560
guaranteed rate bounded latency packet

2262
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,159
loss rate etc

2263
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:59,280
and additional characteristics such as

2264
01:32:56,159 --> 01:33:01,360
secure connection ip addressing and so

2265
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,880
respect to the mpi procedures that could

2266
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:04,559
be expected for the use case with the

2267
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,239
provision of connectivity services

2268
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,600
collection of performance and fault data

2269
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:10,480
etc

2270
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,920
applicability of the itf network lies in

2271
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,280
this context would be the multi-tenancy

2272
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,520
of mobile

2273
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:16,880
front-hall mid-hall and backhaul and the

2274
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,960
reference is this is not

2275
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:21,199
not normative but is the descriptive is

2276
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,360
the metric internet form what paper and

2277
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:26,239
from whole background shedding

2278
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,239
next slide please

2279
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,919
so this is the final one the next steps

2280
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,678
would be to complete the draft with new

2281
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:35,760
use cases we have

2282
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,040
in mind to describe evolution of

2283
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,760
wholesale services and cloud

2284
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,080
computing-based services

2285
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:44,000
regarding the document after that the

2286
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,440
idea would be to elicit common slos

2287
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,880
attributes and procedures for all the

2288
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:48,879
cases in such a way that we could

2289
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,920
document in an additional

2290
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:53,760
chapter within the draft and

2291
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,600
with respect to the group so the idea

2292
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,040
here would be the other presentation to

2293
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,080
collect feedback and comments from the

2294
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,719
working group

2295
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,280
to check if this work could be a

2296
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,679
progress

2297
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:05,199
as part of the work in the neighborhood

2298
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:07,120
licensing design team

2299
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:08,559
and for sure to prepare a new version

2300
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:12,400
for for next meeting

2301
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,400
and this is all from my side

2302
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:19,840
okay any comments

2303
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,320
we don't we don't have anybody on the

2304
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,520
queue so

2305
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,679
yeah you can go to your next

2306
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:31,360
presentation okay thank you

2307
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,360
so this presentation is about

2308
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:35,760
the idea of how is the structure in the

2309
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:38,239
itf network slice controller

2310
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:39,199
and also how to to place the different

2311
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,119
models uh

2312
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:43,759
regarding to this structure so next

2313
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:43,759
slide please

2314
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,159
so regarding the problem to to be

2315
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,760
addressed uh

2316
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,440
that the impacts on how they destruct

2317
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,560
the potential structure in terms of

2318
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,440
components of the neglect less

2319
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,960
controller

2320
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,719
is to understand that there will be two

2321
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,040
essential procedures to be performed by

2322
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,280
the

2323
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,639
uh networks less controller essentially

2324
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:03,119
the mapping of the

2325
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,320
itf negotiator requests as coming from

2326
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:06,239
the from the customer

2327
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,519
and then the realization of those those

2328
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,959
slices

2329
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,320
regarding the data models we could

2330
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:11,840
consider two different views the

2331
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:14,080
customer view which is a

2332
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,920
focus on the individual itf network

2333
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,239
slice request the customer

2334
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,840
and the provider view that essentially

2335
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,519
consider all the devices being

2336
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,639
provisioned being realized in the

2337
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,239
network so

2338
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,960
these two different views are

2339
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:28,718
complementary and necessary for

2340
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:30,080
making it work so the goal of the

2341
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:32,719
document is essentially to

2342
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:34,239
identify the major networks like

2343
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,560
controller components and how the

2344
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:38,559
associated data models apply to

2345
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,159
to these components or to the interface

2346
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:43,360
interfaces between components

2347
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:46,799
next slide please

2348
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:49,839
so uh zooming in into the

2349
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,960
a high level structure of uh that is

2350
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,560
reflected in the neighborhood slice

2351
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,480
definition document

2352
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,679
we could take this itf network slice

2353
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:59,678
controller entity

2354
01:35:55,679 --> 01:36:03,280
and trying to to say

2355
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:05,119
divide in in some your components sorry

2356
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,960
so regarding the structure we identified

2357
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:08,080
these two major components the mapper

2358
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,040
that would be the

2359
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,159
the component um in charge of processing

2360
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,239
the customer request

2361
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:16,239
and putting it in into the constant

2362
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:17,519
context of the overall itf network

2363
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:19,440
slices in the network

2364
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,440
and the realizer that would be

2365
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:24,159
essentially the one that processed the

2366
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:25,599
complete view of all the slices and

2367
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:28,400
decides the proper technologies for

2368
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,760
realizing the itm network slides

2369
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,638
below in the itf technologies used for

2370
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:34,080
that

2371
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:35,760
and regarding the models you can see in

2372
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,840
the in the picture in the middle three

2373
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,719
different

2374
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:43,760
interfaces that are labeled as a b and c

2375
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:45,199
so um the first try of

2376
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:47,600
mapping the models to the these

2377
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:48,960
interfaces we

2378
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,960
understand we would see that the

2379
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,320
customer view is covered by the

2380
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:55,360
w the t's itf network slice and bijan

2381
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:58,639
model

2382
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:00,480
the the interface label as b will be the

2383
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,400
provider review that

2384
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:04,480
could be accomplished by the leo this

2385
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,799
transport network slice junk model

2386
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:07,678
and the models in c would be essentially

2387
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,880
the ones that

2388
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:13,280
are used for going against

2389
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:14,560
all the enabled controllers below and

2390
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,759
would be out of the scope of this

2391
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:19,199
document

2392
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,960
next slide please so the next

2393
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,879
step would be to solve some open points

2394
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,600
that our signal has to do

2395
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:27,679
items in the into the document uh we

2396
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,760
have identified two so far so

2397
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,600
one would be the breakdown of ns mapper

2398
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:34,159
and ns realizer as

2399
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,280
these major components that we do for c

2400
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:36,879
the second one to this

2401
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,719
would be to discuss the complementarity

2402
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,480
of the formation models

2403
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,719
for satisfying type one and type two

2404
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:45,919
services as per act

2405
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:48,400
rfc so the point here is that we need to

2406
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:51,679
discuss uh to understand

2407
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,360
the model label as b

2408
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:56,560
could also accomplish on customer

2409
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:58,000
request as customer slice request

2410
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:59,600
then to collect feedback and comments

2411
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,920
from the working group for sure to

2412
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:05,360
propose a draft as a grid

2413
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:08,400
sorry as a great outcome of the ts

2414
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:10,000
uh neighbors like design team uh

2415
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,159
by the way the all the co-authors of

2416
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,400
this document are co-authors of the two

2417
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:16,799
proposed models so there is

2418
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,638
a concept on that and then to prepare a

2419
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:22,080
new version for next meeting

2420
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:25,360
and that's all from my side we have

2421
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:27,119
adrian in the queue uh adrian yeah

2422
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:29,679
thanks uh thanks luis

2423
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:30,719
for this document i think it's useful to

2424
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:34,000
pull

2425
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:36,880
um things together the way you've done

2426
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,280
uh can i ask you beg you to go and look

2427
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,800
at

2428
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:44,480
rsc 8309 which is the

2429
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:48,080
ops area working group um

2430
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:51,519
view um of how

2431
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:55,199
young models are composed to provide a

2432
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:58,400
top to bottom uh delivery of a

2433
01:38:55,199 --> 01:39:00,080
service and maybe map to that or use

2434
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,119
some of that terminology

2435
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:05,360
to be consistent uh with what the ietf

2436
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:08,480
has already done

2437
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,759
for sure i i we will proceed on that way

2438
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,239
thank you

2439
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:14,320
thanks i'll drop that to the list thank

2440
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:19,040
you

2441
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:19,040
okay uh boris can you keep it short

2442
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:23,759
yeah okay so i will try lewis very short

2443
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:25,920
question

2444
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,199
could you mention what network

2445
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:30,159
controller could be

2446
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:31,519
optional because in some cases network

2447
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:34,400
nsc

2448
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,880
will be more than enough uh to provision

2449
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,040
it so

2450
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,239
network controller could be like

2451
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:42,480
optional in

2452
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:42,480
in several cases in my opinion

2453
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,800
so uh do you refer to the the ones at

2454
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,440
the bottom

2455
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:53,119
right totally the bottom we are selling

2456
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,040
two years

2457
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:56,239
the high-level architecture that was in

2458
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,679
definitions

2459
01:39:56,239 --> 01:39:59,759
maybe this is something that we could

2460
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:02,000
also address so maybe we can add a

2461
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:05,280
discussion topic i think

2462
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,679
okay thank you thank you okay bo

2463
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,840
you're up next yeah okay okay can you

2464
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:13,040
hear me

2465
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:16,639
yeah uh i'm here to present uh

2466
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:19,760
for the iep network slice

2467
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:24,320
uh northbound interface yeah model

2468
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,320
uh next slide please

2469
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:35,760
uh luis just mentioned that

2470
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:39,119
uh there could be multiple

2471
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:43,040
net itf network slice related model

2472
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:47,839
uh to be like implemented in

2473
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:47,840
in four different uh for different

2474
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:54,320
networks like controller and this draft

2475
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:58,239
is the goal of this draft is to define

2476
01:40:54,320 --> 01:41:02,320
a northbound interface young model and

2477
01:40:58,239 --> 01:41:05,440
since the

2478
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:08,000
the terminology has been changed for the

2479
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,519
for for the network slides so this draft

2480
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,679
has been changed

2481
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,800
so you can notice the name has changed

2482
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,280
uh because uh

2483
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:16,320
we have been this proposed for

2484
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:19,440
discussion in

2485
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:22,080
in the working group and also a network

2486
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:24,719
slice design team for several times

2487
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:26,239
so and this young model is quite

2488
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,360
consistent

2489
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:29,759
with the ietf network slice definition

2490
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,400
drop

2491
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,600
so this is the reason why we changed the

2492
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:37,360
name

2493
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:40,960
and and we also uh

2494
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:45,920
received some comment about uh how

2495
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:47,840
our uh how this mbi model to work with

2496
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:51,920
the relationship with other

2497
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:55,679
young model so here's we give the

2498
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:59,679
uh some explanation about things

2499
01:41:55,679 --> 01:42:02,639
itf has a classified ser

2500
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:03,520
young modules into different categories

2501
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,920
and

2502
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,880
like there could be service model and

2503
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,400
network model

2504
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:14,239
and also the device model so the mbi

2505
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:18,000
the this ietf network slice and bi model

2506
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:20,799
falls into the category of service model

2507
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,560
uh also lewis mentioned this is from the

2508
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:26,000
consumer view

2509
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:27,360
and this model maybe will work together

2510
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:30,800
with other

2511
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:34,320
layers model to integ to be integrated

2512
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,280
together to fulfillment uh the ietf

2513
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:37,119
network slice

2514
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,400
service and network management

2515
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:43,839
coordination

2516
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:43,839
so next slide please

2517
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:51,440
uh chair

2518
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,440
yes okay

2519
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:58,239
based on the the discussion of ietf

2520
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:02,080
network slice definition

2521
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:06,879
mbi young model should fill the

2522
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:09,840
the requirements that this model should

2523
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,920
work not only for the configuration but

2524
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:15,920
also for the monetary so

2525
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:19,199
when modeling this model we think uh

2526
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:22,400
uh the young model should fail uh these

2527
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:26,799
requirements and uh

2528
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:30,400
this young model like uh borrow uh

2529
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,520
the definition from itf network slice

2530
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,559
definition draft

2531
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:38,000
uh like the ietf uh

2532
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:41,199
the left-hand side is the view from the

2533
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:44,639
slice definition draft it's a view from

2534
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:48,400
a much higher level and there could be

2535
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:51,440
a one itf network slice

2536
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:55,119
they will be related

2537
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:56,559
to different nse that's natural slice

2538
01:43:55,119 --> 01:43:59,679
endpoints

2539
01:43:56,560 --> 01:44:03,119
so in our modeling we also

2540
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:06,800
use this terminology

2541
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:10,000
and we expand to two more details

2542
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:13,040
so i just gave some uh

2543
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:16,159
high level design uh consideration about

2544
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:19,600
uh the network slice connection group

2545
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:20,960
because uh some of our authors think

2546
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:24,080
there could be

2547
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,199
use cases that in one ietf network

2548
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:28,719
slides could be

2549
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:29,599
multiple different uh slo requirements

2550
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:33,600
for different

2551
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,960
network slice members members means that

2552
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,880
a

2553
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,880
a pair of network slice endpoints

2554
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:42,400
connections so

2555
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,440
we created this new uh concept in in the

2556
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,960
modeling

2557
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:50,320
and also we think we need to create

2558
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:50,320
a network slice member

2559
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:58,080
concept to to for the for the monetary

2560
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:01,280
uh modeling so here

2561
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:03,600
that's a the modeling thinking

2562
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:05,360
and can we skip to the next steps i'm

2563
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:08,080
sorry we're really tired yeah yes

2564
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,480
yeah yeah okay uh then we finished this

2565
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:11,519
part

2566
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:15,440
and uh our consideration

2567
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:17,679
is we would like to uh seek more

2568
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,799
comments from the working group and and

2569
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:21,440
more input

2570
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,480
for the designing uh modeling designing

2571
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,678
so

2572
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:31,839
that's all for these slides thank you

2573
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:31,840
thank you

2574
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,678
run

2575
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:46,159
you're you're muted

2576
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,880
run good

2577
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:59,840
there is a unmute button at the top

2578
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,839
the mic symbol

2579
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:13,840
and can you hear us

2580
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:22,159
uh ran if you would mind just typing in

2581
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:22,719
jabber when you think you have it

2582
01:46:22,159 --> 01:46:25,839
working

2583
01:46:22,719 --> 01:46:28,159
and we will go to tariq and tariq just

2584
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:31,520
because of the time if you can do

2585
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:31,519
your first one in five minutes

2586
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,199
can you hear me yes yeah yep great

2587
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:45,759
thank you uh hi and my name is tariq

2588
01:46:43,199 --> 01:46:46,559
i'm one of the authors and the topic is

2589
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,760
uh

2590
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:52,000
realizing network slices slices in ipm

2591
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:55,840
plus networks

2592
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,840
uh next slide please

2593
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,000
next slide

2594
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:08,159
can you hear me oh okay

2595
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:10,480
so a quick overview of the agenda uh

2596
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:12,239
i'll cruise over the introduction with

2597
01:47:10,480 --> 01:47:14,718
whatever time i can

2598
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:16,799
crunch in uh i want to talk about the

2599
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,960
slice per hop definition

2600
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,840
and how it facilitates the creation of

2601
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:23,520
the slice

2602
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:25,920
and um see if i can

2603
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,440
go over the multiple approaches to

2604
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:29,119
network slicing

2605
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,519
that we have in the draft and then that

2606
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:34,320
close off with the next steps

2607
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,320
next slide please

2608
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:40,239
so the solution we adopt is uh based on

2609
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,280
the diffserv principles for network

2610
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:43,440
slicing

2611
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,559
the network resources the shared network

2612
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:46,960
resources

2613
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,639
and to ensure the proper placement of

2614
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:52,000
the of the path

2615
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:54,239
and getting the traffic treatment for uh

2616
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,440
for sliced traffic uh when it's

2617
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:58,480
traversing the

2618
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,559
shared network resources um

2619
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:02,400
the solution we're proposing is agnostic

2620
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,119
to the path control technique

2621
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,599
used to set up the path in the slice

2622
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:08,639
domain

2623
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:12,719
be it sr rsvp or others

2624
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:14,800
it it it takes into account that

2625
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,760
slices will have to be created

2626
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:19,280
dynamically

2627
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:23,520
and changed managed dynamically

2628
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:26,480
and on demand and

2629
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,760
yeah we we we have consideration for uh

2630
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:30,159
different types of traffic

2631
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:31,679
carried over the same slice and for that

2632
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:34,480
we rely on the

2633
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:36,320
diffserv class selector field in the

2634
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:40,879
different data plane

2635
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:42,960
technologies next slide please

2636
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:44,800
so there are three approaches to the

2637
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:48,080
solution that

2638
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:51,440
to realize network slicing one is

2639
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:53,600
a control clean only uh slicing of the

2640
01:48:51,440 --> 01:48:55,839
network resources the second is a data

2641
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,880
plane only slicing of the network

2642
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:00,239
resources

2643
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,480
and the third is the combination of

2644
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:03,839
control plane and data plane slicing of

2645
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:07,119
the resources

2646
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:10,159
um in in in our solution we

2647
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:13,679
as i mentioned we we introduced this

2648
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:16,719
slice per hop definition this definition

2649
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:19,920
encompasses a data plane size selector

2650
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:23,599
a uh a set of parameters for the

2651
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:27,199
data plane resources uh a qs profile

2652
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:31,040
the perhaps behaviors of

2653
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:32,799
related to the slice as well it

2654
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:35,519
encompasses a set of control cleaning

2655
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,760
resources associated with the slice

2656
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,760
with respect to reservable bandwidth

2657
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:42,639
priorities

2658
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,440
of reservation and the control plane and

2659
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:46,639
any

2660
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:48,559
shared resource groups that

2661
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:50,080
you know this slice is willing to share

2662
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:52,480
resources with

2663
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:54,639
and the last piece of information that

2664
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:56,400
the slice per hub definition

2665
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,080
will contain is a reference to a

2666
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:59,920
topology that

2667
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:02,320
defines the links and nodes that this

2668
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,320
slice

2669
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:09,360
that belongs to this slice there are

2670
01:50:07,040 --> 01:50:11,760
multiple ways that to disseminate this

2671
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:13,920
slice per hop definition that we looked

2672
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:17,360
into one of them is

2673
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:21,040
is a suitable netcom for grpc

2674
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:24,000
interface once we have laid down the

2675
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:26,000
the data model the other approach is

2676
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,440
disseminating this or exchanging this in

2677
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,560
a routing protocol

2678
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:32,799
like igp or bgp and the last uh

2679
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:35,360
is the manual configuration of the of

2680
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:39,840
the definition

2681
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:39,839
next slide please

2682
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:44,480
we are on slide four

2683
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,960
i'm sorry i can't hear you uh can you

2684
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,000
wrap up

2685
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:00,800
so we have some time for indeed

2686
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,040
okay all right so the the hub definition

2687
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,440
i mentioned that contains the slice

2688
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:07,679
data plane slice selector it's it's a

2689
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:10,000
field that is carried in the packets

2690
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,840
there are multiple variations for this

2691
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,400
uh i'll leave you to

2692
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,679
go over the multiple options and where

2693
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:18,080
uh one

2694
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,159
is more suitable for different uh use

2695
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:24,080
cases or deployments

2696
01:51:20,159 --> 01:51:27,360
we mentioned that there is a qs profile

2697
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:30,400
associated with a slice can we

2698
01:51:27,360 --> 01:51:32,639
move on to the next slide please

2699
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:33,519
and as well the control plane resource

2700
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,400
management

2701
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,960
the different parameters associated with

2702
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:40,159
it

2703
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:41,119
lastly the topology uh that defines the

2704
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:44,480
links and nodes

2705
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:44,799
associated with the slice so these are

2706
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:48,239
the

2707
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:50,800
pieces there are three slides and

2708
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:52,480
subsequent slides here that define

2709
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,840
different approaches to network slicing

2710
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:58,879
the first one is

2711
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,880
the data plane only slicing um

2712
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:03,599
in in that one there's no network state

2713
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:06,320
maintained in the control plane

2714
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:07,280
the second one is the control plane only

2715
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:10,159
slicing

2716
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:11,119
of the network resources and in here we

2717
01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:13,440
have

2718
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,799
the resources in the control thing being

2719
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:17,440
sliced

2720
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,880
without consideration um or without the

2721
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:21,598
data plane being uh

2722
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,040
knowledgeable about slices uh and the

2723
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,199
last one

2724
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:26,400
um the last one is the combination of

2725
01:52:25,199 --> 01:52:28,480
the two of the

2726
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:30,559
of the previous two we think that the

2727
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:33,119
last one will give us the

2728
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:35,280
strict guarantees that we're looking for

2729
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:39,119
uh at least we're trying to standardize

2730
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:40,880
in ietf um unfortunately i don't i

2731
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:41,440
didn't i don't have much time but okay

2732
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,599
so for

2733
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:48,400
in terms of next steps we are going to

2734
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,320
coordinate with a number of drafts that

2735
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:52,480
are already

2736
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:54,000
out there with respect to prodigal

2737
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:58,080
extensions

2738
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,760
for slice aware traffic engineering

2739
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,119
we do request the working group to

2740
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,280
review the document

2741
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:04,159
and give us feedback and we appreciate

2742
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:07,040
that

2743
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:08,719
um i don't know how much time do i have

2744
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,840
i have another set of slides that

2745
01:53:08,719 --> 01:53:13,840
describe the

2746
01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:13,840
slideshow

2747
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:27,839
are you available uh you were going to

2748
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,840
try a different account

2749
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:45,760
ran are you out there hi

2750
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:48,639
hello yes i'm sorry yes hi

2751
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,639
five minutes please

2752
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:54,080
amazon from zte okay i will quickly

2753
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,360
i will do the prioritizing with the

2754
01:53:54,080 --> 01:54:00,080
packing network selecting using segments

2755
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:00,080
next place

2756
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:07,119
yeah a unified administrative instance

2757
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,679
identifier ai is used to distinguish

2758
01:54:07,119 --> 01:54:12,639
different virtual network resources for

2759
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:13,440
both interdomain and into domain network

2760
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:16,239
slices

2761
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:18,000
scenario now let's look at the ai from

2762
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:21,440
the following six items

2763
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,520
the first is identifier of the dedicated

2764
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:25,759
virtual network for the slides

2765
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,719
the second is it supports end-to-end

2766
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:29,760
slicing

2767
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,880
and the third is advised unified lsi

2768
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:33,840
across

2769
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:36,800
multi-domain of transport network the

2770
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:39,199
forces area is one of the constant

2771
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:40,400
criteria of the color template and the

2772
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:42,879
color template

2773
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,759
template with ai provides a more

2774
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:47,040
flexible

2775
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:50,719
control the fifth is the uniform

2776
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:51,840
color template for all overlaid uh

2777
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:55,040
service mapping

2778
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:56,800
to analyze results the sixth is uh its

2779
01:54:55,040 --> 01:55:00,159
ai meets the link

2780
01:54:56,800 --> 01:55:03,199
uh required requirements from 3gpp

2781
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:06,799
it is independent of the exerting

2782
01:55:03,199 --> 01:55:10,638
uh domain partitions of the network

2783
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:14,000
and it is also the independent of the

2784
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:17,119
exiting and the lay frame and all

2785
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,080
voting technologies there is no

2786
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:21,040
modification

2787
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:24,800
to the forwarding tables except close uh

2788
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:27,440
policy process next please

2789
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:29,920
there there is an example of our

2790
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:32,719
solutions in fact there are two tablets

2791
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,719
uh red and blue the red bullets include

2792
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:37,199
node h one two three four e

2793
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:39,360
and link between one one two one three

2794
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:41,598
one four three four and the fourier the

2795
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,400
blue topology include node eight one two

2796
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:44,719
three four e

2797
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:46,159
and link between x three three four

2798
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,719
three one one two

2799
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:49,519
uh three two four two and two e let's

2800
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:52,800
see the

2801
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:55,679
process of creating the uh slice

2802
01:55:52,800 --> 01:55:56,400
the first select the ai to the slice and

2803
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:58,960
the second

2804
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:02,000
allocates resources to the ai the third

2805
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:04,400
is ai information is advertised

2806
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,360
uh draw control place the control at the

2807
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:08,320
controller connect

2808
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:09,679
the resource information with ai through

2809
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:11,280
bdpr is

2810
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:13,599
then the controller can build the

2811
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,239
corresponding

2812
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:18,080
and they can calculate different paths

2813
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:19,759
according to the color with ai

2814
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:24,159
information in its

2815
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:24,159
virtual network next place

2816
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:32,480
next next please

2817
01:56:29,199 --> 01:56:34,320
yes uh here as a set of tn's last

2818
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:36,799
resources identifiers

2819
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,080
our solutions to both soft and hard

2820
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,360
isolations

2821
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:44,239
for l3 interface less obsolescence

2822
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:45,280
in igp domain is numbered or unnumbered

2823
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:47,440
l3

2824
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,320
link could be configured with ai

2825
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:52,719
information

2826
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:56,239
under synchronized among idp numbers

2827
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:58,639
the idp link state page database will

2828
01:56:56,239 --> 01:57:00,959
contain out three links with ai

2829
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:02,159
information to support a t-pass

2830
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,159
computations

2831
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:06,638
uh ticker account take account of ai

2832
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:08,960
criterias

2833
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:10,800
each out three link could be configured

2834
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:14,400
to belong to a single ai

2835
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,760
or multiple ais for l2 interface slice

2836
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:19,199
isolation

2837
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:21,920
each l2 member link of our three

2838
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,799
parent links destined to be config to

2839
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,159
belong to

2840
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,199
a single ai at different l2 members link

2841
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:30,559
will have different

2842
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:31,759
single ai configuration with different

2843
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,560
agency sets

2844
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:35,280
how to number could be any type

2845
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,719
interface

2846
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:42,080
such as internet we like interface

2847
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:43,679
flexi channels t-pass computations based

2848
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:47,920
on link state

2849
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,920
database okay need

2850
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,760
sorry next next place next slide

2851
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,960
yes this is a multiple domain deployment

2852
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:03,280
it is easy to provide into in

2853
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,199
which network including the inter domain

2854
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:09,759
is some deployment

2855
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:12,239
adopt pplu for setup set up the bdpr usp

2856
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:15,199
and only service will directly over the

2857
01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:15,919
bpr usp if the only service have the

2858
01:58:15,199 --> 01:58:18,960
requirement

2859
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:21,679
of the te which defined as the color

2860
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,520
the bdplu will also support the color

2861
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:26,719
the pplu labels will

2862
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:27,040
allocated pro color the below is option

2863
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,360
b

2864
01:58:27,040 --> 01:58:30,480
in the domain it can also provide

2865
01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:33,360
end-to-end

2866
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:34,480
visual network including the inter

2867
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:36,719
domain link

2868
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:39,199
the intro domain link can also choose

2869
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:42,719
the link based on the color with ai

2870
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:46,159
next place uh

2871
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:47,440
it's the an end-to-end srt with sdn the

2872
01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:49,759
pdprs will

2873
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,280
be used to inform the topology

2874
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:53,599
information's contained

2875
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:56,000
the ai to the control controller the

2876
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,840
controller can calculate the sr path

2877
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,800
based on the information for the enter

2878
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:02,000
domain link

2879
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:04,440
btpis can advertise the direct protocol

2880
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,119
type or firstly put in the domain

2881
01:59:04,440 --> 01:59:10,080
interconnections to idp instance

2882
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:10,639
then always important import the data

2883
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:17,360
date

2884
01:59:10,639 --> 01:59:19,679
from idp protocol source next please

2885
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:20,960
yes this is combined with sr flex

2886
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:24,159
algorithm

2887
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:26,639
uh there are two scenarios

2888
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:28,480
for inter-domain case sdn controller

2889
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:31,520
concrete we n for air

2890
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:35,678
is ais based on ai and

2891
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:39,040
we aim for fa ais based on

2892
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:41,199
respectively sdn controller computers

2893

end to end segment relates to its

2894
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:45,040
contains multiple es and based on

2895
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:48,239
different topologies

2896
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:51,360

[Music]

2902
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:11,679
yes this draft also will resist

2903
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:15,519
retest some standard ar values to

2904
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:18,800
represent different types of ai like

2905
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:21,840
normal urlc and

2906
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:25,520
t next please

2907
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:30,000
and for the indulgence of us

2908

let's type e-m-b-b i'm iot we 2x will be

2909
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:34,320
uh to be defined and will be defined in

2910
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:38,839
future

2911
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:41,840
yes next please comments welcome

2912
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:41,840
thanks

2913
02:00:52,840 --> 02:00:57,199
okay

2914
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:59,040
loose uh yeah can you uh introduce your

2915
02:00:57,199 --> 02:01:01,598
draft in a minute or two and

2916
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,239
yes can you go directly to slice three i

2917
02:01:01,599 --> 02:01:05,520
i will do

2918
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:09,040
on top of that slide number here

2919
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:11,040
scenario so yeah um basically in the

2920
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:12,800
in this route what we are trying to

2921
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:13,840
address is the situation that uh now

2922
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:16,159
operators are

2923
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:17,599
starting to deploy computing facilities

2924
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:19,440
there is a wide deployment of

2925
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:21,760
different sizes a different number of

2926
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:22,000
resources so the idea would be to to

2927
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:23,920
have

2928
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,080
a joint topological view of both the

2929
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:28,080
working and computing resources

2930
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:29,840
such a way that we could take better

2931
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:31,599
decisions

2932
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:32,880
immediate decisions taking into account

2933
02:01:31,599 --> 02:01:34,639
also the

2934
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,000
the compute domain not only the network

2935
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:37,840
domain but the compute domain

2936
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,440
so somehow this is similar approach that

2937
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,639
as the one following the

2938
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:43,360
drive uh itfts service on our topology

2939
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:46,239
model

2940
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:47,360
so it is even is a an original piece of

2941
02:01:46,239 --> 02:01:50,559
work of that draft that

2942
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:52,960
has taken its proper life

2943
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:53,599
so in the pictures scenario essentially

2944
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:56,239
you can see

2945
02:01:53,599 --> 02:01:57,119
there are the different data center pops

2946
02:01:56,239 --> 02:01:58,879
with different

2947
02:01:57,119 --> 02:02:00,080
resources and the idea would be to

2948
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,040
incorporate the description of those

2949
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:04,080
resources into

2950
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:05,519
into a model augmenting the the te model

2951
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,360
uh these resources could be raw

2952
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,080
resources cpu memory storage

2953
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:11,199
or being described in terms of quotas or

2954
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:14,320
or bundles

2955
02:02:11,199 --> 02:02:15,759
uh and we drop either an example like in

2956
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:19,360
the cmtt

2957
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:20,719
so essentially what we expect is to

2958
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:22,719
adapt the model to different ways of

2959
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:24,880
exposing data center capabilities

2960
02:02:22,719 --> 02:02:25,920
working on the young modules combining

2961
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,599
such model and

2962
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,360
i'm for sure to receive any feedback or

2963
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:30,080
comment that could come from the working

2964
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:33,839
group

2965
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:33,840
on this and that's all from my side

2966
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,759
thanks lewis

2967
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:46,639
thank you very much for do the quick

2968
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:49,040
summary

2969
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,000
um apologize about the interruption in

2970
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:52,000
the middle which

2971
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,760
squeezed that already tight meeting uh

2972
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,159
closer

2973
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:58,320
please stay tuned to the list

2974
02:02:56,159 --> 02:03:01,679
participate in the list discussion

2975
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:04,799
and look uh there's we have uh look for

2976
02:03:01,679 --> 02:03:06,719
uh both the formal and informal meetings

2977
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,719
that happen regularly we remind everyone

2978
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:09,520
that the informal meetings are open to

2979
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,040
all

2980
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:15,360
uh and your contribution is most welcome

2981
02:03:13,040 --> 02:03:16,159
thank you all so much in participating

2982
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,440
in this active

2983
02:03:16,159 --> 02:03:21,280
meeting and we look forward to um

2984
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:22,480
resolving some of the open discussions

2985
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:26,880
and moving forward with

2986
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:30,239
uh adoption with uh

2987
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:31,040
the design team uh documents once we

2988
02:03:30,239 --> 02:03:33,360
seem to have

2989
02:03:31,040 --> 02:03:34,960
some better agreement on the terminology

2990
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:37,440
uh again thank you all

2991
02:03:34,960 --> 02:03:39,520
and really appreciate the contribution

2992
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:43,839
and hard work

2993
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,840
thanks everyone yeah we'll see you soon

2994
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:25,840
okay

2995
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:53,040
uh
