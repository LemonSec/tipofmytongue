1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
this

2
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
uh

3
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,079
okay marjorie can you help me

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,320
uh yes i hear you okay i guess it's

5
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,960
time to start okay so

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,158
uh welcome everyone uh i can see there's

7
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,919
22 people

8
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:23,119
on the uh the meet techo

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
uh it is uh 2 31 a.m in montreal canada

10
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,040
and i can tell you guys that the last

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,399
time i was up with such a nice a large

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,520
number of people

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,680
at 2 30 in the morning i had been

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,920
invited to the cast party

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,960
of a theater play and actually we had

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
that she's

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
started going out at midnight so um

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,360
hopefully

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,520
this is going to be as entertaining as

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
going out with the cast of the whole

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
play

22
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,759
but um um

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,000
and i will not put my video i'm

24
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
currently in my bedroom

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,479
and i don't want to put too many lights

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,600
outside also you know on because

27
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,280
eventually i'll go back to bed okay uh

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,878
welcome to uh this meeting a virtual

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,878
meeting of coding for efficient network

30
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,879
communications

31
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,520
and this is our

32
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
irtf research group

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,160
obviously your goal is to

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
and has been for quite a number of years

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,520
now foster research

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,079
in network and application layer coding

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,720
uh to improve network performance uh

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
we've done

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,319
a lot of work in this group in the past

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,440
years we've done

41
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,280
codes obviously in coding libraries but

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,680
actually i would say so we actually have

43
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,200
developed codes and codes libraries but

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,040
i would say most

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,839
also important was to the

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,799
the goal of the team was to develop

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
protocols

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
actually to facilitate the use of coding

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,518
an existing system

50
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
we wanted to have real world use cases

51
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
and work in progress

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,480
and i think it's important to highlight

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,440
that this is all in the context of

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
research

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,760
so even the protocols and the real world

56
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
and the coding we wanted to foster

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,518
research

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,079
in that not just develop codes for for

59
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480
um

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
you know the sake of developing code so

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,599
there was just

62
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,879
looking at what the re what the research

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,679
in this area was

64
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,518
uh targeting what were some of the

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,760
problems that this research was

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
uh going to address and how the

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
protocols

68
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
and and the use cases were showing that

69
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,839
that research was

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,879
uh working or it was actually delivering

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,640
outcomes that had been planned for it

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,359
next slide

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
uh so this is obviously the intellectual

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,680
property

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,239
um that we just went really fast with

76
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
now this

77
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
is the privacy and well i know we can

78
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,119
you know already knows that you have to

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
declare your

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,040
your uh your ipr we've had we've had

81
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
quite a um

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
quite quite a ride in this group about

83
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
that too

84
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,879
uh so next one next slide um

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
a vessel uh privacy in the code of

86
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,079
conduct

87
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,199
we obviously need to to behave

88
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,360
uh again very important i think

89
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
is the goal of the irtf we're not a

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,040
standardization group

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,919
we are like i said fostering research

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,759
and even when we say like i said we

93
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,719
develop that we develop codes and we

94
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,720
develop

95
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
protocols and things it's all in the

96
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,160
context of the research around this not

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
again in the context of developing a

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
standard

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,400
and i think for many people it is still

100
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,679
um a struggle because

101
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,198
you know people think oh yeah we're

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
going to take it to the iotf it's like

103
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,759
if we're taking it to the ietf or

104
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,080
to another standard organization but

105
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
it's not the case this is research and i

106
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
think

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
you're going to see today uh the

108
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,960
presentations

109
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,160
is it today yet yes it is today it's not

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
tonight it's today

111
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,199
sorry um yes give me just a few seconds

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,759
to adapt myself

113
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
um so uh where you're going to see that

114
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,720
what we're presenting today

115
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
is about research next slide

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,600
so uh we like everybody like uh

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,160
in the irtf uh we have a presence

118
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,479
on the ietf in that case data tracker

119
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
and so you can find our charter there

120
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,880
the documents uh

121
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,639
also uh all the the slides of previous

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,000
meetings and stuff

123
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,039
uh we have a github that um

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,680
vain uses uh she to post material

125
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,520
and actually to post some of the results

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,800
of hackathons that we've had

127
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,120
and other documentation obviously

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,160
for you guys who are in this meeting you

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,919
are aware

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,240
of um of the mailing list i see now that

131
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,758
we're 25 which is great i wonder how

132
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
many of you are on the

133
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,600
east coast east coast of canada and the

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,198
united states

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,479
um actually even in california it's 11

136
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,199
30 it almost makes sense um

137
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,719
so the materials are on the again the

138
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,160
data tracker

139
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,800
um and uh and on the github

140
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000
uh repository and again if you go on the

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,639
ietf

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,479
uh meeting you're going to see that uh

143
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,680
the session is being recorded

144
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,199
and it's going to be uh uploaded to the

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,319
um ietf

146
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,360
109 youtube channel

147
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,880
uh we have a bluetooth automatically

148
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
filled for those of you who never

149
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,400
attended an ietf meeting and please

150
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
sheet is stuff that goes around the

151
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
meeting

152
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,479
to uh see who is participating

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,960
uh if you want to read to join

154
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,840
um it the q manage the queue for

155
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
questions

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,440
please press the raise hand icon uh

157
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,719
and you're going to join the queue and

158
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,919
vase and i

159
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,039
are going to monitor the queue

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,758
our agenda is kind of simple uh

161
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
this is me now doing the administrivia

162
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
uh

163
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,280
we're going to have a presentation of

164
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
the bats coding scheme this is something

165
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
that is

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
really advanced and is reminded

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,479
um i'm not totally sure about the bat's

168
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
presentation because i

169
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,479
didn't receive any slides from raymond i

170
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,639
don't see raymond in the

171
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,680
but sometimes i don't know what will

172
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
happen

173
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,479
okay well i think they had also said

174
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,599
that maybe they would skip the

175
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,199
the meeting in the last few days so i

176
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,479
wasn't sure if they were going to change

177
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,919
their mind so

178
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,159
if they're not there maybe that means

179
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,758
that we do not have a bats coding scheme

180
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,919
presentation

181
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
and where they're going to rejoin us at

182
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,359
the next

183
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,800
ietf but maybe we want to

184
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,000
say something about the bats

185
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,280
draft ourselves where it is in terms of

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,120
um id um and becoming a

187
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,359
research group item so maybe we could

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,000
just say that for a few seconds

189
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,800
you could talk about that nicer uh we're

190
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,879
going to have

191
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
a present we're going to have a

192
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
presentation

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,399
on coding and congestion control

194
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,519
uh which has been an issue uh since uh

195
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,519
coding um usually hides

196
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:45,120
lost packets or also used to

197
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,959
signal congestion and morton

198
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,440
um who um is going to present us repair

199
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,560
patterns for sliding window codes

200
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
and morton we i saw your message about

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,760
being at home with young kids

202
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,760
and i really send my best next

203
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,360
okay so maybe i can uh take over you can

204
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,199
pick up you can pick up from there

205
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,000
yes yes yes thank you uh thank you

206
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,519
uh so a few words about the current

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,560
status of this

208
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,160
group and the working items so

209
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,920
we are approaching the end concerning

210
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,079
the first

211
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,360
id that were calling for satellite

212
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,480
systems

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,240
uh it passed isg review

214
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,160
uh recently it has been updated based on

215
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,519
one comment one final comment we

216
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,040
received from

217
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,399
isg review and

218
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,920
well now the the floor in the end

219
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,360
of colleen perkins to have a final uh

220
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,479
review of this uh quick update uh

221
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,160
so it will hopefully be published by

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,040
next uh itf meeting otherwise we

223
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
launched to

224
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
hopefully be published a lot earlier

225
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,680
than that

226
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,680
yes you want to say something

227
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,000
i was just saying it will hopefully be

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,839
published a lot earlier than the next

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,839
atf meeting

230
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,079
what's up yeah okay so otherwise

231
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,800
uh the we we started two uh calls

232
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,800
uh in september one for the network

233
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,479
coding for ccn and dn requirements and

234
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,519
challenges internet drafts and the other

235
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,560
one for the bats

236
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,360
uh coding scheme so the first uh call

237
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,279
was about

238
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,640
uh was the research group last call

239
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,519
which was copied also to the icnrg

240
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,279
mailing list since it is a document that

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,600
is shared between the two

242
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,600
groups

243
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,079
we didn't receive any feedback from the

244
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,320
from either

245
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:07,839
groups i sent a quick review yesterday

246
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:11,360
about it uh from my opinion

247
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,720
uh well the document is uh in good state

248
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,880
so there are a few

249
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
changes to be done but nothing really

250
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,360
serious

251
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
from my point of view so this is

252
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
something that we need to confirm of

253
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,439
course with the ic energy

254
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,640
chairs and group but i think we have

255
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,200
something which is quite solid right now

256
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
and next step if everybody agrees will

257
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,519
be to to move it to the

258
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,880
isg for rev to continue the process

259
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,399
so that's the situation for this first

260
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,519
document and also document the bats

261
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,160
the question that was raised during the

262
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
call on

263
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,319
september was all about research group

264
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,680
adoption of this document

265
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,240
so we received two

266
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
messages one from colleen and the other

267
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,160
one from

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,519
emmanuel their

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,040
comment was essentially to say that okay

270
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,079
it's a good document but

271
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,120
probably more on the standardization

272
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:18,479
aspect and less the research one

273
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,760
so this is the feedback that was sent

274
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,480
back to the authors and the authors

275
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,760
updated the document quite recently

276
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,120
yesterday

277
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,160
so we need to decide what to do if we

278
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,040
agree to have it be a

279
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,199
result group item document but that's

280
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,760
something that we can discuss

281
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,560
later on i don't know if any of the

282
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,920
authors

283
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,119
joined right now

284
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,240
i'm still waiting for raymond but seems

285
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,040
not to be here

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,560
so i suggest we discuss this at the end

287
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,040
of the meeting i don't know if

288
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,199
in the meantime raymond will be able to

289
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,399
join and do the presentation about the

290
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,399
bats new version of the the new version

291
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,120
of the bats document or not

292
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,240
but let's uh postpone it a little bit

293
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,399
this discussion a little bit

294
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,399
uh next sorry

295
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,519
uh so otherwise we have this

296
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,920
document and coding and conjecture

297
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,200
control in transport

298
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,560
good work that is making a lot of

299
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
progress

300
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,239
there will be a presentation from nicola

301
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,360
on the topic so

302
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,360
we will see then what's what uh

303
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
the the the updates that have been made

304
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,720
in this document on this work

305
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,040
and we still have two uh

306
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
items in standby mode i would say one

307
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,399
for the coding for quick and the other

308
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,279
one about tetris

309
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,040
so i suggest to discuss this at the end

310
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,639
of the meeting

311
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,839
and we are almost done

312
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:04,079
for this for the chair slides

313
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,320
uh yes we i can say that

314
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,519
we we still are planning to are still

315
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,720
planning to close this

316
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,760
research group mid

317
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,600
mid 2021 so probably after the july

318
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,240
meeting next year

319
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,320
this is still the goal and we'll of

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,920
course uh

321
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,839
have an itf uh network research group

322
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,760
meeting network calling research group

323
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
meeting for next uh during next itf and

324
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,600
hopefully uh

325
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,518
i wasn't uh able in position to do this

326
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
uh accustomed to l this accustomed this

327
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
time

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,920
about the swift codec but i hope uh

329
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
to be able to do so for next atf we have

330
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,199
to finalize this

331
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,839
disconnect between before closing the

332
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,839
group so that's for the status

333
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
so

334
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,079
foreign

335
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,079
presentation so

336
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,480
nicola i suggest we continue with your

337
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,839
presentation

338
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,839
nicola can you hear me

339
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,920
can you hear me yes it's okay

340
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:45,600

341
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,279
um hello everyone

342
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,880
this is an update on the coding and

343
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,600
construction control draft

344
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,360
we have been working on in the last few

345
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,759
months

346
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,759
just next to me there are lots of uh

347
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
word works uh so maybe noise during the

348
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,120
condition

349
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,440
i'm sorry in advance for that next slide

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,639
please

351
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,920
um since

352
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,959
last itf we have

353
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,680
done a lot of experiments and also

354
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,959
adding i did a very large discussion

355
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,239
section

356
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,959
i will go through first to experiment in

357
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,320
the presentation and then go over the

358
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,359
whole draft again

359
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,199
um but i just wanted to show here uh

360
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,480
just looking at the table of content and

361
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,120
the amount of sections

362
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
that have been added in the document

363
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
next slide please

364
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,439
so thanks to the people

365
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,360
which names are listed on the list here

366
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,639
on the slide here

367
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,279
we have done some experiments

368
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,240
um basically we have two different

369
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,519
setups

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,000
one is using an http or gcp server and

371
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,120
the other one is using quick over udp

372
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,559
over ib

373
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:12,719
and we we use pico quick with

374
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,720
cubic construction control and

375
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,520
we use a tetris tunnel

376
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,640
below the transport layer

377
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,639
and next slide please

378
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,639
we have three different types of

379
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,940
satellite links that i use

380
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,240
we we have

381
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,440
[Music]

382
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,200
one that is mobile and users

383
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,840
this is a use case we have already shown

384
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,480
to the group before

385
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,199
basically the mumbai new there is a

386
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,960
train

387
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,559
and there are obstacles that are regular

388
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
so when you look at the picture on the

389
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,039
bottom right of the slide

390
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,160
you can see that we have regular packet

391
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,200
losses

392
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,320
um on the top um this

393
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,960
is something that um reflects

394
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,678
uh the losses that could happen with

395
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,799
optical

396
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
links so this is a huge trend in satcom

397
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,840
systems to use optical links

398
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:20,399
on the feeder or on whatever

399
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,439
length so to go through these

400
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,039
frequencies to increase the data rate

401
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,600
so but this can come with losses so a

402
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,879
lot of

403
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,399
work on it this is very high level view

404
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
but this is something we could see um

405
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,760
where basically we have lots of bursts

406
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
of losses

407
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,400
on the optical link we also have a case

408
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,600
where we have a dvds2 classical

409
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,880
satellite link without any losses

410
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,480
um another thing that we change

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,039
during the experiment and sometimes we

412
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,720
use wi-fi we emulate wi-fi losses

413
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,480
sometimes we don't so it's just one

414
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,360
person to order classes

415
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,799
and sometimes we just run tests with

416
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,479
single flows and

417
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:08,080
sometimes we just add a

418
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,600
load with a viable amount of loads

419
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,840
to introduce congestion um

420
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,678
the in these transitions i just show

421
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,080
possible results uh

422
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,320
i think the objective is to show why

423
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,439
what is in this document is important

424
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,520
um and the rest of the results are

425
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,160
under sufficient at the moment so next

426
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
slide please

427
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,160
basically just throw one level here

428
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,199
when we have the mobile user and

429
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,559
we download 20 megabytes

430
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,880
and we have here i just show the median

431
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,840
over

432
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,840
more than 20 tests um so

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,200
if we just compare basically the fourth

434
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,120
the four

435
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,160
first lines i use the fcc tetris tunnel

436
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,678
the four below ones uh

437
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
last ones do not so here we showcases

438
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,400
with

439
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
without wi-fi with and without

440
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
congestion

441
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,240
um what um

442
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,240
i wanted to highlight i will not go

443
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,600
through the whole details of the results

444
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,159
but what i wanted to highlight is that

445
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,559
when we compare what

446
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,919
what we have with the epc tunnel and

447
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,720
when we don't have it

448
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,039
that we have a drastic reduction of the

449
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,679
20 megabytes download time

450
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,480
so this is why we could be very happy

451
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
and oh yeah

452
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,840
my fpc solution is the best it works for

453
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,918
both tcp and quick and it's very great

454
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,199
i just also wanted to say that if we

455
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:43,440
look in the details

456
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,200
um when we speak about fec and

457
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,159
condition control interactions we can

458
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,640
see that this depends on

459
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,559
the congestion control itself because

460
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,080
here we use the exact same

461
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,559
fpc tunnel but we use quick

462
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,960
and dcb and we can see that the results

463
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,440
differ

464
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,440
um next slide please

465
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:14,060
um here

466
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,280
on in green this is

467
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,918
[Music]

468
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
the accumulated throughput of the 10

469
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,360
basically we have 10

470
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,399
coded flows and 10 non-coded flows

471
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,320
we can see here is

472
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,360
on in green is that when we introduce

473
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,720
the 10 non-coding flows

474
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,000
the amount of the cumulative data rate

475
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,280
is the same

476
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,640
but below the flows

477
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,559
10 flows are coded 10 are not so what we

478
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,440
can see here is that the rest of the

479
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,879
traffic

480
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,919
um has very

481
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,080
fees its amount of available that are

482
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,960
diminished so this is a big problem um

483
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,678
basically when we introduce coded flows

484
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,360
uh

485
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,120
and when they share about the neck with

486
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,199
non-credit flows uh

487
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,080
this can have a very large impact on the

488
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
data rate of the others but this is

489
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,320
somehow what

490
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,280
we wanted to mention on the impact of

491
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,480
the fairness

492
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,440
when you actually introduce coding

493
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,440
next slide please

494
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,559
and this is what happens uh basically

495
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,760
this is the same experiment but we use

496
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,399
quick this time

497
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,960
and what we can see here is that at the

498
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,039
bottom

499
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,799
uh when we have 10 coded flows

500
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:46,640
using quick you can see that the housers

501
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,360
barely can send any traffic so this is a

502
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
very big problem and this is one of the

503
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,600
reasons why

504
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,880
we say they ease they can be as of

505
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,409
unfairness when we you actually use

506
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,280
coding inside the tunnel and

507
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:04,880
[Music]

508
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,240
it doesn't and when you don't consider

509
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,120
congestion losses in your when you

510
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,919
hide the congestion losses end-to-end

511
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,918
next slide please

512
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:22,159
so basically this experiment shows

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,320
why we should not speak about a pc

514
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,840
without speaking about constructive

515
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,439
control

516
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:33,840
basically fpc and custom controls

517
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,120
can be seen as two different things and

518
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,360
fpc could hide so just like

519
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,479
marijuana said in the introduction

520
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,120
should have

521
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,039
signals basically this document

522
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,039
try to discuss all these two things can

523
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,960
coexist and

524
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,640
also encourage the retention community

525
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,480
to consider construction control when

526
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,480
proposing and corporate effect solutions

527
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,440
otherwise they can fall in the same trap

528
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
as we did

529
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,960
saying we have a fabulous fcc mechanism

530
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,520
for all satellite use cases but then

531
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,279
we end up having very important and

532
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,000
fairness issues

533
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,000
next slide please

534
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,439
um there are very wordy slides

535
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,000
the ident was to recall the whole

536
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,400
document for those who haven't read it

537
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,559
i realized that i'm only having eight

538
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,760
minutes left so i may go

539
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,840
uh quickly on that basically fec

540
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,679
and construction controls are can be

541
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,720
seen as two different objectives

542
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,720
next slide please

543
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,879
there's something we didn't discuss

544
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,158
before this is from how new

545
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,760
in the document is that

546
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,760
the relevance of the discussion of

547
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,158
interactions between npc

548
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,000
and conjunction control depends a lot on

549
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,480
the transfer transport layer itself

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,840
because we can use uh non-variable

551
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,320
transport service or

552
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,120
partially reliable transport service uh

553
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
or we

554
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,120
transparently depending on how

555
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,200
the fpc inclusion controls are scheduled

556
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,239
uh the impact of variable transport on

557
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:15,840
fpc mechanism

558
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,840
is very different next slide please

559
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
there are basically three possibilities

560
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,279
and either

561
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,279
fec is above transport

562
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,199
um

563
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,360
our next slide please i think i'll go

564
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,120
this was already presented uh in the

565
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,039
present of this idea

566
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,399
if you see he can be within the

567
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,440
transport

568
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,080
or fec can be below the transport

569
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,080
the next slide

570
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,520
next slide please

571
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,600
and so these

572
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,440
we have introduced uh in the document

573
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,199
and different advantages and drawbacks

574
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,360
on having a pc above

575
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,480
within our bureau's transport and um

576
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,080
what we have added is a more wider

577
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,279
discussion section on

578
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,520
um the different um

579
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,720
going more into the details uh so this

580
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,000
is what are we going to

581
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,320
i will present now um there are been

582
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
some

583
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
discussions and paperwork under our

584
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,910
books when you speak about

585
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,720
policy fairness

586
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:31,360
[Music]

587
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
because if we look at this figure we

588
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,399
have two different

589
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,320
views we have the cpe of

590
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,760
the local network or the on the right

591
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,960
side

592
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,158
this one may use satellite access and

593
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,799
the satellite operator guarantees that

594
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,279
there are

595
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,279
there's no

596
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,639
unfairness between the different users

597
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,799
satellite terminals

598
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,080
this is the theme that could be seen at

599
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,200
the ue level

600
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,360
in a lte 3gpp network

601
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,840
basically we have we we should not have

602
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,320
fairness issues when we look at the cpe

603
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,760
level or the ue level

604
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,240
in a network that being said

605
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,799
when there are flows sharing the same

606
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
qrs

607
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,080
and the same contracts then fairness

608
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,320
discussion applies

609
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
but that could be for example different

610
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,360
applications running on one

611
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,480
viewing and 3gbp or

612
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:35,120
the different computers behind

613
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,000
one end of the terminal at home

614
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,000
for next slide please

615
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,840
um this slide and three for the side of

616
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,039
it i wanted to have everything

617
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,080
um in the same um

618
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,720
figure and um basically these are

619
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,840
the different uh teams over which we

620
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,799
went through

621
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,360
over which we went for uh discussing um

622
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,399
the

623
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,639
impacts of having a pc above within or

624
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:11,520
building some sports

625
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,520
we have looked at fairness issues

626
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,360
how construction control uses

627
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,240
recovered symbols um

628
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,479
the impact of the interactions between

629
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,039
sequential control and the coding rates

630
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
and what happens to useless sweeper

631
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,679
symbols

632
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,918
there are discussions and things we had

633
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,919
um

634
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,520
doing the these things were just we

635
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,959
this is based on comments we had from

636
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,279
the list or when we

637
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,840
already presented the documents

638
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,720
previously

639
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,600
um i don't know chairs if i have time to

640
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,320
go through

641
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,719
the different points here or should i

642
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,080
rather

643
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,039
ask for people opinion not released

644
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,000
are you saying nicola you can take a bit

645
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
more time because i

646
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,640
guess that raymond will not show up and

647
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,320
maybe won't have the bats discussion

648
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
that's presentation so if you want to

649
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,240
take five ten more minutes

650
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:17,120
i think it's feasible

651
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:20,880
okay thank you i will um then um

652
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,760
just go quickly over this uh um

653
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,480
basically we think um something that

654
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,640
comes

655
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,600
a lot from this table

656
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,399
is that when we look at the fairness and

657
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,399
the impact on the non-connect flows

658
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,120
um there is an issue

659
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,239
for the fake bill transport case such as

660
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,760
we shown earlier

661
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,559
on the presentation um

662
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,399
we think that this can this approach can

663
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,960
drastically reduce a good good for the

664
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:55,120
nonprofit flows

665
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,320
but then specific signals can be

666
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,840
proposed such as

667
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
a technique that has been proposed by

668
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,360
manual earlier in previous ltf meetings

669
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,799
this is the solutions could be proposed

670
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,399
but would be then

671
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,639
protocol event

672
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,639
um

673
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
another thing uh if we look at for

674
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,039
example something that

675
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,918
we think is very important and we would

676
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,399
like to highlight

677
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,440
is the interaction between condition

678
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,879
control and

679
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,279
coding rates um

680
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,960
this mostly very interesting for the

681
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,000
fake within transport case because

682
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,200
they a very large

683
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,799
trade-off between reducing the output

684
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,240
when we actually um we send

685
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,799
a us useless reverse symbols but then

686
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,640
this can help to recover fully from

687
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,120
transmission and condition losses

688
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,840
but still we should be able

689
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,959
to propose in the case of the effect

690
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,559
within transport

691
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,200
um signaling to enable receivers to

692
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,158
indicate

693
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,440
precisely the number of source packets

694
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,600
that have been received

695
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,720
the number of repair packets that were

696
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,080
actually used for

697
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,120
in the recovery process and

698
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,799
so this um using the

699
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,239
the favorite may actually be able to

700
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,279
exploit the information given by the

701
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,320
receiver to

702
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,460
use reduce the number of useless repair

703
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,840
packets

704
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,960
[Music]

705
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:32,000
if we look at this table if

706
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,279
i let or have time to read

707
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,799
it uh later after the meeting but

708
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,320
our main conclusion is that for the fake

709
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,600
period of transport

710
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,120
there may be lots of issues we just had

711
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,840
loads on the network um we

712
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,719
they infinite issues and we are not

713
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,678
aware of

714
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,399
the constitutional control

715
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,679
implementation so we think um this is

716
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,678
something that should be either

717
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
for the moment we just describe it in

718
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,720
the draft we don't take position on

719
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,600
what is advised or not but this is

720
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,480
something important to consider

721
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,480
next slide please

722
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,799
in general

723
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:20,158
[Music]

724
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,158
jose recommended us to

725
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,760
try to come up with open research

726
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,399
question and

727
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:33,440
indeed there are basically

728
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,600
because we when we use coding

729
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,919
we will use a good put and when we send

730
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,559
useless with a packet with a symbols

731
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,320
and but then we can help recover from

732
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,760
transmission congestion losses

733
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,279
so this trade-off is

734
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,360
always here and but the the way

735
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,880
you actually can consider it depends a

736
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,158
lot on the

737
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,120
relation between the effect and the

738
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,120
transport so if we start with the right

739
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,399
column and when we are in the effect

740
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,399
below transport case

741
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,918
um the wave the fairness issues that we

742
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,439
mentioned earlier on

743
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:14,000
and um also sometimes you may have

744
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
different streams um multiple

745
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,679
applications

746
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,120
streams sharing the fcc channel so

747
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,480
this is something that needs to be

748
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,439
considered because we use the same

749
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,360
efficiency mechanism

750
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,000
for all frames so that may be

751
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,399
something that needs to be investigated

752
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,600
in the case of the fake within transport

753
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:39,039
we have the room to

754
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:42,240
define to define a specific

755
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,279
signaling between both entities so this

756
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,399
is very interesting and

757
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,080
there are already proposals for quick

758
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,080
such as the one from francois

759
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,799
because we can actually disambiguate the

760
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,080
act packet from the crippled packets

761
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,600
so we can try to identify new signal

762
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,519
limit certain fpc

763
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
because recovery aware construction

764
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,720
controls

765
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,600
then we could even have dynamic coding

766
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,199
rates using

767
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,918
another construction controls for

768
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,040
example lower than this default one

769
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,199
there are lots of things that could be

770
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,480
possible in this faculty and transport

771
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,839
case

772
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,240
for the effect you both transport

773
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,359
basically this is mostly all related to

774
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,359
application requirements

775
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:38,399
next slide please

776
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,879
um our advices for evaluating goodies

777
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,159
games

778
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:43,839
is to avoid the

779
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,280
things we described at the beginning of

780
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,879
the presentation

781
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
being showing a good performances or fpc

782
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,960
mechanisms

783
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,078
and ignoring the issues and the impact

784
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,680
on the purchasing control

785
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,200
and the fairness of it so we propose to

786
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,440
map the contribution with the proposed

787
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:06,000
organization of the document

788
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,680
this is very important in our opinion

789
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,760
and there is always um

790
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,879
an important aspect with that when we

791
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,839
hide a

792
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,760
packet for signal to the construction

793
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,799
control

794
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,720
it is very important to assess the

795
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,359
advantages

796
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,078
of it as opposed to just ignoring

797
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,610
proportion or

798
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,760
contact losses of the constraint control

799
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,480
[Music]

800
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,640
that would be a very good bottom line

801
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,470
for the evaluations

802
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,839
on the performances of the proposals

[Music]

804
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,240
and also such as being much already on

805
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,640
discuss the impact of hiding losses to

806
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,680
the

807
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,160
congressional controls mechanism next

808
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,598
slide please

809
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,799
this is the last one we have

810
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,280
i did lots of discussions element and we

811
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,640
think

812
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,880
that now we need to reorganize the

813
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,118
document a bit

814
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,640
so this is something that we need to do

815
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,079
before

816
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,118
for the next submission that's something

817
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,119
we have in mind and

818
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,960
the document should be improved this way

819
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,720
we may

820
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,160
come up with some recommendations i'm

821
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,118
not sure that's not the objective of

822
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,240
this document but

823
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,880
when we have written

824
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,479
all that's in the table of the

825
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,800
comparison

826
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,680
presented earlier on i think there may

827
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,720
be some recommendations that could be

828
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,598
written but we

829
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,200
need to discuss that and obviously we

830
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,200
are very happy to have any

831
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:52,000
questions or comments on the document

832
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:57,040
thank you thank you nicola

833
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,320
questions comments from the audience

834
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,520
um i have one but uh it's not as uh

835
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,520
as a tear um

836
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,240
this is important work because uh as

837
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,040
people have been involved with

838
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,359
coding for a long time no um you know

839
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,040
the

840
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,240
the congestion control always comes

841
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,560
as a as a problem

842
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,118
and as one way in fact of dismissing

843
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,480
the use of of fec and what you showed

844
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,000
yes you know if you

845
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,480
go through with your coded stream um

846
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,119
everything every everybody else uh you

847
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,320
know

848
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,119
falls back and sure you you think you're

849
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,359
coding

850
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:43,119
your recorded stream works perfectly but

851
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,160
it's because everybody else

852
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,359
lost their bandwidth um so

853
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,598
this this was interesting results um

854
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,759
but and again as we also consider

855
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,960
coding for quick uh it's also very

856
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,560
important

857
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,400
so you say you know in the avenues for

858
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,880
research do you know anybody

859
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,760
who is doing the research or it's just

860
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,760
avenues now

861
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,640
um well besides doing besides you doing

862
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,480
the research or the

863
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,839
the authors uh do you think this has

864
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
been picked up by other people

865
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,079
um we

866
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,200
we know there may be some interactions

867
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,280
with

868
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,480
what's going on in the loops working

869
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,079
group but

870
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,280
he's still not a group

871
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,400
we think there is interest in these

872
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,200
discussions but we haven't had far more

873
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,560
feedback from

874
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,560
other people working on that we know

875
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,440
that a lot of people working on uh fec

876
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,839
mechanisms

877
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
as a transport player but we don't know

878
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,520
if they actually

879
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,520
are interested and if they actually

880
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,839
are looking in the track we are in the

881
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,480
process of adding

882
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,440
state-of-the-art section where we listed

883
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,560
all the

884
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,240
articles research articles

885
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:14,720
with this kind of discussions

886
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,720
we are actually in the moment listing

887
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,399
that we are we have on the to-do list

888
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,520
for this document i should have

889
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,280
mentioned it but

890
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,720
still not um we could not

891
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,520
uh sort all the papers in time for this

892
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,680
meeting

893
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,480
but this is something we plan on doing

894
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,480
for the next uh

895
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:46,960
okay thank you it can be quite ambitious

896
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,959
because sorting all this work being done

897
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,160
now well we

898
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,480
we have started to list some papers

899
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,078
is on the github for anyone who wants to

900
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:11,839
look at that

901
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:11,839
we we have started

902
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,400
okay i think we have a problem currently

903
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,040
nicola

904
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,040
we have no feedback no audio from you

905
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,720
yes i think it's a general issue but uh

906
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:12,079
the chat is still working can you hear

907
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,078
me can anybody hear me

908
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,560
a second okay so it's more on the

909
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,040
nicolas side than uh okay which is too

910
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,400
quick yeah we

911
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,319
in the queue too okay okay uh

912
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:34,000
people have to go to a different network

913
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:37,200
to reconnect

914
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,640
uh maybe you can switch to a next

915
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,799
presentation

916
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,799
i cannot hear nicola anymore

917
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,200
people uh on in the queue

918
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,880
uh maybe you can post your question on

919
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,680
slack

920
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,599
i think i created the network coding

921
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,399
research group channel on slack if you

922
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,880
want to post your questions there nicola

923
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,520
can see

924
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,760
could see them there and answer them uh

925
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,720
later

926
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,680
and can we avoid adding another

927
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,680
communication channel

928
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,480
i will not comment on that

929
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,440
but i did i did create them so

930
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,160
we can use them so there is a network

931
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,280
coding

932
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,040
channel so if you want to post your

933
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,200
questions there

934
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,720
at least i'm going to be able to capture

935
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,399
them and send them

936
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:41,680
to nicola if he doesn't i mean i'm back

937
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,520
oh you you're back ah great excuse me

938
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,440
so there were two people in the queue

939
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,440
nicola okay

940
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,440
kirsten and morton

941
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,560
norton you might add your quest you

942
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,440
asked for a question yeah

943
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,078
thank you very much a nice presentation

944
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,119
nicholas

945
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,150
i agree it's it's this is important uh

946
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,640
work to be done right um

947
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,760
[Music]

948
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,560
so there's one thing that that

949
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,000
that maybe i i i don't understand maybe

950
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,560
you can clarify a little bit

951
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,079
so when you say coding above the

952
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,440
transport

953
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,400
um to me that that doesn't

954
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,079
sort of that wouldn't make that much

955
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,720
sense because if you have something like

956
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,000
tcp

957
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,000
underneath which is doing

958
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
re-transmissions or quick which is doing

959
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,920
re-transmissions

960
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,359
you wouldn't really see any losses above

961
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,359
the transport

962
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,279
unless you're running like on top of

963
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,000
something like directly on top of

964
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,119
something like

965
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,800
like like udp for example

966
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,839
um so can you maybe clarify a little bit

967
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,599
what you mean about

968
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,599
coding above the transport

969
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,799
um thank you for for your question um

970
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,640
and this thing

971
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,720
um by coding about transport we mean

972
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,680
uh coding at the application level

973
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,640
mostly

974
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,078
uh i agree that this does not actually

975
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,200
make sense when

976
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,200
the objective is discuss the impacts

977
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,560
and the interactions between congestion

978
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,919
control and

979
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,119
fpc at the moment we have added it

980
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,800
just to be sure that we discuss all the

981
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,800
cases

982
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,640
below within above and in the document

983
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,680
i think that we say what you just said

984
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,279
we agree on that basically saying uh it

985
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,759
doesn't make sense since you if you are

986
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,280
above

987
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:42,000
tcp and basically udp

988
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,000
is the most relevant case

989
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,759
for the transport in this scenario

990
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,000
okay make sense we agree on your point

991
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,880
and

992
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,520
this is what i think uh actually at

993
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,200
least that's

994
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,880
that is what we tried to put in this

995
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,640
document and if it's not

996
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:05,839
clearly said we may have another

997
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,839
pass on that

998
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,440
well i think probably the document is

999
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,599
fine was just uh possible

1000
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,599
in the presentation so i'm pretty sure

1001
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,640
that it's written in the document should

1002
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,000
be just fine

1003
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,000
yeah thank you

1004
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,599
um carlton carsten you had a question

1005
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,920
yes um so the the

1006
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,920
effect you showed at the beginning of

1007
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:33,040
your slides is not the result of adding

1008
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,079
avc it's a result of hiding losses

1009
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,400
from entering congestion control and

1010
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,200
that is how how you are doing actual

1011
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,319
harm and

1012
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,200
you shouldn't do harm so

1013
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,800
um i don't know if you have read

1014
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,759
renishaware's

1015
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:54,560
paper one year ago from hot nets 2019

1016
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,240
where she she examines the the concept

1017
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,680
of fairness

1018
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,640
and actually suggests replacing it with

1019
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,000
the concept of

1020
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,200
not doing harm uh she will

1021
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,960
present that on friday in the irtf open

1022
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,759
uh meeting because it won the the nrp

1023
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,079
uh prize i think that that's a pretty

1024
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,640
good

1025
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,680
basis for for continuing with the work

1026
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,799
because the drum

1027
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,598
fairness may not be

1028
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,560
a very useful term as we have found out

1029
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,160
in like the

1030
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,480
last 25 years um but

1031
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,720
what i really wanted to comment about is

1032
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,640
the that you are missing a column

1033
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:40,240
um your category uh fec below

1034
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,920
transport really should be called fec

1035
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:46,399
disconnected from transport

1036
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,000
and i think what what most people who

1037
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,359
work in this base agree is that

1038
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,839
fsc actually has to do some signaling

1039
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:55,680
to the transport and this is probably a

1040
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,920
more interesting

1041
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,319
column than the column where you don't

1042
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,720
have any signaling at all

1043
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,160
of course if you integrate fec into

1044
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,200
transport

1045
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,598
then you have that signaling uh

1046
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,640
implicitly so that the efficiency can

1047
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,440
talk

1048
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,400
um to to the congestion control in the

1049
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,560
transport

1050
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,000
but if it's done by different entities

1051
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,279
as i understand

1052
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,400
was the case with your tetris tunnel

1053
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,280
then you have to do some some signaling

1054
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,319
and then of course the interesting

1055
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,480
question is

1056
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,558
how do we do the signaling and i think

1057
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,079
that's an area where the interesting

1058
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:37,520
research questions

1059
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,480
um are um so the first question is how

1060
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,520
do you

1061
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,640
actually send the signal and so far the

1062
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,559
only

1063
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:49,040
way we have found is using ecn

1064
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,880
so you use something like ce marks to to

1065
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,480
indicate that the packet was

1066
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,160
recovered and not did not make it

1067
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,839
originally

1068
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,598
but i think the the more interesting

1069
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,640
question is how much

1070
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:06,240
can you actually minimize harm

1071
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,960
by doing this signaling so do you really

1072
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,078
have to completely emulate

1073
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:16,480
the situation where where all losses

1074
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,480
are indicated as congestion

1075
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:22,559
periods or whether you actually can

1076
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,160
can do a more intelligent form of that

1077
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,760
signal and that's really the kind of

1078
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,759
research that

1079
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,440
i would like to see because the fec

1080
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,640
layer of course has more information

1081
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,520
about this

1082
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,160
um and it would be good to relay some of

1083
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,800
this

1084
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,399
information to the congestion control

1085
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,480
and the problem of course is

1086
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,680
that congestion control may actually not

1087
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,359
be aware

1088
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,720
of the whole thing going on so you can

1089
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:49,839
only talk to it

1090
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,839
in the languages it understands

1091
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:55,119
uh thank you for for for these comments

1092
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,720
uh

1093
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,960
on the on the the first part uh

1094
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,279
i have read the paper and i think we

1095
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,480
should we could indeed

1096
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,720
include that in the draft we just wanted

1097
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,720
to

1098
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,559
also we were not sure

1099
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,399
to what extent we should open the

1100
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,240
pandora box on fairness

1101
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,160
in this document but it is true that

1102
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,240
this is something we need to discuss

1103
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:26,640
we wanted to if we look at slides 14

1104
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,680
we also wanted to mention because

1105
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:31,520
sometimes

1106
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:35,279
when fairness is discussed

1107
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:38,000
with a typical dumbbell

1108
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,000
architecture

1109
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,558
that's not actually what we have

1110
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,400
deployed today because

1111
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,240
we have actually lots of quality of

1112
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,920
service mechanisms like guarantee

1113
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:49,520
fairness between users

1114
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,200
so this is something that needs also to

1115
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,720
be discussed when you

1116
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,960
speak about fairness and this is a very

1117
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,078
policy concern so this is why we refer

1118
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,480
to bob uh

1119
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:06,000
schools work on floor rate fairness

1120
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,119
um but and that's also i think uh

1121
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,559
the definition on not to harm others

1122
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,680
it's something we tried to

1123
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:19,359
map in this presentation

1124
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:22,558
but we may make this more formally

1125
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,520
internet version of this document

1126
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,440
i would tend to disagree on when you

1127
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,680
propose to say that when we have

1128
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,800
the effect below is the effect

1129
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,640
disconnected

1130
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,400
uh because we mentioned

1131
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,240
the case of the tet net and all these

1132
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,359
things where we actually can have a

1133
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,279
signaling

1134
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,200
between the fcc and the transport layer

1135
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,160
we just mentioned that this is protocol

1136
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,359
specific

1137
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,040
and this cannot be done in general

1138
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,680
and so i think indeed i would agree with

1139
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,119
you

1140
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,919
too um

1141
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,559
research question i think the one on

1142
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,960
improving

1143
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,640
um quality of experience while

1144
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,440
guaranteeing fairness to other with

1145
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,960
other flows

1146
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,000
is something we are currently covering

1147
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,400
the definition of uh signals

1148
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,400
uh for the fake video transport case may

1149
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
not so it just needs to be more clear

1150
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,720
thank you thank you

1151
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,200
okay thank you nicola uh we are a bit

1152
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,558
short of time so it's now time to switch

1153
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:37,839
to the next session

1154
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:37,839
sorry uh

1155
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,839
oh i have yeah it's coming

1156
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,439
okay i have a small problem sharing

1157
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:24,160
okay it's up button your draw

1158
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,440
thank you very much i hope everybody the

1159
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,720
audio is going through

1160
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,839
well to everybody so

1161
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,240
i have a short presentation here on

1162
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,720
repair patterns for sliding window codes

1163
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,439
and this really came about because we

1164
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,919
were doing

1165
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,559
a couple of projects where we were

1166
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,079
working

1167
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:47,280
on very low latency applications so

1168
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:49,680
in an end-to-end fashion and

1169
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,319
working on those applications we learned

1170
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,359
that

1171
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:54,240
our intuition about how to produce the

1172
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,680
repair

1173
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,160
wasn't really correct so i would like to

1174
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,440
sort of

1175
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,118
spend a few minutes presenting our our

1176
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,280
findings here and maybe get some

1177
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,760
feedback from you guys on on what what

1178
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,640
your

1179
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,760
if you have some some some views on this

1180
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,920
um

1181
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,839
so if we take the next slide it just uh

1182
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,079
a brief background right for

1183
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:20,000
for those that may not have seen sliding

1184
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,680
window codes before the sort of but most

1185
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,839
people are probably familiar with the

1186
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,839
traditional blog codes so what we have

1187
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,720
there is basically we have a set of

1188
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,960
packets and from that set of packets

1189
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,879
we produce some amount of repair and

1190
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,960
then we have another set of packets and

1191
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,559
we produce repair from those

1192
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,000
from that and we call those set of

1193
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,400
packets a block

1194
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,319
and in this specific case we have four

1195
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,800
packets in every block and we produce

1196
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:48,480
two repair from every block so that's a

1197
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,480
that's a most fec codes can operate or

1198
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,760
erase your codes can operate in this

1199
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,359
block mode

1200
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,240
but sort of in recent the years we have

1201
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,759
also seen

1202
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,598
a bunch of implementations that are

1203
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,920
looking more at something called sliding

1204
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,920
window codes where

1205
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,599
where at the figure at the bottom you

1206
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,599
can see

1207
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:11,440
sort of in the dashed line the coding

1208
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:14,160
window and it's sort of

1209
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,760
packets are not sort of grouped into

1210
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,920
individual blocks but packets are

1211
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,319
flowing through the same coding window

1212
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,559
and

1213
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,079
at any given point in time we can decide

1214
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,599
to generate prepare

1215
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,200
for the packets that are currently in

1216
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,680
the window uh

1217
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,879
this window can then be managed for

1218
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,319
example in time

1219
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,200
so you can say like uh packet number one

1220
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,599
is gonna be useful for 80 milliseconds

1221
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,000
and

1222
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:40,160
if that's so that's for how that's how

1223
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,280
long i can continue to include it in my

1224
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,480
encoding

1225
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,720
and once it's sort of above this

1226
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,319
80 milliseconds i just drop it from my

1227
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,118
encoding and if i haven't

1228
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,079
decoded it at that point in time i also

1229
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,200
have to drop it

1230
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,200
on the on the receiver side um

1231
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,598
those types of protocols can be quite

1232
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,040
useful for low latency applications

1233
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,720
i'm not going to go too much into that

1234
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,680
but but they basically can be used to

1235
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,200
minimize

1236
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,440
latency but um

1237
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,680
one of the sort of interesting questions

1238
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,359
that that come about is that

1239
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,799
when you when you use these protocols

1240
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,799
you typically have some

1241
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:18,559
packet loss that you want to overcome

1242
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,559
can be that you're observing let's say

1243
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,920
five percent packet loss and you want to

1244
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:26,319
generate repair to to uh

1245
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,000
fix that packet loss in advance right

1246
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,920
because it's a low latency protocol you

1247
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,280
don't really want to use retransmissions

1248
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,480
because there you have to go back and

1249
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,160
forth over the link

1250
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,520
so that might be okay if it's a low

1251
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,759
latency link but if it

1252
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,480
if the link is is expensive from a

1253
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,920
latency perspective it might not be okay

1254
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,839
um so how to do how to generate this

1255
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,720
repair what is the best pattern

1256
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,279
is is a question that we sort of had to

1257
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,640
answer

1258
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,559
if you take the next slide so here we

1259
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,319
have two different repair patterns and

1260
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,400
on the left

1261
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,480
what we have here is symbols coming in

1262
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,240
so s1 s2 s3 s4

1263
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,480
so forth there are symbols that's

1264
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,319
basically equivalent to a network packet

1265
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,280
can be from a video frame or something

1266
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,119
like that

1267
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,880
and then what we do is that we can

1268
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,359
generate this repair

1269
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,559
which includes some of these symbols

1270
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:19,359
right r1 r2 are including s1

1271
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,040
vs4 and what you have on the left and on

1272
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,160
the right is two different repair

1273
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,160
patterns

1274
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,839
on the left we have a four comma two

1275
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,480
repair pattern so we take in

1276
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,078
four packets and we generate two repair

1277
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,680
then we take four more packets and we

1278
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,920
generate two repair

1279
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,440
the coding window in this case is eight

1280
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,559
so you see that the

1281
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,160
the the blocks or the coding windows are

1282
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,839
overlapping right which is different

1283
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,558
from a block code

1284
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,839
um but actually they produce the same

1285
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,200
rate of repair

1286
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:51,599
so all of them produce 33

1287
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,520
uh and on the on the on the right side

1288
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,119
we have a two comma one repair pattern

1289
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,839
where we generate two packets and then

1290
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,079
one repair two packets and then one

1291
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:00,960
repair

1292
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,680
and if you look at the at a column you

1293
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,240
will see that

1294
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,040
every symbol is covered by four repair

1295
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,078
packets

1296
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:10,839
so from a protection point of view

1297
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,240
those these two schemes seem to be

1298
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:14,078
equivalent

1299
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,359
and also from a repair rate point of

1300
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,920
view they produce the same

1301
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:18,480
overhead from a bandwidth perspective so

1302
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,559
which

1303
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,559
one is the better one which one to pick

1304
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,359
for certain situations

1305
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,319
so if you take the next slide if you

1306
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,759
look at

1307
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,200
the something like a uniform traffic so

1308
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,359
what do i mean by that

1309
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,399
uh in the in the figure here we gave

1310
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,558
every

1311
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,799
symbol a different color indicating that

1312
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,880
they arrive at different times

1313
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:41,839
we also put a deadline which means that

1314
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,000
the expire

1315
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:45,759
after 80 milliseconds so in this case

1316
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,720
every symbol arrives

1317
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,359
after 10 milliseconds and expire after

1318
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,839
80.

1319
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:54,640
so you see that symbol number 1 will

1320
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:56,960
expire when symbol number nine arrives

1321
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,240
indicated by this sort of dashed gray

1322
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,720
line right

1323
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,720
and the what you can also notice here is

1324
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,558
that the distance to repair

1325
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,279
is minimized right we have sort of

1326
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,079
shrunk down we were generating repair

1327
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,200
as quickly as possible for this specific

1328
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,960
repair rate

1329
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,799
so so there's no way that we can move

1330
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,599
the repair closer to this

1331
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,480
or sort of spread out the repair

1332
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,040
uniformly

1333
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,280
in all the symbols right so in all the

1334
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,119
symbols and they get the same

1335
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,960
protection all of them are still covered

1336
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,079
by four packets

1337
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,720
and the latency penalty of losing symbol

1338
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,760
one

1339
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,240
is 10 milliseconds because r1

1340
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,160
is generated directly after s2

1341
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,399
[Music]

1342
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,598
if you then take the 4 comma 2 repair

1343
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,559
pattern under the same

1344
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,200
on the next slide on the same under the

1345
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:49,119
same conditions

1346
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,960
if you move to yeah yeah if you then

1347
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,680
take the sort of the other repair

1348
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,960
pattern

1349
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,399
you will see that we

1350
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,880
we have the same uh protection here

1351
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,559
but but we are not minimizing the

1352
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,880
distance to repair

1353
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,920
so actually what will happen is that if

1354
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,720
we lose the first

1355
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,920
symbol s1 we actually have to wait 30

1356
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,720
milliseconds

1357
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,920
to generate the repair and fix that

1358
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,959
packet loss

1359
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,079
so for this type of of and this was sort

1360
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,400
of our intuition

1361
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,880
was that sort of spreading the repair

1362
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,559
sort of equidistantly out in the stream

1363
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
would be the best because we would then

1364
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,720
minimize the distance to repair from a

1365
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,720
latency perspective

1366
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,240
but what is interesting is what happens

1367
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,000
when we actually look at something like

1368
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,118
a thirsty traffic pattern

1369
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,760
and if you take the next slide

1370
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,760
so here you see that we have the first

1371
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,000
four symbols they actually arrive at the

1372
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,839
same time so this could be a video frame

1373
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,480
consisting of four

1374
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,920
network packets for example and now it's

1375
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,400
all the same but but then

1376
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:54,480
in real applications of course the video

1377
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,119
frames would be sort of made out of

1378
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,799
different

1379
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,000
amounts of packets but just for

1380
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:03,040
simplicity every frame here is

1381
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,480
is four packets and

1382
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:08,480
um when we do it this way when we do the

1383
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,480
two comma one repair pattern which sort

1384
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,720
of for the uniform case

1385
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,599
looked like it was the best one we

1386
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,879
actually see

1387
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:20,400
that the the symbols s3

1388
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,920
and s4 they are not protected as well as

1389
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:26,720
s1 and s2 because they they expire

1390
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,599
before ir5 is generated and in the

1391
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,240
uniform case r5 will also cover s3 and

1392
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,160
s4

1393
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,040
but in this case because they arrive as

1394
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,000
a group of packets they also expire

1395
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,759
as a group of packets and therefore this

1396
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,359
this way of doing the repair

1397
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,280
actually means that we get less

1398
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:45,839
protection when we have

1399
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,559
uh when we have the the repair packets

1400
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:50,960
interleaved within the block of packets

1401
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,599
the latency penalty of moving losing is

1402
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,400
one is

1403
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,559
zero milliseconds approximately because

1404
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
we generate the repair right after

1405
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,400
receiving these four packets which

1406
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,240
arrive at the same time and we generate

1407
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,680
the repair instantaneously

1408
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,520
of course there's some computational

1409
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,040
overhead and all this but but from a

1410
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,480
millisecond point of view that that

1411
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:12,000
doesn't matter much

1412
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:15,920
if we then look at the 4 comma 2 case

1413
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:19,440
what is interesting is that actually

1414
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,170
on the next slide that

1415
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:23,680
in this case we still have the same

1416
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:26,720
[Music]

1417
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,720
we still have the same sort of distance

1418
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:30,319
to repair right because the four packets

1419
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,839
arrive at the same time

1420
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,720
but now r1 and r2 both cover all four

1421
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,599
packets

1422
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,680
inside the frame which means that a and

1423
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,640
if you then look at the columns again

1424
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,879
you can see that now

1425
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,319
everybody is covered by four repair

1426
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,480
packets again

1427
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:52,319
um so so essentially

1428
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,799
uh this seems like a better pattern for

1429
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:57,599
for for burst traffic and if you go to

1430
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,599
the final slide

1431
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,559
so what we sort of discovered was uh

1432
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,118
sort of to summarize a little bit that

1433
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,400
if you have

1434
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,280
uniform random traffic it makes sense to

1435
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,760
try to

1436
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,119
minimize the distance to your repair in

1437
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,680
order to minimize

1438
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:16,160
the latency at the decoder but if you

1439
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,240
have bursty traffic like a video feed

1440
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,359
coming from a camera for example

1441
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:25,598
it actually makes more sense to make the

1442
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:28,799
uh sort of the the um the coding

1443
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:31,359
follow the bursts of the traffic uh

1444
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:34,319
in order to maximize the protection of

1445
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:35,440
the symbols that you're transporting um

1446
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:38,160
and if you want to read a little bit

1447
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,960
more about it we we wrote some stuff

1448
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:41,279
about it on

1449
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,680
both in some documentation for one of

1450
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,520
our coding libraries but also

1451
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,359
on our blog where we talk about

1452
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,359
something called we call content aware

1453
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,359
coding which is really

1454
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:53,119
if you if you know something about the

1455
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:54,558
structure of the content that you're

1456
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,400
protecting

1457
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,720
you can utilize that knowledge in your

1458
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,960
fec scheme to actually

1459
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,959
make the best possible protection and

1460
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,960
and you have to do that if you want to

1461
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,480
get the best possible protection

1462
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,079
and if you want to get in touch with me

1463
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,760
you can reach me on my email or you can

1464
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:13,039
visit our website which also

1465
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:15,920
has some links to contact us and from

1466
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,640
further discussions but yeah so just

1467
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,280
wanted to

1468
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,118
to share this observation because it

1469
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,680
sort of surprised us a little bit

1470
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:24,960
uh when doing the work that that

1471
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,440
actually uh

1472
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,960
we were sort of off in in our

1473
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,799
understanding of what was the best

1474
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:32,079
repair pattern and the best way to use

1475
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,680
the fvc

1476
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,119
so thank you very much for your

1477
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,799
attention

1478
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,039
thank you martin for this presentation

1479
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:43,599
yes it's quite interesting because it's

1480
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:46,720
more complex than what we would think

1481
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:49,760
deciding how to to split uh interleave

1482
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,558
all those repair packets with the source

1483
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,640
flow

1484
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:53,839
source flows there might be several

1485
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,759
flaws as well

1486
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,880
it's not that trivial so very

1487
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,720
interesting

1488
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,160
we are running short of time sorry for

1489
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,759
that

1490
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:06,960
we are obliged to to

1491
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:10,240
very quickly uh stop this

1492
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:14,640
session but i

1493
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,640
suggest we continue on the mailing list

1494
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:22,078
do you want to add something major

1495
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,078
or anybody else

1496
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,240
i'm sorry my my audio was off no

1497
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:32,319
i think it's a good idea to continue uh

1498
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,399
for sure on the mailing list

1499
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:35,680
especially as regards the uh the open

1500
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,960
documents

1501
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,440
again thank you morton for the

1502
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,599
presentation um and yeah we're going to

1503
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,920
be cut off in one minute so uh

1504
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,200
i guess not i'm fully awake i don't know

1505
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,440
i don't know what what do you do in

1506
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,480
montreal at 3 30 in the morning

1507
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,119
if anybody has a an idea um maybe i'll

1508
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:55,520
just

1509
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:57,039
read something thank you

1510
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,559
thank you everybody so yes let's

1511
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:00,799
continue we have uh

1512
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,960
quite a few important questions to

1513
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,599
address on the list uh regarding the

1514
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,839
views

1515
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:09,839
documents and calls in particular

1516
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,839
bye everyone have a great day

1517
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,079
you
