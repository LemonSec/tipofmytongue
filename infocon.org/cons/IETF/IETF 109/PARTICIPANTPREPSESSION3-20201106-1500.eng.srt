but we'll also cover just generally how

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,480
medico

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
works and what you need to do to have

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,398
the

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
best experience during itf 109 with me

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,799
to go

23
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,479

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,360
um and i will be trying to keep an eye

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,439
on chat but i may miss something

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,720
uh but we'll pause throughout the

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,679
throughout the session

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,479
uh as i want to note that the session is

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
being recorded

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,520
so uh um

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
maybe this one or maybe one other of the

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,798
testing sessions will be

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,640
posted to the youtube channel for people

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,000
who aren't able to make

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,400
to the session in real time um

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,159
you should be seeing a slide uh that

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,240
shows what we'll cover today but

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
um we're a small group and um i think

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,679
we'll have plenty of time so if you have

41
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,720
questions along the way please

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
um you can just use the raise hand

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
icon which uh you should see just below

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
your name it looks like a hand with

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
little up arrows next to it

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
and um that'll put you in the queue and

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,320
then and then we can go from there

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,479
you will also you are also able to just

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,398
enable your audio and video at any time

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
so just so you know that if you click on

51
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,640
those you will immediately start sending

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,959
audio

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,560
or video so um

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,840
with that we'll just get right into it

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,720
um you can see that uh we are having

56

84
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,040
times for

85
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,800
questions um one thing i do want to say

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,359
is that at the end if any of you are

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,239
sharing or expect to present during a

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
session

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
i would encourage you strongly to test

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
sharing your desktop

91
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,440
if that's part of the plan but also

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
to make sure that you coordinate with

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,599
your

94
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
chairs or co-chairs or participants

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,839
to make sure you understand the plan on

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
the day because

97
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
you'll need to make sure that the

98
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,000
content is all ready and

99
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
set up properly to to share uh most most

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,480
efficiently during the session

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,080
so uh with that uh as i mentioned we had

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,119
five testing sessions we will be posting

103
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
recordings of

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
a couple of the sessions to the youtube

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
channel and i'll send out a note so that

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,720
um people will know where to find them

107
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,000
uh we also have web pages that are

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,439
guides for

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
uh both session chairs and participants

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
and

111
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,518
links to the recordings will be posted

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,200
there in addition we have

113
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,920
um uh just a general guide about

114
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
medico that's been updated to to talk

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,958
about some of the features that are new

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
this time around

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
and if you're a chair there's a chair

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
checklist actually that you can find on

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
the

120
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
session chair guide that can help you

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
just make sure you have everything set

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,320
up

123
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,880
in advance and uh during the session to

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,800
make your

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,040
uh chairing run as smoothly as possible

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:38,320
um so that's that's what we have today

127
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,840
during itf 109

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,080
week we will also have um

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,359
testing session open 30 minutes before

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,880
the meeting sessions

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,639
and 30 minutes after the meeting

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,199
sessions each day

133
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,000
so in case you wanted to jump uh drop in

134
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
and just

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
test on the day you're you're gonna be

136
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,440
free to do that before the sessions

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,360
start

138
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,919
and for chairs if you would like to

139
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,120
double check your setup or just test it

140
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,840
again with

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,560
your co-chair or presenters we will have

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,880
slots

143
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,120
as we did with 108 we'll have slots

144
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,000
during the week that you can schedule

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,600
30 minutes to test in the chair roll so

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
you can see exactly how those controls

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,360
work

148
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
so those will be both of those things

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
will be available during

150
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,800
during the meeting week itself um

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,440
yeah so uh a little bit about medical

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,440
requirements

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,039
obviously you're in the session so you

154
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,639
uh have have

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,440
met the requirements uh but generally

156
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,400
medical is a webrtc based application so

157
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
you need a webrtc enabled browser

158
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
it does work to some extent on mobile

159
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,520
browsers but it's best

160
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,280
used via a desktop

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,520
browser um we're expecting that it'll be

162
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
that there'll be three or four videos

163
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,199
being sent or shared at once during any

164
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,080
particular session

165
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,039
and so that'll require about a megabit

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,599
or two megabits

167
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,960
of uh internet connection uh to make

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,240
that work smoothly

169
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
um yeah so i think that's

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
i think that's it for the requirements

171
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
i'll talk a little bit about the

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
session flow joining sessions again

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,240
everybody is joined here so you've

174
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,520
you've experienced it

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,880
generally you do need a you do need an

176
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
ietf data tracker

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,080
login to join a session and the great

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
thing about that is that when you

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,159
join a session uh your presence is tied

180
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,039
to the data tracker

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,840
account and therefore um the blue sheets

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,680
the attendance

183
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,280
records for that session can be

184
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
generated automatically

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
and if you're a chair that means you

186
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
don't have to do anything to generate

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
your blue sheets

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
it just it just happens automatically

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,758
and i see i see paul on thecube paul

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,759
please go ahead

191
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,840
can you hear me yes okay

192
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,960
um i was just wondering you said the the

193
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,198
data tracker

194
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,280
you know account you know i'm a chair i

195
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,599
have i've had that for a long time

196
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,479
but for general members people that just

197
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,599
sign up to come to a meeting do they

198
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,360
automatically get a data tracker account

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah i think as part of the registration

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
process for the meeting

201
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
um they will be prompted to create a

202
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
data tracker account if they

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,479
don't already have one yes so if you

204
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,880
register for the meeting

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,560
successfully uh you should end up at the

206
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
end of that process with a data tracker

207
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
account that can

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
that you can use to join the meeting

209
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,318
sessions

210
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,880
okay thank you yeah no problem good

211
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,280
question

212
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,560
thank you um a few nuances about the

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,799
the data tracker account uh another

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,639
feature of it is that um if you are the

215
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
designated chair for a session

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
that means when you log in to join the

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,318
session

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
uh you will automatically have the chair

219
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
role in medico

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
and that means that you can do the chair

221
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,280
things like share your screen without

222
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,400
without asking permission

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,758
yeah paul okay that was the other

224
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
question i was waiting to ask about

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,680
waiting for the right time

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,719
um is there any way

227
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,759
for chairs to test

228
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,120
using the chair rule without there being

229
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,720
a session that

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,199
you without until the session comes up

231
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
yeah as i mentioned um uh we did have

232
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,399
two testing

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,519
sessions for chairs previously yeah uh

234
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,919
but for the

235
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
specific chair role um we will have

236
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,838
these schedulable

237
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,439
slots throughout itf meeting week and

238
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,920
we'll send a note out to the working

239
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,600
group chairs or the session chairs

240
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,160
so that they can sign up for those slots

241
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,240
and then they can log into medico

242
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
using a special code that will allow

243
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,440
them to join that

244
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
test session as in the chair role and

245
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,120
then they can do anything they want uh

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,880
as chair okay

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
yes yeah okay so what you're saying is

248
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,640
that there

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
there will be you can request a test

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
session

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,439
during the week the practice ahead is

252
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,240
that what you're saying

253
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
that's right that's right okay so

254
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,839
there's no way

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,880
no way to do that before before meeting

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,120
week

257
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,320
yeah you know actually um we hadn't

258
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
thought about that um

259
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,240
or or hadn't planned for that but i'll

260
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
i'll ask i'll talk to the medical folks

261
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,760
and see if we can set up like a

262
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,600
a day uh the week before ietf meeting

263
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,040
week to test

264
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,720
so this isn't something that they can

265
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,839
just have permanently

266
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,279
running somewhere that

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,279
people couldn't use on demand yeah no uh

268
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
well that's exactly what happens that

269
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,560
during the meeting week is that it is

270
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,880
just running constantly and used

271
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,000
people can use it on demand the trick is

272
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,000
that um

273
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,920
because those test sessions aren't tied

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
to a data tracker

275
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,040
and we use when we use a token to join

276
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
in

277
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,640
the chair role it's um you just want to

278
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,079
avoid collisions so you do need to

279
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,760
schedule

280
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,839
uh yeah okay that's the trick

281
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
yeah thanks good question and i'll uh

282
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
i'll ask uh

283
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,519
well we have someone for me to go here

284
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,359
on the on on the

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
call so they'll also take it but i'll

286
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
ask um

287
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,760
let me just take a note

288
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:34,720
and i see al al please go ahead

289
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,279
i seem to remember last time uh that we

290
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,480
had

291
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,760
the opportunity to schedule sessions uh

292
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,279
the weekend before and uh

293
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,040
you know uh i i i was i was able to do

294
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,920
that a lot easier than

295
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,599
uh at other times and it had more

296
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
relevance to whatever the state of my

297
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
machine was

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
in terms of updates and and things like

299
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,040
that

300
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,279
so um and that was very helpful for the

301
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,120
uh for those of us who had a monday

302
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,800
morning session going

303
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,959
so um um i i would

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
i would i hope that we can we can get

305
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,959
some extra

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,720
uh time to to do the testing uh there

307
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,160
were some tricks that i found last time

308
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
that were very helpful

309
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,760
and uh you know some of the some of the

310
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,120
landscape may have changed so

311
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,120
i i'd just like to endorse

312
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,680
the idea that we get a little time

313
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
before the meeting week that would be

314
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,519
great

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,200
thank you yeah okay a point taken

316
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,760
okay and i am i'm 99 sure it's possible

317
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
so

318
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,040
um we'll make that happen um one note uh

319
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
that you're allowing me to point out

320
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,360
right now al is that when you stop

321
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,279
if you want to stop sending audio you

322
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,920
you do need to click the

323
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,800
microphone again um to stop the audio

324
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
stream and that's

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,359
the kind of the way all the media

326
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,360
buttons work is that you start the

327
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
stream and then you stop the stream

328
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,399
um or you enter the queue and you and

329
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
you

330
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,680
remove yourself from the queue and as

331
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,560
chair i can remove remove

332
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,199
remove you from the queue or stop your

333
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
stream

334
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,079
um so uh and we'll go through that a

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,600
little bit more detail

336
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,040
um we talked about joining

337
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,240
the sessions um and the fact that you

338
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,760
can join as a chair

339
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,160
to the sessions you're sharing because

340
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,600
of the data tracker login

341
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,839
and we had some questions are there any

342
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,959
other questions before i move along

343
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
yes please go ahead i see ah okay

344
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,200
great um well i don't i don't see any um

345
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
for the question so we'll just what

346
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,079
we'll do is we'll start a tour

347
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,279
ah yes please uh okay uh

348
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,000
someone's testing out the buttons it

349
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,560
looks like which is great um

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
so what we'll do is we'll uh go through

351
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,800
the

352
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,439
general flow of the uh or just a flow

353
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,920
around

354
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,360
a tour of the medico interface and again

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,479
some things have changed

356
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,480
uh uh many of these things seem familiar

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
or might look familiar but to do this

358
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,279
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

359
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,279
share my medical window

360
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
in midiko so you'll get a sort of a

361
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,680
recursive view of

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,120
uh it'll look a little odd but it's um

363
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,800
uh

364
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,720
it's easiest to see what's going on that

365
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,000
way i think um

366
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,320
and a note here is that you

367
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,320
you need to have you can only share one

368
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
desktop or one screen at a time

369
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,680
so and you actually need to stop screen

370
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
sharing before you start

371
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,479
the next screen sharing so i've stopped

372
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,760
my screen sharing and i'll

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,040
pick my medical window to share um and i

374
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,079
also say that while i well i think of it

375
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,880
um that uh sharing is

376
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,079
um behaviors are um browser dependent so

377
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,279
depending on what browser you

378
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,479
you are choosing to use you'll encounter

379
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,279
slight differences

380
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,240
um and also os dependent

381
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,199
so in firefox and i think in chrome you

382
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,560
can share individual application windows

383
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,479
but in safari on mac os you have to

384
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,079
share your entire screen so it's not

385
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,120
possible to choose an individual window

386
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,479
it's

387
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,320
something you can manage for sure

388
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,800
depending by arranging your windows but

389
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
um just something to know ahead of time

390
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,680
and a good reason to start

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,240
to practice sharing before you before

392
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,079
you start a session

393
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,480
yeah so um here we see my

394
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,638
medical window and you can see up in the

395
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,920
left hand corner the itf logo

396
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,240
just below that you can see my um uh

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
picture and my name and the role that

398
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
i'm

399
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,160
in this session as the picture is taken

400
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,760
from your data tracker profile so

401
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
if you'd like to have a picture next to

402
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,240
your name while you're using medico

403
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,920
the best thing to do is to request a

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
picture be added to your data tracker

405
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,079
profile and you can do that by

406
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,439
emailing ietf action

407
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,638
at ietf.org and um

408
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
if there isn't a profile picture in data

409
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
tracker

410
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,359
people will um uh

411
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,680
the medica will look for a picture in

412
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,880
the gravatar service which is a

413
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,760
widely used service um by different

414
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
online applications

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
below my name uh in my picture you can

416
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,120
see that there are is this

417
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
indication that i'm speaking and i just

418
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,160
learned the other day that this is

419
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,360
actually the waveform

420
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,399
uh so you can kind of tell your level uh

421
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
by this waveform

422
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,560
in terms of audio um there are other

423
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,160
indications about who's speaking and

424
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,479
i'll talk about those as well but this

425
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,279
is

426
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
this you only see your own waveform uh

427
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,600
just next to that is the raised hand

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,120
which

429
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,920
puts you in the queue and you can see

430
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,160
that there is a

431
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,759
section in the participant list column

432
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,880
that shows the cue

433
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,160
and people are added to that uh

434
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,560
in uh in the order that they um

435
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,040
uh asked to enter the queue and um

436
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
uh you can take your hand down by

437
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,399
clicking that

438
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,519
uh same button which has got the tooltip

439
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,079
leave queue there

440
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
next to that is the shares screen

441
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,160
sharing

442
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,719
button and again it's a

443
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,000
sort of a toggle where if you're sharing

444
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
your screen at the moment

445
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
clicking it will stop the share and you

446
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
can

447
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,880
tell where it is by the color of the

448
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,839
icon if it's blue that means you are

449
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,439
sharing that media stream if it's gray

450
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
means you are not sharing and there is

451
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
also a

452
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
shape indication uh with the square is

453
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
like a stop button

454
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,480
or a triangle for sort of a play button

455
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,160
for each media stream

456
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,519
we have video here and um same

457
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,160
same deal a video starts and stops

458
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,920
and you can control that at any time so

459
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,240
even as a participant

460
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
who isn't in the queue you can start

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,680
sending video

462
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,880
and the same with audio so you don't

463
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,040
need to actually be in the queue or

464
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,040
recognized by the chair

465
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,359
to start either of those media streams

466
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,799
you do need to have there is the uh

467
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,520
the chair does control the screen

468
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,599
sharing however

469
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,959
so then moving into the upper right uh

470
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,520
you can see this is the presentation

471
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
view

472
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,359
um this shows the screen being shared

473
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,520
and

474
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,039
then the videos being shared along the

475
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,679
right side of it

476
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,520
um the gallery review just shows the

477
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,839
videos being shared so it doesn't show

478
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,720
this

479
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,600
the screen's being shared and if you

480
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
have

481
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,879
multiple video streams that you want to

482
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,159
see it

483
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,640
in a larger view and you have the

484
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,600
materials being shared maybe or in a

485
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
separate view

486
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,120
or a separate browser window then you

487
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,679
can use that view

488
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,280
the note-taking tool so the taking tool

489
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,480
is linked as it has been before to the

490
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,000
kodi md

491
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,640
notepad for the session and so um

492
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
you can see that you can open this

493
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,919
inside

494
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
the medical window and this is this this

495
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,520
is the notepad

496
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,120
linked to this session so each session

497
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,879
has its own notepad

498
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,239
um and new for this time around is you

499
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
can actually open

500
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,360
uh the code emd notepad in a separate

501
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
tab

502
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,559
and then you can tear that tab off if

503
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,799
you like so um

504
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,320
that's pretty slick um and then you can

505
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
go back to the present

506
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,439
to the presentation view if you want to

507
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,120
track the materials

508
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,480
there um next to that is the folder

509
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,719
which is the meeting materials and again

510
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
this is linked to data tracker so that

511
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
if there were meeting materials or

512
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
agenda

513
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,199
for this session then you would be able

514
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,960
to see them

515
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
here there are there are none of those

516
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,840
for this session so they don't appear

517
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,200
but

518
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,959
for every session during the meeting

519
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,440
the materials and data tracker will show

520
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,120
up you can find them just by using this

521
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,919
um button here um information is a quick

522
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,918
tour the eye the small eye in case you

523
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,679
need a reminder about

524
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,280
medico controls and then next to that is

525
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,520
a notification setting if you want

526
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,240
audible settings for

527
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,840
either new media streams being shared or

528
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,799
new chat

529
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:14,080
messages you can find that there

530
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,600
then uh in settings uh you can actually

531
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,520
this is also new for this time you can

532
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,399
change the input devices for your audio

533
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,799
in your

534
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,919
video um i don't i don't have any but

535
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,760
a single option in this system so uh

536
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,320
it doesn't uh doesn't apply to me but um

537
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,640
then the last the last bit is that the

538
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,240
um you have to leave the room

539
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
door so if you click on that you'll

540
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
you'll be asked if you

541
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,880
really do want to leave and if you say

542
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,799
yes then you will leave the medical

543
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,559
session

544
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,480
so with that i'm just going to pause and

545
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:53,840
see if there are any questions about

546
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,840
any of those things

547
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,918
uh nicholas please go ahead

548
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,360
you'll need to click on the audio

549
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,159
uh send audio button up here in the

550
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,158
upper left

551
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:13,600
great fantastic can you hear me

552
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,720
yes okay cool so that answers my first

553
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,520
question

554
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
excellent and second the question i had

555
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,280
was

556
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,559
from the notepad uh if this one will be

557
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,039
the one that will be used during the

558
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:28,399
meetings for not taking

559
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,559
correct yes yes okay and

560
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,200
um the slides will be shown by the

561
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,399
chairs as usual or

562
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,480
yes yes the slides should be um

563
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,679
displayed by the chairs or if the chair

564
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,640
decides to have

565
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,760
a presenter um display or share their

566
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,720
own desktop

567
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,360
then uh that's how that'll be managed so

568
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
it'd be

569
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,719
through this um screen sharing button

570
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,880
here

571
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,960
okay and the meeting material will be

572
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,440
uploaded directly on the folder i can

573
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,440
see here

574
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,360
uh i'm sorry i missed part of that

575
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,200
um the meeting material will be

576
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,559
uploaded by the chairs before the

577
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
meeting

578
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
yes as they usually do it'll they'll be

579
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,000
uploaded to

580
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,840
the data tracker exactly yeah okay

581
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
perfect that answers on my question

582
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
thank you very much

583
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,239
thank you nicholas um paul please go

584
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,678
ahead

585
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,440
um a couple questions on this

586
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,679
when when you send audio

587
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,360
it's really just being it's being sent

588
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,919
to the server and the chair has to

589
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,719
enable it right

590
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,679
uh no when you send audio uh you can as

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,760
a participant send audio at any time

592
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,120
so this is a great question both audio

593
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,840
and video are

594
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,520
entirely in the control uh sending it is

595
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,959
entirely in the control

596
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
of um the participants so you can think

597
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,720
of it as

598
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,080
like if you have a meeting room mental

599
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,760
model uh

600
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,918
people can come to the microphone and be

601
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,840
recognized to speak in the queue

602
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,640
um or they can stand up in the middle

603
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,840
room and

604
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
middle of the room and just start

605
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,360
speaking uh either option is available

606
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,679
to the

607
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,639
participant of course it's preferred

608
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,320
that

609
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
they come to the queue and be recognized

610
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,240
just to keep discussion manageable but

611
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,520
um sending audio or video is entirely in

612
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,440
the

613
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,639
control of the participants the chairs

614
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,919
do have the options

615
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,960
and i'll talk a little bit more about

616
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,960
that um to stop people from sending or

617
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,240
to stop their audio or video

618
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,360
okay so with audio it's all mixed

619
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,400
and what what happens with video do you

620
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
have multiple

621
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,120
thumbnails or something yeah please uh

622
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,960
if anybody would like to send video

623
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,719
in fact i would encourage you to do that

624
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,280
um i think we

625
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
are configured to send up to 20

626
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,240
simultaneous

627
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,520
videos and so uh everybody

628
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,320
who wants to in this session should be

629
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
able to send video

630
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,120
so presumably if there's there's a

631
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,559
hundred of people said in video

632
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,600
we aren't going to see them all uh

633
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,879
yes uh there well there are um there are

634
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,879
limits

635
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,400
set up hey good to see everybody i'm

636
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,200
stay right there for a moment if i could

637
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,280
ask you to

638
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,039
excellent i'm just going to show the

639
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,120
gallery view so this is what the gallery

640
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,720
if you click on the gallery view button

641
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,439
you can see the gallery view and you

642
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,799
don't get to see the shared desktop

643
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,200
or screen but you do get to see

644
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
everybody in a little slightly larger

645
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,880
and to your question paul about the

646
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,879
number of videos that can be shared

647
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,880
um yeah the limit there are limits set

648
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
uh on the server and the number of video

649
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
streams um and i think

650
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,120
the default is going to be somewhere

651
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,559
around 20.

652
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,719
uh and so i think in typical

653
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,399
uh sessions what will happen is that

654
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,840
because it does require bandwidth for

655
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,279
each participant

656
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,120
uh as additional videos are streamed

657
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,720
um i think the typical typical

658
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,639
way of working will be that chairs will

659
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,720
share video and anybody

660
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,320
uh presenting will share a video or

661
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,679
maybe anybody in the queue will

662
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,439
share video uh but um in general

663
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,880
participants will not share video

664
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:27,039
um okay regarding the notepad

665
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,840
uh it's just a dedicated notepad

666
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,840
for the session

667
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,918
whether the chairs choose to use it as

668
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
the official notes for the session i

669
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,039
presume is up to the chairs

670
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,120
you know if they want to take their

671
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,120
notes some other way

672
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,360
you know or designate a scribe that

673
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,399
takes the notes some other way

674
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,959
that's their business right yeah yeah

675
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,919
exactly

676
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,279
uh this is exactly the um notepad that

677
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,799
is linked from

678
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:57,120
um the data tracker

679
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,918
entry for the data tracker agenda entry

680
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,918
for this session

681
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,400
so uh it's it's usable or not

682
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,400
exactly the same way that that that

683
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,799
notepad and data tracker agenda is

684
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,799
usable

685
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,080
okay thank you

686
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,200
great thanks yes hi

687
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,080
i would like to know please uh how we do

688
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
to assign to someone the role of chair

689
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,559
sorry it's not really with these

690
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,320
settings probably the question because

691
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,520
they're going to say can you assign me

692
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,279
the chair wall but i

693
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,440
i could not do that i don't know

694
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,039
how to do it and if of course i think

695
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,600
there is no limit of the amount of

696
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,640
chairs

697
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,000
i mean two at least or three it's fine

698
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,679
yeah yeah so

699
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
uh and i'm looking for um

700
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,799
to be it to correct me if i'm wrong but

701
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,039
by default

702
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,039
if you are a chair for a session the the

703
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,480
designated chair for a session

704
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,240
during the meeting week when you join

705
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,200
that session using your data tracker

706
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,320
account

707
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
you will join us chair oh okay

708
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,120
cool will know that you are the chair

709
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,760
for the session so you will have the

710
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,039
chair role

711
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,158
in medico there are some other

712
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,879
uh people like responsible ads

713
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,840
for a session or i think for irtf

714
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,960
sessions the irtf chair

715
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,240
who will also have superpowers if you

716
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,279
will

717
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,720
but otherwise

718
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,159
i think it's possible to designate

719
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,000
chairs but

720
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,720
by default it'll be the chairs in

721
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,559
the designated chairs for the session

722
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,640
that will join as chairs automatically

723
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,799
so you won't have to do anything

724
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,799
okay thank you very much no problem

725
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,719
um paul please go ahead um

726
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,559
when you said you talked about chairs

727
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,240
for the session

728
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,080
but i i didn't even know there was a

729
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
notion of a chair for a session distinct

730
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,279
from a chair from a work group is

731
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,240
is there a distinction uh well no that's

732
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,840
what i meant i mean for

733
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,400
avery um uh for every

734
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,840
working group session the chairs for

735
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,880
that working group

736
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,279
um designated chairs

737
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,799
the only reason i use chair and a

738
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,440
session chair instead of working group

739
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,600
chair

740
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,039
is because there are also research

741
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,879
groups

742
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,200
and so there are chairs of the research

743
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
groups who will also join as chair for

744
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,640
their session

745
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,639
yes great

746
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,240
i'm trying to see i see there's chap i'm

747
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,640
ah

748
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,320
good test chat chat chat message work so

749
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,320
great all good questions thank you for

750
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,960
asking them um

751
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,520
and i think we've uh hopefully covered

752
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,840
some

753
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,200
uh questions about sharing a session too

754
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,439
so that's great

755
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
um i'm going to continue the tour but

756
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,640
we'll we'll

757
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,080
pause again so um if we pick up in the

758
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
lower right hand corner

759
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,320
you can see there's a sort of a circular

760
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,520
button

761
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,279
uh arrows spinning arrows icon and

762
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
if you have trouble with your audio uh

763
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,600
it's often helpful to just um

764
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,559
uh re-reconnect using that button and i

765
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,760
see susan as

766
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,039
uh sue is testing out the private chat

767
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,679
feature which is great and we'll talk

768
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,000
about that some more later

769
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:29,200
um the toggle audio is just a mute

770
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,679
uh unmute button for the medico session

771
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
and

772
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,200
next to is the local volume slider

773
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,080
you can see the recording indicator and

774
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,080
then um

775
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,240
sort of the bitstream so you can tell

776
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,000
what kind of uh

777
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,120
bit streams your your audio is sending

778
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
and then uh the medico logo in the lower

779
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,959
left

780
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,600
and i'm gonna hop right into the um this

781
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,720
stack of um here with the with the

782
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,719
participants

783
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,240
um so the first thing you'll notice is

784
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,679
that this

785
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,399
participant list here

786
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
includes the feature when you mouse over

787
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,760
there's the options

788
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,760
open a private chat with someone so

789
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,520
i'll open the chat with sue and right

790
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
back

791
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,000
uh so this is a private chat window that

792
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,080
just you and

793
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,600
and sue can see unless you're sharing

794
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,720
your media code desktop in which case

795
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,559
everybody can

796
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,080
meet a go window in case everybody sees

797
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,918
it

798
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,279
so that's just a private chat feature

799
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,159
and we'll talk a little bit more about

800
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,159
the group chat

801
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,720
so above the participants are the chairs

802
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,840
and here is as a pretty straightforward

803
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,520
it's just a chair

804
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,279
and above the chairs is the queue and we

805
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,840
talked a little bit before already about

806
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,760
how

807
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,000
people are put in the queue in the order

808
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,158
in which they uh

809
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
join the queue and the queue can be

810
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,960
managed by

811
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,640
um the chairs so um

812
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,880
you may have seen when other people

813
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,840
joined the queue their the hand have

814
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,559
from my view anyway had a little orange

815
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,480
x

816
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,000
so it's possible for me as chair to

817
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,840
remove people from the queue

818
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,520
it's also possible for me as chair to

819
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,799
control um

820
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:22,080
people's to stop people's

821
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,639
audio or video streams

822
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,840
and as chair i need to grant people

823
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
permission

824
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:33,039
uh to send uh to share their

825
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,439
screens so screen sharing is by request

826
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,158
and one of the things the chair can do

827
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,360
is either accept or deny the request

828
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,360
and again if you are looking to have a

829
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,000
new person share the screen

830
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,678
um you need to stop any screen that's

831
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,039
already being shared so you can only

832
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,360
share one screen at a time

833
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,720
uh one chair feature you'll see here and

834
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,399
this because my view is that

835
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,320
chairs can mute groups of people at once

836
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,039
and this might be helpful in case there

837
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,439
are people who are

838
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,200
not in the queue uh but have left their

839
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,240
microphone open or open their microphone

840
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,519
by example

841
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,720
so this um mute all meets everybody but

842
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,159
the chairs

843
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,200
so uh that includes people in the queue

844
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,360
and the people who uh if you just want

845
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,320
to mute people who are not in the queue

846
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,519
you can use um the mute audience button

847
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,480
instead

848
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,840
uh it's possible for that multiple

849
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,840
multiple people to have

850
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,080
um send audio at once as we as we saw um

851
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,199
so it could be the case that you would

852
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,799
like to have

853
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,480
or people are in the queue and having a

854
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,639
back and forth discussion that's easier

855
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,360
for them to just leave their audio on

856
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,159
so it's it's uh it could be the case

857
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,639
that you have

858
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,480
two or three people in the queue having

859
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,159
a back and forth discussion that you

860
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,519
just leave all their audio on but you'd

861
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,720
like to mute the rest of the people who

862
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,120
are not in the queue

863
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,840
and so that's what this does

864
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,600
great well um i think we're we're

865
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,600
getting to the excite the really

866
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,760
exciting part here it's all good but

867
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,199
um this is the participant list you can

868
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,840
see the number of participants as

869
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,760
indicated here and this view

870
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,519
shows the participants the next tab over

871
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,559
is the chat panel

872
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,279
and uh there are a few new features here

873
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,158
um the first one is that it's possible

874
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,880
to open the

875
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,880
detach the chat this is one of the most

876
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,320
requested things that we had

877
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,480
of after 108. so if you click on that

878
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,519
your chat panel should open in a new

879
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,240
browser window separate from the medical

880
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,720
main media

881
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,360
browser window so that it's possible to

882
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,120
look at the

883
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,120
keep tabs of the participant list

884
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,678
and then have a separate window for chat

885
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,360
onenote which is great as you can see

886
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,000
here that i have opened a separate

887
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
browser window

888
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,360
you can't see it i have opened this up

889
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,360
the chat in a separate browser window

890
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,760
but i don't it does not have focus so

891
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,799
i'm my focus is here

892
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,039
uh on the main medica window and even if

893
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,559
i

894
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,720
can see the open browser window

895
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,320
if it doesn't have focus and i'm not

896
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,080
looking at the chat panel i'll get an

897
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,240
indication

898
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,519
that there's a new chat to see and

899
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,000
that's because that

900
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,880
separate chat window might be covered by

901
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,039
other windows

902
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,960
so you can just see here that once i

903
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,760
apply focus to this

904
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
chat tab or even if i just apply focus

905
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
to the

906
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,519
detached chat panel the notification

907
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,880
will go away

908
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,600
so uh then the last element here in this

909
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,480
is the third tab which is a show of

910
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,760
hands

911
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,960
um uh the show of hands tool

912
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,760
is um new

913
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,080
you may have remembered the experimental

914
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,240
hum

915
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,399
tool from it 108 the feedback that we

916
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,000
got was that

917
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,799
that wasn't as useful this show of hands

918
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
tool is

919
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,039
a specification taken from the shmu

920
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,519
working group so if you have thoughts

921
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,040
about it um it's a it's a draft

922
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
that's being discussed in the schmoo

923
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,320
working group um

924
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,839
and i'm just going to run through a few

925
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
examples to show how this works because

926
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,639
this might be something especially as a

927
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,399
chair that you

928
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,440
would like to use um uh the show of

929
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,598
hands tool

930
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,200
allows the indication it's the idea is

931
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,040
to sort of replicate

932
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,879
uh the in-person situation where you

933
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,480
want to have people raise hands

934
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,960
in response to a question um so a common

935
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,280
question

936
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,159
in a working group session is have you

937
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
read

938
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,079
the draft and

939
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,879
as a chair you can type in a question

940
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,520
here you don't need to but you can

941
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,118
and then you can start the session and

942
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,960
then you'll see that as chair ns

943
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,000
participant

944
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,839
you have the option to either

945
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,199
affirmatively raise your hand to

946
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,560
affirmatively

947
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,960
not raise your hand or to simply

948
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,680
do nothing if you decide to do something

949
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
then

950
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,359
you definitely do have to do something

951
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,520
you can't

952
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,119
raise your hand and then decide you

953
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,560
don't want to do anything

954
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,560
you can you can raise your hand

955
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
you can change it too you do not want to

956
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,680
raise your hand

957
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,359
which is sort of an indication that you

958
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,160
have heard the question

959
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,160
uh but you don't want to raise your hand

960
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,839
and you can change back and forth so

961
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,319
it's possible to change back and forth

962
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,880
while the session is open and you can

963
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,880
see from the results here um

964
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,040
that people can

965
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,160
do both so we have it looks like we have

966
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,359
about eight people who have heard the

967
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,480
question and are changing their

968
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,920
responses

969
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,200
and there are three people because there

970
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,560
are eleven participants so there are

971
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,759
three people who've decided they're just

972
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,440
not gonna

973
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,800
they they haven't even either haven't

974
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,839
heard or they're not gonna respond at

975
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,440
all

976
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,160
and then you yes that's right

977
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,760
john like i think the idea is and this

978
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
is in the specification which is the

979
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,320
ideas

980
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,599
if you've heard the question and you've

981
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,560
decided to respond

982
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,800
you can't unhear the question so you uh

983
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,520
you cannot raise your hand but you can't

984
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,200
have no opinion about it so

985
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,759
so as a chair i can i can end the

986
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,439
session and that's a snapshot in time of

987
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,640
what the results were so if people are

988
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,960
changing back and forth

989
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,319
when you end the session you'll take the

990
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,680
snapshot in time

991
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:30,880
and you'll see the results um

992
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,680
uh you another feature is

993
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,079
uh that you can have multiple questions

994
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,078
uh

995
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,200
this is a different question i should

996
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,079
point out that you should see an

997
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,240
indication

998
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,480
that um you have um

999
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,598
a new question to be asked in the in the

1000
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,160
raise hand raise a

1001
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,720
show of hands tool in your medical

1002
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,399
window

1003
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,240
which will prompt you to click over to

1004
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,280
that tab and then once you're in that

1005
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,078
tab you can

1006
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,440
make a choice or or not you can ignore

1007
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,520
it if you will

1008
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,280
i'm astounded that only six people are

1009
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,400
gonna stand up for chocolate here but

1010
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,440
uh okay um okay we got seven

1011
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,320
good enough uh and again i'll end the

1012
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,839
session

1013
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,599
and another new feature is that you can

1014
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,880
see the history of

1015
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,680
um the hand raises uh

1016
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,320
so this is also a change in uh behavior

1017
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,720
from

1018
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,160
the hum tool in that it's there's some

1019
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,799
uh there's some record of it here

1020
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:31,920
directly in the in the medico session

1021
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:37,839
so um any questions about the raise the

1022
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,839
hand tool

1023
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,280
i see paul paul please go ahead

1024
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,560
um are the results of the raised hands

1025
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,079
queries

1026
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,279
captured permanently you know it's part

1027
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,800
of the

1028
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
session recording or something

1029
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,520
yeah i i i don't know about that

1030
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,960
actually it's a good question

1031
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,480
um uh for sure

1032
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,760
uh i think the usual practice uh

1033
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,599
i actually i don't know what the usual

1034
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,760
practice is in terms of sharing

1035
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,880
um it could be recorded in in the

1036
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,000
in the uh notes

1037
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,400
i think usually in practice uh at least

1038
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,240
my

1039
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,000
uh observation is that usually what will

1040
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,279
happen is there'll be a call for a show

1041
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,480
of hands

1042
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,880
and then the chair will sort of

1043
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,839
summarize like oh it looks like most

1044
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,040
i think there are a couple of people who

1045
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,799
um

1046
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,240
have read the draft or it looks like

1047
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,599
there are a couple people who think that

1048
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,200
we should not work on this

1049
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,880
and if those people could come to the

1050
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,240
microphone so

1051
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,119
i will ask if there's a permanent

1052
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,160
recording uh in the medical

1053
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,400
recording i kind of think no but i'll

1054
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,399
ask

1055
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,839
okay great

1056
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,359
yeah yeah i um again uh

1057
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,000
first if there are um specific requests

1058
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:13,440
about the

1059
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,040
um tool itself for example automatically

1060
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,880
captured into the notepad

1061
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,320
uh that's um that's something to

1062
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,119
uh uh um

1063
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,800
bring up in the shmu working group i

1064
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,680
know that there have been

1065
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,280
conversations in the past about how how

1066
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,399
close we want to get to voting or not

1067
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,160
voting and

1068
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,520
raising hands might be perceived as

1069
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,118
voting so

1070
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,119
yeah al please go ahead

1071
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:48,000
i somehow missed um whether the

1072
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,760
whether the audience can see uh

1073
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,520
easily see the window where you're

1074
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
preparing the question

1075
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,119
uh that ends up uh finalized

1076
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,560
uh once you release the question for the

1077
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,680
hand-raising phase

1078
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,000
and as you know

1079
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,919
very often times there's some uh

1080
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,640
wordsmithing of the question that goes

1081
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,079
on

1082
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,078
uh before it uh before it gets asked

1083
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,560
um is it is it is it generally possible

1084
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,440
to display that with the

1085
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,040
with the tool um i i can't remember

1086
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,240
whether i saw that on the screen or not

1087
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,560
thanks i don't think

1088
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,359
it is displayed before it gets asked i

1089
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,759
don't think you

1090
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,520
you like the participants do not see the

1091
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,800
question as it's being typed in

1092
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,920
i don't believe so um

1093
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,440
uh but your your point is is uh well

1094
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,119
taken which is that

1095
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,079
there is some care uh some care pays off

1096
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,920
in terms of how you

1097
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,680
how you phrase the question that's being

1098
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,079
asked um

1099
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,720
even if this is true even in person if

1100
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,880
you're

1101
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,759
if you're like you said if you're asking

1102
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,520
a question

1103
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,720
uh phrasing is is uh

1104
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,680
is uh important and it probably pays to

1105
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,279
test out

1106
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:09,200
the phrasing uh before

1107
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,200
actually typing it into the tool so

1108
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,839
uh clipping it on a slide so that

1109
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,800
everybody can see it

1110
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,520
and then copying that into the uh into

1111
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
the dialog

1112
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,960
for the hand raising tool thank you yeah

1113
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,480
the slides or maybe in the group chat so

1114
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,480
that's that's a good tip for chairs

1115
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,640
i'll take that down maybe add it to the

1116
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,920
documentation

1117
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,440
great and again um this is a this is a

1118
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,839
specification that's being developed in

1119
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,079
the or being discussed anyway in in the

1120
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,200
schmidt working group so definitely

1121
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,200
encourage

1122
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,319
folks to chime in there if they have

1123
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,319
specific suggestions

1124
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:03,359
okay well uh that is the tour

1125
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,160
inez please go ahead

1126
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,640
i did not appear as a chair i supposed

1127
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,839
to

1128
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,118
i joined with the data tracker data

1129
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,078
but i i i think i was not chair assigned

1130
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,480
so

1131
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,760
because i understood that when we uh log

1132
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,880
in we are going to be

1133
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,319
in the chair role right but

1134
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,040
uh no sorry yes uh sorry for the

1135
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,520
confusion

1136
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,920
you are you appear as chair if you are

1137
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,759
designated a chair for that session in

1138
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,040
data tracker

1139
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,400
so um everybody in this session is

1140
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,640
uh designated as a participant

1141
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,040
okay participant says so yeah so it's

1142
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,078
not possible to log in via data tracker

1143
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,680
to join this session

1144
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:47,680
as a chair um

1145
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:01,040
yes okay and when we have this as a

1146
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,560
yeah okay and for example if the chairs

1147
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,400
have some kind of problems and we want

1148
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:06,720
to assign someone else for the

1149
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,240
participants as a general we cannot do

1150
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,959
that right

1151
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,520
yeah the chairs cannot designate uh

1152
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,359
chairs

1153
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,520
other chairs if uh if there's a problem

1154
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,520
in terms of um

1155
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,640
in the meeting during the session i

1156
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,640
think that medico

1157
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,400
will be monitoring the session so that

1158
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,440
they can jump in and help

1159
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,240
and possibly uh assist on that but in

1160
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,079
advance

1161
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,279
uh uh yeah it's not something that the

1162
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,240
chairs can do on their own

1163
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,680
that's right okay and for example when

1164
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,799
if we are going to do this

1165
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,879
test meeting for sharing uh we are going

1166
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,920
to be assigned as a chair right

1167
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,119
so we are okay thank you very much yeah

1168
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,119
no problem

1169
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,640
no problem yeah and just uh just to

1170
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,920
clarify that when you when we do the

1171
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,200
test session with chairs

1172
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,920
uh you will uh join

1173
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,960
as a uh chair because you'll have a

1174
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,520
special code

1175
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,760
and um for that session so that you can

1176
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,839
jump into that session and you'll

1177
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,839
join as chair it won't be by data

1178
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
tracker

1179
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,720
um well we're about a quarter before the

1180
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,440
hour

1181
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,720
um if there are no other questions about

1182
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
the medico

1183
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,160
interface at the moment what i would um

1184
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,839
uh

1185
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,839
suggest is anybody who thinks that they

1186
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,880
will have to share their screen

1187
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,319
uh during a session of itf 109 uh

1188
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,040
if you haven't already confirmed that

1189
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,880
your setup works to do that um

1190
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,560
uh i would strongly recommend that we

1191
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,119
take a moment to test that so i see

1192
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,560
bruno asking to share a screen so great

1193
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,119
i'm going to stop my screen and then

1194
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,680
bruno i will um

1195
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,119
i will allow you to share yours or grant

1196
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,359
your screen access and so what should

1197
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,640
happen is you will be

1198
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,640
prompted to um

1199
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,240
oh fantastic i see a beautiful picture

1200
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,240
of a beach

1201
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,079
so that works works great great and i

1202
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,839
see susan

1203
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,359
um so you can stop sharing your own

1204
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,359
screen bruno but i also can

1205
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,520
revoke it ah you did it on your own

1206
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:12,319
great now i see sue asking to share and

1207
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,440
i want

1208
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,759
i will click

1209
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,839
sue's button um you should be prompted

1210
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,839
to

1211
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,000
grant permission and there are some

1212
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,000
tricks if you're on mac os

1213
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,680
and you haven't shared your screen with

1214
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,040
me to go

1215
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,879
before you will need to go in

1216
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,480
to the system control panel and allow

1217
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,160
screen recording for the

1218
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:46,400
for the application for the browser

1219
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,240
so sue if you are running into issues

1220
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,839
you want to start audio to let us know

1221
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,879
what you're running into maybe

1222
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:57,040
can work through oh excellent

1223
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:00,079
well we see your browser window

1224
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,960
and great that seems working off

1225
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,960
the background going can you see the

1226
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,640
background as well

1227
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,040
no i just we just see your browser

1228
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040
window

1229
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,759
okay so i didn't share the whole screen

1230
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,040
i just shared the browser window

1231
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,480
let me try again okay uh

1232
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,680
i'll have to grab permission again if

1233
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,680
you stop so i think

1234
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,659
take

1235
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:30,659
[Music]

1236
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,319
it doesn't seem to it doesn't seem to

1237
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,040
want to share the entire screen it

1238
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,160
doesn't allow me to

1239
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,440
uh the share button is

1240
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,319
grey but it doesn't uh

1241
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
allow me to share it so is that a is

1242
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:54,240
that a chrome

1243
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,560
issue uh yes there's a

1244
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,839
if i recall correctly uh and i don't use

1245
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,720
chrome there are some

1246
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,359
tabs along the sharing that you need to

1247
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:05,040
click on

1248
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:08,240
i can i i've got a tab

1249
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,599
for entire screen and it simply will not

1250
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,279
share my entire screen yeah i think that

1251
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,319
might be a chrome issue

1252
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,359
um okay i can share the application

1253
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,558
window

1254
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:24,000
i can share the chrome tab window

1255
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,520
uh let me get something that's there's

1256
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,559

1257
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,680

but i cannot share my whole screen with

1259
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,279
chrome is that's that's something that's

1260
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,480
browser-based

1261
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,720
yeah i think the the screen sharing um

1262
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,559
details are definitely browser and os

1263
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,919

1264
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,960

1312
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,799

i won't have so much trouble with that

1316
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,079
as a chair speaking constantly

1317
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,000

1319
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,960

1320
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:39,119
screen and we'll go to dominique

1321
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,720
uh if you're sending video just to

1322
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,119
continue that thought if you're saying

1323
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,598
video you can also see in my video that

1324
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,400
there's a blue posting around the video

1325
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,200
so

1326
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,480
um that's helpful if you want to know

1327
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,439
who's speaking

1328
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,880
uh and and also like i said if if you're

1329
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,800
sending audio even if you're not

1330
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,160
speaking or you're sending media even if

1331
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,520
you're not speaking you have a green

1332
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,040
background so

1333
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,559
and we see what looks to be

1334
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,558
some very interesting charts

1335
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,440
experimental

1336
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,160
your audio dominique your audio sounds a

1337
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,400
little clipped and i can't tell if it's

1338
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,839
a

1339
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,839
problem on my end or your end

1340
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,279
yeah it sounds

1341
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,759
yeah i'm sorry the audio is very choppy

1342
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,119
it's difficult for me to understand so

1343
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,119

1364
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,759
um sue uh let's try it

1365
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,720
so this is the test to see if we can

1366
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,720
share the entire screen

1367
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:17,760
my mic is still okay yeah

1368
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,760
something something changed

1369
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,598
put an application screen um so it works

1370
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,200
i didn't get the whole screen i'll have

1371
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,880
to work on that

1372
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,399
okay thank you let us know if you run

1373
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,960
into any issues and

1374
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,760
uh we can help help with it uh but i

1375
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,640
know people have

1376
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,640
successfully shared

1377
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,599
well i don't know if they shared full

1378
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,399
screens with chrome before but i know

1379
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,559
they've shared

1380
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,319
various applications and windows within

1381
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,440
applications

1382
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,839
from previous tests so okay let me see

1383
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,839
what's going on

1384
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,558
okay

1385
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:58,078
yes okay john uh i don't know if john's

1386
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,319
still here

1387
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,640
yeah yeah that's exactly the magic thing

1388
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,640
in the max system preference yeah yeah

1389
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,160
it's not obvious but it is in the it is

1390
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,558
in the documentation so

1391
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,920
uh if you read the documentation uh we

1392
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,680
have screenshots there and everything to

1393
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,400
show exactly what you need to do

1394
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,240
there is one trick uh about the mac os

1395
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,359
thing which is that it's impossible

1396
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,839
apparently

1397
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:20,640
to grant permission to an application

1398
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,960
just

1399
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,680
for screen recording until it first

1400
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,440
tries

1401
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,040
to do so so it doesn't appear in the

1402
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,520
list of applications that you can pick

1403
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,079
to

1404
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,000
grant permission until it first tries so

1405
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,200
you actually have to fail first

1406
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,720
and then go and grab permission and then

1407
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,000
in mac os and then restart it and try it

1408
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,439
again and then

1409
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,359
once you do that then you're able to do

1410
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,319
it so if you're trying a new browser for

1411
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,520
example

1412
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:48,558
uh you have to fail at uh sharing the

1413
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,920
screen

1414
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,599
go into the mac os system preferences

1415
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,079
allow it to show the screen

1416
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,119
or to record the screen and then go back

1417
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,319
and restart the

1418
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,319
restart the browser so

1419
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,279
well we're about uh five minutes before

1420
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,040
the top of the hour

1421
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,799
thanks to everybody for testing things

1422
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:11,599
out uh i hope it

1423
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:13,359
really helps your itf meeting go more

1424
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,240
smoothly we'll follow up

1425
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,598
uh in terms of getting some chair

1426
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,799
testing sessions ahead

1427
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:25,680
of the meeting week possibly on the

1428
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:25,680

1429

great well thank you guys for joining um

1432
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,598
i want to make a plug for the itf

1433
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,040

1434
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:48,079
next uh in about three days

1435

uh it's uh free to participate in and

1436
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,480
if you i think there are 21 projects

1437
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,240
and over 200 people already

1438
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,240

uh if you want to help on uh or dive

1442
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,160

1443
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,119
it's um it's a great opportunity to try

1444
