half

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
we nearly adopted three drafts the vpn

83
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,800

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,120
funding and using geofeed data

86

and two existing drafts the l2 and m

87
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,600
and l3 nm are going well all of them are

88
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,720

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,280
comment and joe and hank do you have

91
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
anything to add

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,720
i i think the um i think alex clem

93
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,800
is acting a shepherd on ntf

94
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,320
as i recall or maybe it's yeah i think

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
it was ntf

96
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,800
um and we will be hearing from the l3

97
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,280
sm nm l2nm and the

98
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
common model um here uh we just adopted

99
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,880
geofeeds um

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,440
i i think randy commented that um the

101
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
submission queue had just closed uh but

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
but now that it reopened it's it's been

103
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,400
rebranded as a

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
an ops awg document

105
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
everything is up all of these slides

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
that you'll be seeing are up in data

107
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,039
tracker

108
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,080
there there is a ops area section at the

109
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,719
end of this

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,159
uh rob was telling me that they were a

111
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,919
little late in getting the slide so i

112
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,680
imagine if they have anything we'll

113
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,919
we'll get that up in data tracker as

114
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,479
well for you to look at

115
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:34,400

116
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,440

[Music]

140
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
uh the draft was recently adapted by the

141
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
working group after

142
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
several comments from both this working

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,960
group and dls working group

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,560
uh so in the last couple of revisions

145
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,478
we've been updating the draft to address

146
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
these comments so uh i'll be going over

147
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
these

148
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,838
uh major updates and uh taking any

149
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,838
further questions and comments next like

150
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
please

151
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,949
[Music]

152
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
one of the major comments that we got

153
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,240
from the tls working group was to not

154
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,680
include any uh tls

155
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,080
values which we were including in the

156
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
prior versions uh the main reason was

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
that

158
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,640
grease values are supposed to be used

159
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
for test purposes to test the

160
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
extensibility failures

161
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,399
uh in case if the peers are not able to

162
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,800
understand

163
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,519
the new parameters and start failing so

164
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,359
ah that's

165
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,120
that was one of the major comments that

166
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,959
for future extensibility we should not

167
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
be including uh grease parameters and we

168
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,119
have updated the

169
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
our tls gtls profiles parameters not to

170
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,080
include any more grease values

171
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,000
and this also allows to have uh random

172
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,200
values to be incorporated in future

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,360
tls parameters uh with this change uh

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
the the way that the network security

175
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
service would start enforcing policies

176
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
is basically

177
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,560
only if the network security service is

178
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
aware of known tls parameters it would

179
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,359
enforce

180
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
policies otherwise it would just simply

181
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,880
ignore those parameters which are

182
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,880
unknown to it

183
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,880
next slide

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,399
uh i have listed few examples just to

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
demonstrate how uh

186
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,120
this extendability is introduced and how

187
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
uh misbehavior from an iot device

188
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,240
because of a malware or an authorized

189
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,800
software would be detected

190
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,079
uh for example if a details parameter is

191
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,199
not specified in the

192
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,959
uh mud tls profile but it is recognized

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
by firewall then in that case it would

194
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,319
recognize that as

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,760
an unrecognized software or on

196
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
authorized software and can take

197
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,439
remediation action

198
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,320
uh for example in this case if if the

199
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,360
chacha 20

200
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,040
uh cipher stream is uh not specified in

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
the mud tls profile

202
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
but the parameter is already known to

203
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,239
firewall then the firewall can take

204
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
various actions either it could be

205
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,600
blocking the flow or quarantining the

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,399
iot device and remediating the device

207
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,399
next slide please

208
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
uh the other one which is which is the

209
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
major one for

210
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,200
uh to handle cases where

211
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
you have grease values or any other

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,079
unknown values

213
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
in those cases the firewall would not

214
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
take any action for example in case

215
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,680
where the

216
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,439
charger 20 history cipher stream is not

217
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,120
specified in the tls profile

218
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
and it is unknown then the firewall

219
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,440
would ignore it so this is very similar

220
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,440
to

221
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,200
grease values being ignored by a

222
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
firewall as those values will never be

223
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,279
specified in the

224
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,279
mart tls profile next slide please

225
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,959
uh this is this is a this is the problem

226
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,800
probably uh with the race conditions

227
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,800
that uh whether the iot device gets

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
updated with the new tls extensions or

229
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,479
tls versions versus

230
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,920
the firewall getting updated before that

231
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,399
so for example if

232
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,160
the iot devices get updated to support

233
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,600
new extensions or new ciphers and the

234
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
firewall is not ready

235
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,760
uh then what would happen is the mud tls

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
profile would get updated

237
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
uh the new cipher stream for example the

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,800
charger 20 would be specified in the

239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,519
multils profile but the firewall would

240
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
see that

241
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
this parameter is unknown to it and

242
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,160
immediately an alert would be triggered

243
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,560
to the

244
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,399
id administrator or the iot device owner

245
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,119
and as well as the firewall vendor who

246
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,120
is giving the network security service

247
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,160
the same applies to any other tls

248
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,480
extension or even

249
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
new tls versions for example if there is

250
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,560
a new tls version for example

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
is 1.3 and it's specified in the mud

252
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,199
tailless profile but the firewall is not

253
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,279
aware of it then

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
it would be triggered so this basically

255
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,720
ensures that

256
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,399
both the administrator of the iot device

257
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,519
and the network security provider

258
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,680
are aware of the firewall not

259
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
recognizing new parameters and if

260
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
the firewall is not readily updatable

261
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,240
its protection efficacy is going to

262
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,939
decrease with

263
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,839
time uh next slide please

264
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,079
[Music]

265
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,920
uh we have also updated the young module

266
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,680
to address several comments that we

267
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,240
received from med and others

268
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
uh especially to uh make sure that we

269
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
have an inr dtls

270
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,359
young profile to include the dtls

271
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
versions and dtls parameters

272
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,000
and those values are being used in the

273
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,519
acl which in turn is used in the

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,519
mud tls profile

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
next slide please

276
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,880
uh we also updated the mud uh mud uh

277
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,880
young module to say that whether the

278
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,959
device is indeed supporting that uh

279
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
tls gtls profile or not so a boolean

280
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,399
value is introduced so that uh

281
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,240
it would signal to the network uh

282
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,320
security device whether uh

283
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
the manufacturer is already supporting

284
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
this extension or not and that would

285
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,600
enable

286
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
uh the network security service to know

287
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,160
realize that it's not supporting and it

288
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
has to upgrade its

289
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,600
software to parse and understand these

290
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,800
new

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,800
tls profiles next slide please

292
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,839
uh the all the parameters that we have

293
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,800
in the inr tls profile

294
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,160
are are indeed picked from tls and dtl

295
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,120
assigner registries

296
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,839
uh excluding uh tls version dtls version

297
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,160
spk pin set and certificate authority

298
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,880
uh spk insight is basically pinning a

299
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,880
specific

300
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
public key or a certificate like

301
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
self-send certificate

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,240
and certificate authorities are specific

303
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,399
to each iot device we have seen

304
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,920
iot device based on manufacture make and

305
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
model

306
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,079
use certificate specific certificate

307
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,959
authorities which vary from device type

308
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,000
to

309
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,279
device type and those values have to be

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,480
defined has to be maintained and defined

311
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
by the manufacturer itself

312
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,439
inr dtls profi uh tls and dtls profits

313
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,560
does not maintain

314
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,079
any registries for dtls versions uh

315
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,599
because uh uh the way uh

316
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
the versions are maintained today is

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
because of extensibility

318
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,880
uh in tls 1.3 a new extension has been

319
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,000
introduced in which the version is

320
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,240
defined so that's the reason they are

321
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,720
not maintaining any registry for that so

322
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,079
those are the parameters which are uh

323
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,560
not present in the

324
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,000
tls and dtl as inr registries and those

325
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
are the ones that are being defined in

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,720
this

327
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,279
specification and whenever uh it's

328
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
pretty

329
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,040
easy to update the young modules because

330
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
we have new registries

331
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,439
uh whenever the dtls versions or details

332
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,079
parameter registry is added with

333
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
a new version or a parameter then the

334
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,760
young module would be

335
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,760
automatically updated by ayana

336
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,440
next slide please

337
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,399
that's it and uh any any further

338
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,040
comments and suggestions are welcome on

339
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,440
the draft

340
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,439
thank you

341
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:54,880
any comments questions

342
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:58,320
i don't see anyone coming in the queue

343
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,360
uh rob wilton is in the queue

344
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,440
uh rob so it's just a quick question

345
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,600
really i'm i'm not i missed the

346
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,959
very very beginning of this slide deck i

347
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
tried to check whether

348
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,439
the section folks had a chance to have

349
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
an early review of this just to check

350
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,000
the tls side of that or maybe they're

351
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,599
already hooked in

352
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
so that was only a question this this

353
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
draft was posted before adaption to both

354
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
tls

355
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,519
and ob security working group so we had

356
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
received

357
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,480
several of these updates were done to

358
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
address the comments that we had

359
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:37,839
received from the dns working group

360
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:37,839
brilliant thanks everyone's instead yeah

361
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:51,120
if there's no more comments so we will

362
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:54,319
go to the next

363
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
this one a second

364
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,039
matt

365
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,039
[Music]

366
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,678
matt yeah thank you uh

367
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,679
everyone yeah um yeah so this

368
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,120
this will be a i would say and a quick

369
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,760
update of the uh what we have done on

370
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,479
the

371
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,839
vpn common draft so you can just move to

372
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
the next line

373
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,119
this this yeah since the the drought was

374
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
adopted

375
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,678
last september we um we went to uh into

376
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,400
three vision of the draft and

377
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200
the um the draft was already i would say

378
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
worked out

379
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,440
in the background with the um the team

380
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,399
working on the uh the various space vpn

381
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,400
paper there

382
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,559
so that's why we we have already i would

383
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,480
say a fair stable version when we

384
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,480
we presented the document to the working

385
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,679
group so the um

386
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
the first version um that we uh that we

387
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,120
released

388
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
um addresses mainly the comment that we

389
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,439
received during the

390
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,200
the working of last call said there are

391
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,360
some i would say

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,559
minor editorial ones from from the rule

393
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,439
to

394
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,360
better articulate how the um the camera

395
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
vpn model will i would say

396
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,719
um can be reused by future revisions of

397
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
the

398
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,320
the um the current l3 uh service model

399
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,960
and and il2 uh we think that we have now

400
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
i would say

401
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,200
better text so that people will

402
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,360
understand that this vpn camera model

403
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,080
can can be reused when there is any

404
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,639
future revision of this of this document

405
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,879
um

406
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,039
there's also one um i would say

407
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,799
important good comment from from italy

408
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,360
about the uh discovering of the um

409
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,720
of the weapon camera model and as you

410
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,479
remember during the last

411
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,200
meeting we have presented this scope to

412
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,440
be uh restricted only to um

413
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,320
to types and warping that that will be

414
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
reused by

415
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,399
all the four models and um but it i

416
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,799
don't think that's we

417
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,640
need to relax that a little bit so if at

418
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200
least there are two models that are that

419
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
are

420
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
reusing some of the type we need to uh

421
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,559
to define them into the

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,400
the common model in the beginning i

423
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,840
personally don't want to uh to get that

424
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
path because otherwise we

425
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,840
there is a risk that that we will we

426
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,039
would like to be i would say

427
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,439
more exhaustive there and that

428
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,480
can i would say delay the publication of

429
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,919
the l3

430
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,880
l training um but after all after

431
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,080
discussion with the

432
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,400
with the theme and also with the

433
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,600
implementers i think that's as

434
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,480
as as we are just defining some kind of

435
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,399
library

436
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,919
it's just fine to uh to relax this

437
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,520
conference that you can put there what

438
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
we think that are really

439
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,080
um available and reusable from the uh

440
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,799
the current model so

441
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,799
we updated the uh the document to

442
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,879
include them i would say

443
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
specific items that are that are not

444
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,520
reused for example in the uh

445
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,140
l3 nm um draft but are

446
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
will be reused in the uh

447
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,600
[Music]

448
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
uh there was also a comment from italy

449
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,039
about the um

450
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,160
the the overall scope of the draft he

451
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
proposed that we um

452
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,760
not respect the the kind of types and

453
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
the group technology

454
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,480
to the vpn but to define it as a service

455
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,679
generic model

456
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,520
and that one we i think yeah

457
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,799
for me that's we are going too far there

458
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,440
so

459
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,158
we discarded that that command and we

460
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,000
think that yeah

461
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
so that there are models are currently

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,240
worked in the uh c camp working in

463
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,158
france

464
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
that can reuse this this model but it's

465
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,280
it's up to them to to decide to justify

466
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,440
why do you want to reuse it but we

467
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,760
cannot claim on our side that we will

468
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,600
cover every service so

469
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,879
we want something that will be really

470
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,439
aligned and focused

471
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,559
and respected to what your working group

472
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
is doing that is that

473
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:44,080
vpn uh vietnamese services

474
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,760
we included a note in the in the drive

475
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,918
to uh to make that sure

476
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,919
and the the last the last modification

477
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,000
we have made is about yeah and it's more

478
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,360
i would say to include more description

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,600
more um i would say

480
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,039
missing references closer than as tom

481
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,120
patch has proposed in the

482
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,280
working of last call so i think that we

483
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,600
um we have we have done i would say most

484
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,280
exercise there there are always uh

485
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,678
thanks to be to be completed but i think

486
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,678
that we

487
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,720
we have made some fair progress on that

488
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,039
part

489
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
uh and as you can see in the next slide

490
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,039
um

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
we also released the

492
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,200
second version there um actually when we

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,320
started to um

494
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,760
to seriously work on the uh nm uh we

495
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,600
have found that there are some i would

496
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,480
say some group in there that

497
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,360
that can be um move to the common one

498
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,640
and

499
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,520
and then that are also um can be reused

500
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
also in the uh

501
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,360
in iltran m so we simplified also again

502
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,400
the uh

503
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,399
deltoid m and moved the many of the

504
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
the groupings and types into the the

505
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,559
common model and we uh we have uh

506
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,159
updated the um all the three model that

507
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,520
is the l2nm

508
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,640
l train and and the vpn camera model

509
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
um so so right now we um

510
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,000
i would say the uh the current pin

511
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,678
depending on which action from on our

512
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,840
side as you can see in the next slide is

513
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,480
that um as far as we

514
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,559
will progress on the l2 nm and given

515
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,840
that we uh we think that you are already

516
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:13,120
have a stable version on the l3m

517
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,600
we will keep monitoring the how tanks

518
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,479
are

519
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
are moving uh so that we can um update

520
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
if a

521
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,760
um if required uh the the camera model

522
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
to uh to

523
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,960
make remove some of the component that

524
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,760
we will found in the

525
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,080
indeed two m into uh to the common one

526
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,000
uh

527
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,480
next slide please so this is what what i

528
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
i

529
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,200
um i was mentioning this second bullet

530
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,520
here about the synchronization between

531
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
the

532
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,720
the other streams we have

533
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,080
joe has already sent a request to the um

534
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
to the young doctors to have an earlier

535
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
review of the document that we think

536
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
that's

537
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
we we start to have something which is

538
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,240
um i would say

539
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,919
in in good shape um modulo this um i

540
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,840
would say this happened in

541
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,960
action uh on the uh m uh so we hope to

542
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,039
have i would say um

543
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,360
feedback from them and we will address

544
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,919
that as soon as we receive them

545
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,918
so the plan here is to um to it to uh to

546
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,240
have a working platform for the full set

547
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,200
of the

548
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
vpn documents meaning the l2 nm iltranim

549
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,120
and the

550
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,120
vpn camera model and as usual

551
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,559
we need the fresh eyes on the document

552
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
as we it's

553
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,678
more than year rounds that we are

554
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,320
working on these documents and it's

555
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,240
uh it's always good to have outsider to

556
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,559
to look into the document and to

557
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,440
to give us their reviews and comments so

558
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,480
that we can react on them as soon as

559
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,600
possible and this has been a

560
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,520
presentation

561
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,039
so if there are any question or comment

562
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,480
please uh not to date

563
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,039
uh yeah a a clarifying question med um

564
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,159
back a few slides can run if you if you

565
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,000
could

566
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:58,000
um one could keep going back

567
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,120
uh that one um when you said working

568
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
group last call

569
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
you you meant comments raised during the

570
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,000
adoption call

571
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,480
ah yeah yeah that's that's that's only

572
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,679
uh yeah it's the adoption called yeah

573
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:12,240
yeah okay cool i wanted to make sure

574
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,440
um so you you commented on the thing

575
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
yeah uh

576
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,640
these will be um they'll go through last

577
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,600
call

578
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,320
altogether and and we just put in a

579
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,120
working uh

580
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,678
yang doctor early review um i've read

581
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,719
the

582
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:30,159
the latest common model um

583
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,279
document um no major thoughts

584
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,679
on my part as a contributor

585
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,200
but one thing i noticed is there there

586
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,080
are a few comments in there

587
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,480
early on like this might be applicable

588
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,600
to

589
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,279
l2 xm's or something along that

590
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,760
and i thought i like that i like that

591
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,720
you were at least at least initially

592
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,600
starting to group things um or or have

593
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,400
com

594
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
elements that that one might use in this

595
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
type of

596
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,039
model either at a certain layer or a

597
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,360
certain type of yang module

598
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,640
but it seemed to get lost towards the

599
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,039
end meaning

600
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,200
at least the way i read it i things seem

601
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,879
to be mixed between

602
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,080
sms and l3 and l2 and i

603
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,720
i guess my suggestion is more of a knit

604
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,120
really is

605
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
is i like that organization to be able

606
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,840
to where possible

607
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,240
keep things um side by side where they

608
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,320
make sense so that if i'm looking for

609
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,080
things that are i don't know what the

610
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,720
best kind of

611
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,678
organization is but if i'm looking for

612
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,360
things that are more

613
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,159
maybe l2 versus l3 and then within that

614
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,439
you have nm versus sm

615
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
i i just thought that would have been

616
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,760
easier to read through some of the yang

617
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,919
module semantics and kind of understand

618
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,559
uh where i might find things that i

619
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,400
could i could extract

620
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,840
that makes sense yeah that's that's a

621
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,760
fair comment that you will think

622
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:59,840
and yeah how to make this a bit area

623
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:10,158
thanks other questions or comments from

624
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:12,480
the working group

625
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,679
i don't see anyone coming up to the q

626
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,000
med so i think you're good thank you

627
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,000
thanks

628
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:29,760
okay next one oscar will present

629
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,799
hi good morning guys so now that med has

630
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,360
presented you the common module

631
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,840
now we are going to go through the two

632
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,918
modules the

633
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,959
l3 and the l2 modules that

634
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,640
use this one so here also you have the g

635
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,559
tripos where we keep

636
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,919
all the issues so in the l3 and then

637
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,360
preco we keep

638
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,919
all the issues for three names in the

639
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,479
20m1 the similar form too

640
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,279
uh however we decided to keep all the

641
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,640
junk

642
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:01,360
together in the l3 nm prepo

643
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
for better checking so we do continuous

644
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,639
checks

645
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,320
on the on the junks all the of the three

646
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
modules together okay so if you want to

647
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,678
go for the latest uh

648
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,120
code it is the l3 name repo that holds

649
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,000
all of them the common uh l2 r3 okay so

650
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,000
next is like this

651
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,039
okay so first i'm going to tell you

652
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,000
a couple of slides about what are the

653
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,440
latest in the

654
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,480
changes since the last idf

655
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
so we were waiting to

656
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
have the common module to address all

657
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,679
the young

658
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
all the young doctors of your comments

659
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,880
so now finally

660
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,559
in the latest published version we have

661
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,480
addressed all the all the comments

662
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,520
so there were some minor editorial

663
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,799
issues like the nba compliance days

664
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,639
some just minor editorial

665
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,320
we also had some clarifications of the

666
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,640
use of appendix a so we

667
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,918
we included this list of available

668
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,039
implementations

669
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:05,360
so we just follow the guidelines for rfc

670
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,840
6982 about the implementation status

671
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,039
section so we put all the clarifications

672
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,039
also we did a lot of cleanup

673
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,360
of the of the groupings so you know that

674
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,440
the first version of m3nm had a lot of

675
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,879
a lot of groupings so now all the

676
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,279
groupings are in the common

677
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,480
module so here we are reusing all of

678
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,880
them so

679
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,559
in the latest version available in

680
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,640
indeed i think we have

681
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,000
only one grouping left in l3 n1 is a

682
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,200
just a pure l3 specific

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,480
grouping that is not nm grouping that is

684
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,510
not reusable for

685
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,679
for other parts okay

686
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,158
[Music]

687
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120
so this new young module uses all the

688
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,919
all the vpn

689
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,080
common that has been explained so also

690
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,000
we added some

691
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
text in the draft explaining the

692
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,039
rationale and which are the relation

693
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,158
with this coming

694
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,879
home module also we added some

695
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,679
section on the sample uses of the other

696
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
3m

697
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,440
model so to explain so for example how

698
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,000
to use it to

699
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,679
for enterprise layer 3dps services for

700
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,799
multi-domain cases

701
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,320
and we plan to add some

702
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,559
some more here just the explanation okay

703
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,639
also we added some completed

704
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,240
explanations of the

705
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,480
of the different sections of the draft

706
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,039
so for example we explain

707
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
the the role of the vpn profiles and

708
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,799
some

709
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:35,200
some examples uh there was also some

710
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:37,840
change to add the vpn type to

711
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
include the kind of a service signaling

712
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,760
type here

713
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,120
also we added some text to explaining

714
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,120
that from next slide please

715
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,960
er also we added some text to to explain

716
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,399
uh the underlay the underly transport

717
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,760
you know that the underlying transport

718
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,840
here is

719
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,320
in in the vpn uh what are you using to

720
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,760
er between the pes so for example if you

721
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,080
are using traffic engineering if you are

722
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,360
using ldp

723
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,840
segment route etc okay

724
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,479
then these complements too there is some

725
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,360
work

726
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,520
done in the tias working group where

727
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,399
they are doing the extensions

728
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
okay so if you choose to have a t as

729
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,959
under the transport all the extensions

730
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,399
that tell you which is the mapping is

731
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,600
that

732
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,879
of the mapping of the tunnels

733
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,439
to the to the service itself

734
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,559
that is done in tia's working group

735
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,679
extending

736
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,879
the a l3 nm

737
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,480
okay also we had an issue pending i

738
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,440
think it was like the

739
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,360
last two three itfs we had a lot of

740
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,799
discussions on the

741
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,918
are the assignment route assignment and

742
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,080
we had a

743
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,960
lot a lot a lot of discussions

744
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,960
in the in the list and implementation

745
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,679
feedback so we finally got

746
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,200
hey joe i'm not like seeing anything

747
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,799
under the show

748
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,640
show your hands too so just count me as

749
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,960
a plus one

750
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,960
sorry

751
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,840
all right there was a comment

752
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:28,000
now we show them the the earlier

753
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
assignment we have a choice now

754
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
with the four options with a directly

755
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,880
assigned with a pull a full out assign

756
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
and no rb so this is the the selected

757
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,000
choice so

758
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,000
please go on next slide

759
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,439
so we have just in this version we

760
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,000
solved the

761
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,200
all the open issues a indeed house so we

762
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,600
have just a few open

763
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,039
a few open issues since the last one so

764
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,320
you see that

765
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,279
uh i have number here that is in indeed

766
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,760
half so

767
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,640
so you see we are in the 180 something

768
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,120
just open because all the previous ones

769
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,440
were

770
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,799
were close so there are just some minor

771
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,240
territorial things

772
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,158
to to finalize so

773
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,440
to double check all the all the trees in

774
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,840
the document

775
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,960
and review the readability of the draft

776
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,760
of the

777
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,200
different sections review all the bgp

778
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,799
descriptions

779
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,240
we have some suggestions also for

780
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,679
example for the

781
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,120
for the if we want to incorporate to the

782
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,600
to the young model uh service visibility

783
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,678
flag

784
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,199
okay so instead of we are just using we

785
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,799
are using the model to request a till

786
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,320
the creation of a new series

787
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,000
so we wanted to double check if we can

788
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,720
use it for also for

789
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:50,159
service visibility not only creation

790
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,960
we need to do some cleanup on the

791
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,519
service type and the signaling option

792
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,000
type

793
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,360
so to avoid this over some overlapping i

794
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,799
think that the term might still have

795
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,080
some overlapping so we need to check

796
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,559
double check on that

797
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,760
we need to review the pc security

798
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,678
section

799
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,519
there are some manual things to add on

800
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,120
the on the static routes

801
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,240
also we have from the original

802
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,158
l3sm and we have the access to the

803
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
content service

804
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,519
to the cloud service provider so we need

805
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,480
to double check whether this still

806
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,080
applies also to the

807
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,320
network model and we also need to

808
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,960
use the commentation of ipv4 addresses

809
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,960
in the and ipv6 in the in the examples

810
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,159
okay so with just minor comments here so

811
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,279
let's go to the next

812
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,159
last slide so

813
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,320
so with this we think that all the

814
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,919
issues that we have uh

815
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,399
within the qualification of the last

816
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,600
draft were were solved so just minor

817
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,120
issues has

818
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,080
left us as explained er

819
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,678
we are using all the the common the

820
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,559
common module

821
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,440
so we think this is in this version is

822
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,918
stable it's

823
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,559
not gonna suffer major changes so it's

824
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,510
almost

825
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,840
ready for the working group class call

826
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:06,960
[Music]

827
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,239
so as in the other

828
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,000
as also said in the common module

829
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,399
the more is into the document the better

830
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,918
so please check because i think this is

831
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,679
the document that is

832
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:25,520
more stable so there are questions for

833
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,480
for this draft if not we can

834
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,480
jump to the next one

835
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,118
okay so for the l2nm uh

836
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,040
as in the previous case we updated the

837
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,159
the young module to use

838
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,359
the vpn command module groupings also

839
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,399
in the text we have started to do some

840
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:51,119
editorial work

841
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,480
to explain the common relation with the

842
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,520
draft and

843
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,520
add the different explanations of the of

844
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,640
the groupings that are

845
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,599
that are used and some

846
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,078
editorial improvements so we explain the

847
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,040
vpn profiles the signal and options the

848
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,480
vpn networks

849
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,320
connections etc i think there is still

850
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,640
some some work to

851
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,599
to do in the tutorial but we started

852
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,400
moving that

853
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,079
so we also have a big change as the the

854
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,240
full tree was too long

855
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,440
we cutted it and dissected into soup

856
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,479
trees

857
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,760
in different sections so then

858
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,119
i think it's much readable so

859
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,720
next slide please so

860
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,000
here uh as we mentioned that the l3 name

861
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,240
was very stable

862
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,760
and this l2 name is much stable but

863
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,598
there is only one

864
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,040
there is one major thing but we need to

865
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,880
finalize to to consider the

866
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:55,040
the draft let's say stable iran is the

867
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,280
complete avpr support okay so

868
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,320
i think among all the different layer

869
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,920
two types

870
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,320
all of the others were pretty much

871
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,760
covered but the vpn still had a

872
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,599
had some some gaps so in order to

873
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,280
support the vpn creation

874
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,880
for the service type we need to cover

875
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,000
the different

876
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,599
flavors of pva vpn vs land uspn the

877
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,520
classical vpn we need to add the

878
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,119
internet segment identifier

879
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,359
and there are some specific service

880
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,280
parameters like the english regulation

881
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:29,359
they are biproxy suppression anti-proxy

882
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,000
etc so there are particular vpn

883
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,720
parts and also we need to cover the

884
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
particular pvp

885
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,919
service parameter so for the pvp case

886
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,560
also we need

887
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,240
the pvb vpn flavor also we need to cover

888
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,240
the rtrds

889
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,479
that we are releasing all that from the

890
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,959
vpn code module we need to address value

891
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,480
also we will use that for the vpn common

892
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,160
we need to add the bridge domain

893
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,680
the mod type and also we need to add all

894
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,720
the i

895
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,960
am backbone identifier components

896
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,040
uh to include them here next slide

897
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,079
please

898
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,240
so also related to the

899
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,440
to the vpn uh people studying

900
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,560
is contributing with a lot of issues

901
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,280
so here i just put a sample even

902
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,560
after creating these slides there were

903
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,599
more comments reason

904
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,880
or more issues reason in the jit

905
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:32,000
regarding evpn so

906
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,000
you see that still we have uh

907
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,480
quite quite a few work on the vpn okay

908
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,599
and then we also have some

909
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,839
common l2 things so for example they

910
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,320
haven't shown how the present type is

911
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,960
different from the access priority

912
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,000
when we were requested also to add

913
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,720
examples

914
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,920
uh of the l two and m okay so similar

915
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,279
that we did in the l three

916
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,760
and here to add some some examples

917
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,760
and there is also an issue

918
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,520
there is a limit on the elements from

919
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,399
point to point on a

920
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,160
services okay so we need to solve this

921
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,160
issue so go to the slide please

922
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,919
so well the next steps in this draft is

923
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,880
so mainly is complete abp and support

924
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,839
solve all the open issues that we have

925
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
in github

926
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:31,359
and of course here please send us

927
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:34,560
senders reviews for this document

928
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,920
and because we think from all the three

929
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,078
tasks this is the

930
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,200
the one that still has some some more

931
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,160
work and some more work to do

932
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,439
and so we hope that the next version we

933
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,598
can solve all these

934
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,280
all these issues and then we complete

935
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:52,080
the pack for the next call

936
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,170
or the last call so

937
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,170
[Music]

938
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,839
questions

939
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,920
we have rob uh in the queue

940
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,160
uh just as a participant um so just a

941
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,880
quick question

942
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,279
i i think you're splitting up of the um

943
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,880
tree output in the documents is useful i

944
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,480
did wonder whether or not

945
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,320
it might also be useful to include the

946
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,359
full tree out put in the appendix

947
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,160
um so i i'm not sure i feel that

948
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,839
strongly about

949
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,359
it but it's just something to consider

950
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,200
maybe it might make it too long

951
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,160
it may be a bit repetitive but it's

952
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,359
certainly something that's worth

953
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,040
considering is

954
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,319
is whether that would be useful to

955
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,079
readers of this document or whether it

956
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,000
just adds an extra

957
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,839
10 or 15 pages that isn't useful i don't

958
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,839
know but maybe it's worth considering

959
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,520
okay the the thing with the with the

960
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,320
full tree also it was it was

961
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,400
so long not only in lines but also

962
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,400
the length it went very deep inside so

963
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,320
this is also why we decided to

964
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,960
to cut in in some trees so

965
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,960
yeah but then

966
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,640
well that sounds reasonable then that

967
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,520
sounds like reasonable answer if it ends

968
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,920
up being

969
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,680
so far uh indented due to the depth of

970
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,359
it then and it's not useful

971
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,799
uh then that makes sense and it's always

972
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,960
possible that people could generate this

973
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:25,839
from tooling fairly easy anyway

974
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,839
so that's not too much of a concern okay

975
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,480
i would say to uh to to the comments

976
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,520
from moscow that this this will be i

977
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,680
would say it will

978
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,119
it will be split over tens of pages and

979
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,879
it's really hardly readable and

980
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,520
personable by bed readers there's also i

981
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,079
would say

982
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,079
one more uh logistic issue there is that

983
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,040
the the current tools when generating i

984
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,160
would say the um

985
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,960
the the young tree tables um

986
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,240
we will end with the i would say we want

987
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,560
to represent the

988
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,680
the limit on the on the on the length on

989
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,040
the i would say

990
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,118
on the uh on the lines and the um

991
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,400
currently what we have done in the um

992
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,880
even with the

993
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,240
the the extract and the subtree that we

994
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,560
are pushing into the um

995
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,560
the core document we are modifying

996
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,720
manually the trees that you can

997
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,599
you can you can you can pass the net

998
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,359
check so

999
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,960
it would be a really a nightmare for us

1000
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,680
if we include that one because we won't

1001
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,160
have that

1002
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,319
possibility to modify manually the trees

1003
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,399
and so on so

1004
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:30,400
i would personally avoid having that the

1005
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,720
default tree there we can put it on the

1006
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,800
github and we already have a copy of

1007
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,759
that in the github and we can add a

1008
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,680
pointer

1009
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
if the work working group won't decide

1010
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,279
that but i i wouldn't

1011
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,359
put again the default tree because it's

1012
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,520
really a nightmare

1013
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,880
and um another question i have for the

1014
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,240
uh for the for for

1015
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,319
for the working group and also the chair

1016
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,000
is that as you have seen the uh

1017
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,240
in the presentation from from horse cars

1018
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,560
that we we have i would say

1019
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,000
a lot of issues currently in the in in

1020
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,960
to a m so

1021
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,560
and there is a risk that we it depends

1022
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,319
on the activity and the energy that we

1023
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,599
will put on this one but

1024
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:11,040
um if we delay this um

1025
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,200
the the vpn work and also the d3

1026
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,359
iltranm document until we have i would

1027
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,480
say a frozen version on the

1028
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,720
into a name we will do our best to

1029
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,599
to to to have that but there is a risk

1030
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,118
that um

1031
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,280
that the work may last longer so um

1032
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,240
would be fair if we i would say at the

1033
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,560
um if

1034
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
we fix a medicine or did not to say that

1035
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,359
yet if by

1036
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,799
the middle of next year we don't have a

1037
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,000
stable version

1038
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,880
or we still see comments on the

1039
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,920
ill-2 nm it would be i would say

1040
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,480
feasible that we

1041
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,520
we just run the working of last call on

1042
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,000
the uh

1043
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,599
3m and the the common model or we we

1044
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,760
have to hope to get started on the

1045
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,119
a2nm so this this this is a risk that

1046
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,119
i'm seeing on on the set

1047
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,240
um rob were you still in queued um

1048
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,599
before i

1049
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,640
was gonna yeah but if you have something

1050
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,520
i'll just quickly reply to um let's

1051
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,400
first comment

1052
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
uh yes i think it's not to include the

1053
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,440
tree out but

1054
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,560
one other possibility would be just to

1055
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,520
have um

1056
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,520
maybe appendix instructions of how to

1057
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,720
generate that or a point to how it could

1058
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,480
be generated

1059
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,839
but that might be one alternative way of

1060
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,359
not completing the saying

1061
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:26,720
using this tooling you could generate

1062
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,319
the output right i don't think that's

1063
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,240
useful or not

1064
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,520
but i agree not including this it's just

1065
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,479
going to be

1066
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,480
useless information

1067
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,040
so i on your second comment med i was

1068
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,599
going to

1069
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:49,839
try this fancy um uh show of hands tool

1070
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,839
and i'm uh um

1071
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,920
showing uh asking a question how many

1072
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,720
people have read the current versions of

1073
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,000
these

1074
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,959
l 2 l 3 nm

1075
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,599
drafts as well as the common module

1076
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,359
raise your hand please

1077
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,520
i'd like to get an idea of how

1078
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,078
how many working group eyes have been on

1079
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,839
this um just so we can get an idea

1080
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,680
towards your question of if if there

1081
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,279
if there's been a number of people

1082
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,879
who've read this

1083
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,359
um and and from an implementers and a

1084
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,480
an operator's standpoint um that feel

1085
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,040
the l three and m

1086
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,839
is is ready and the common module

1087
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,440
importantly

1088
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:36,319
is um uh common enough

1089
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,000
so to speak then maybe to your point if

1090
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,800
if there really is

1091
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,040
a struggle in in l2 and m that that

1092
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,040
there might be a need to

1093
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,880
to call a working group last call

1094
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,800
ideally as i told

1095
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,079
a number of you and the authors

1096
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,400
i think it would be good to do it all

1097
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,640
together that said i think there's

1098
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,720
definitely interest i don't think

1099
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,078
leaving l2m off would

1100
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,799
would cause it to never progress

1101
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,079
um but i i think there's there's value

1102
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,920
in making sure everything

1103
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,240
is is is properly um sewed up on all of

1104
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,520
them

1105
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,720
that's one chair's opinion but it looks

1106
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,800
like

1107
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,560
so far uh i don't know if we're gonna

1108
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,000
get many more 10 people have raised

1109
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,440
their hand that they have read it

1110
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,960
six have not raised their hand

1111
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,319
indicating that they have not read the

1112
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,160
latest versions

1113
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,240
um i haven't read i've read the latest

1114
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,879
version of vpn common and

1115
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,839
l3 i haven't gotten through l2

1116
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,839
personally

1117
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,560
so let me ask i'll end this session

1118
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,720
should we do

1119
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,319
a working group last call of l3 nm

1120
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,598
independently if

1121
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,880
issues still exist after

1122
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,800
110 on l2 nm and by 110

1123
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:05,359
i mean ietf110 um

1124
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,359
next spring spring 2021

1125
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:16,160
so it seems that there is lots of hands

1126
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,640
going up quickly i mean we had 10 total

1127
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,399
hands raised on the last one

1128
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,480
we have seven hands raised no hands not

1129
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,359
rays eight hands

1130
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,359
uh raised

1131
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,319
more hands going up so i i think it's

1132
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,919
worth uh considering i i think

1133
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:35,680
chances are if we put this out on the

1134
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,000
working group um

1135
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,960
alias that that chances are that that

1136
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,960
would be the case

1137
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,000
i would uh speaking as co-chair

1138
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,000
uh um encourage the

1139
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,920
the inter the the the people in the

1140
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,560
working group working on

1141
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,079
this uh to to work through those issues

1142
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,960
let's see if we can get

1143
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,560
uh some some more reviews like a and we

1144
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,000
talked about a yang doctor's early

1145
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,279
review of the l2 and m

1146
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,960
let's see if we can get some of those

1147
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,839
issues resolved but it sounds like

1148
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,319
there's

1149
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:06,880
certainly interest in in getting the l3

1150
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,839
nm

1151
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,280
out there um assuming that we make sure

1152
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,400
that the common module

1153
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,880
is sufficiently common um so hopefully

1154
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,079
that addresses your comments their med

1155
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,079
or question i should say

1156
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,680
thank you thank you and one last um i

1157
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,200
would say um

1158
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,799
information is that um we have many

1159
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,240
implementers that are involved in this

1160
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,760
work and we have um

1161
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,680
an appendix in which we we we provide a

1162
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,520
pointer to uh to all

1163
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,960
to each of these implementations and all

1164
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,520
this information is available on the

1165
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:45,839
github so yeah so this is a

1166
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,240
joint work which is currently done with

1167
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,960
the involvement of mini paper

1168
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,640
and and i would also encourage you

1169
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,599
speaking of github

1170
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,040
come back if if there are more eyes that

1171
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,640
you need on specific

1172
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,160
um issues you you didn't ask a lot of

1173
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,839
pointed questions here in this

1174
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,319
presentation and by

1175
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,000
you i mean oscar presented but in

1176
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:10,960
general the authors

1177
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,599
if there are things that you want more

1178
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,119
broader eyes of the working group to get

1179
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,599
consensus on please don't hesitate to

1180
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,599
ask those questions and let's get uh

1181
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,040
let's get that discussion going or those

1182
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,200
discussions going

1183
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,119
on on the list so we can get through

1184
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,319
some of those issues

1185
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,640
so here for this particular draft the i

1186
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,319
think

1187
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,240
the the biggest thing that we need in

1188
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,279
there to name is

1189
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,399
more experts on only vpn

1190
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,280
okay so i think it's the what caused

1191
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,240
some

1192
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,880
or some more delay in advance it was

1193
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,558
getting

1194
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,920
getting people with knowledge from evp

1195
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,839
and now we are getting it okay so we are

1196
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:52,240
getting people that is implementing it

1197
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,078
and so on but we need if we can have

1198
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,799
more maybe some

1199
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,240
we could promote also the work maybe in

1200
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,920
base and in other

1201
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:05,200
routine working groups to uh to have the

1202
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,200
the rice into into it

1203
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:12,000
okay um that

1204
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,559
certainly is is doable we could we could

1205
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,200
uh request some eyes over there um i can

1206
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,800
reach out to the the chairs as well over

1207
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,118
there and see if there's anyone we could

1208
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,839
get to

1209
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,119
get some reviewers looking at l2 and m

1210
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,000
to help out

1211
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,520
with some of those issues um sorry

1212
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,440
didn't mean to monopolize time

1213
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,680
you asked a chair question any other

1214
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,800
comments from co-chairs or from the

1215
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,799
other working group members

1216
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,400
don't see anyone coming in the queue so

1217
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,119
i

1218
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,240

and for con

1220
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,839
leading and continuing the work with the

1221
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:54,078
working group um

1222
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,078
thanks

1223
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,839

you're loud and clear

1227
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:19,280
okay this draft was revised

1228
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,480
during adoption

1229
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,760
so take it home

1230
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,599
feed it and be nice to it and it should

1231
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,440
be good to you

1232
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:34,400
um the

1233
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,839
suspects i don't know why massimo wanted

1234
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,680
to start this

1235
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:40,078
i did most the drafting work uh warren

1236
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,960
and

1237
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,000
eric klein who's too modest to be here

1238
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,119
on

1239
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,720
from google brought in the google work

1240
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,079
which you'll see and russ did the

1241
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,118
security stuff

1242
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:56,960
next slide please ipg

1243
00:50:53,119 --> 00:51:00,000
location is to deal with country

1244
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,880
regulations and localization etc

1245
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,119
i.e you know there's a special version

1246
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,800
of game of thrones playing in washington

1247
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,720
dc now

1248
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,000
um and you're not supposed to see it

1249
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,558
anywhere else next slide please

1250
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,559
who does

1251
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:20,880
geolocation here are the organizations

1252
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,160
providing the service

1253
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,880
of if you have an ip address they will

1254
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:30,319
give you a good guess as to where it is

1255
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,280
the quality of the guesses vary

1256
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,640
considerably um there are even

1257
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,680
researchers who

1258
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:43,118
compared them so next slide please

1259
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,440
if you go to watch that next slide

1260
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,440
please

1261
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,558
if you go to watch that version of game

1262
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,440
of thrones and you can't

1263
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,559
i.e if your data for your ip address are

1264
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,559
incorrect

1265
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,480
you have to contact all of those people

1266
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,559
and they take weeks to turn things

1267
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,760
around

1268
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,160
and you see people putting out pleas on

1269
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,119
anag every week saying

1270
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,799
i'm in bialystok and i can't watch

1271
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,240
whatever

1272
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,720
next slide please the basic problem is

1273
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:23,359
that this is uncoordinated

1274
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,200
and all those different providers of

1275
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,799
information

1276
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:32,960
are kind of almost doing research

1277
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:36,960
so there's no real data

1278
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:40,640
repository there is no ground truth

1279
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,640
okay next slide please

1280
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,319
so how do they come up with their

1281
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:48,078
guesses

1282
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:51,599
heavily used dns stated who is data

1283
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,240
dns in the sense that lots of

1284
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,200
routers have location in their names etc

1285
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,479
etc

1286
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,680
tons of strange magic but

1287
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,800
to the rescue a gang of pretty much

1288
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,240
googlers who have this problem big time

1289
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,760
of course

1290
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,078
came up with rfc 8805 which is a

1291
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,920
definition

1292
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:20,400
of a csv file which can

1293
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:24,079
for prefix ranges

1294
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:29,280
have country and

1295
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:33,119
state or whatever font city

1296
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,520
and that's the granularity because finer

1297
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,240
they're worried about in some places if

1298
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,359
you get

1299
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:43,919
down to the postal code

1300
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,720
it reveals personal information too much

1301
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,800
so this is about the limit of the game

1302
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,839
but rfc 8805

1303
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:55,920
describes geofeeds files

1304
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:59,359
next the four form

1305
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:04,160
next thank you the format

1306
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:07,920
is the rfc you publish only what

1307
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,480
you want to publish it's flexible you

1308
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,119
can geolocate single ips

1309
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,640
entire prefixes instead of as prefix

1310
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,680
match of course

1311
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:19,839
and whatever you level you wanted

1312
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,000
to for instance you could publish only

1313
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,040
the country

1314
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,440
or all the way down to the city level it

1315
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,400
has been adopted by google and

1316
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,960
a whole bunch of those providers are

1317
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,760
listed

1318
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:39,440
on slide three next slide please

1319
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,280
to discuss the geofeed format you can go

1320
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,640
to the geofeeds working

1321
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,480
group there isn't one but let's not

1322
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,078
discuss it here

1323
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:54,240
next slide please but how do you

1324
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:56,240
find geofeed profiles that's the problem

1325
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,399
okay or at least that's the problem this

1326
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,439
draft tries to address

1327
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,440
next slide please

1328
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:12,960
we use the irr who

1329
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:16,720
is and these are the inec num objects

1330
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,760
that are the external visible allocation

1331
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,359
records

1332
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:25,440
of the r rir

1333
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:25,440
that says for this range

1334
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:34,720
this is the authoritative

1335
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,920
record since we cannot modify this

1336
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,959
easily and you'll

1337
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,200
see that we have a proposal for doing so

1338
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,040
it has a remarks field and in that

1339
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,839
remarks field

1340
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,319
the person the organization which

1341
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,920
controls the identity which

1342
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:55,920
is the admin and tech contacts

1343
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,960
who have that address space put this

1344
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:03,680
url of where you can find

1345
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:08,000
a file with the geofeed information

1346
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:11,200
for that address range in the idea

1347
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,200
next slide please

1348
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,559
remarks that's disgusting next slide

1349
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,559
please

1350
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:27,680
the next gen in the irr

1351
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,680
records will instead have a geo feed

1352
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,000
attribute but of course

1353
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:37,799
that's all in the rpsl working group

1354
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,359
except there isn't one so the

1355
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:43,200
rirs are talking and conspiring

1356
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,359
and maybe this will come out in the

1357
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:48,640
meantime

1358
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:52,240
you learn to eat both and

1359
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:56,078
deprecate one with the remarks field

1360
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,479
but it's later there's a cute trick

1361
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,799
about using this hui's data

1362
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:06,079
next slide please that when you query it

1363
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:09,520
for a particular address

1364
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:13,520
the who is server returns the closest

1365
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:16,319
covering range

1366
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,720
so this works much better than a hack

1367
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:19,520
like

1368
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:20,160
dns where you would have to have an

1369
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,480
exact

1370
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:28,319
record for that address

1371
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:31,760
okay so this is just god knows

1372
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:34,160
why this happens in who is

1373
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,680
but that's what the rirs do it's really

1374
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:40,960
kind of nice

1375
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:44,160
next slide please

1376
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,839
now remember an eye net number points to

1377
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,240
a geofeed file

1378
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:51,520
but multiple ionic numbers could point

1379
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,399
to the same geofeed file

1380
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,079
and when you go to fetch following a

1381
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,799
particular identity

1382
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,839
you close your eyes to all the ones not

1383
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:05,680
covered by that item

1384
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:09,359
okay so use the longest match

1385
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:12,480
and only what is covered

1386
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,480
next slide please

1387
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,720
and of course there's a nice knit six

1388
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,839
num

1389
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,160
multiple of them can point to the same

1390
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,920
file

1391
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:29,040
please feed them over https

1392
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,839
and now we get into why russ is here

1393
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,599
which is an optional authenticator may

1394
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:37,240
be appended

1395
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:40,319
because there's a problem the

1396
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:44,799
authenticity of an eye net noun

1397
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:48,400
in the who is um

1398
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:53,520
let's say that the quality of

1399
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:56,640
update controls varies across who is

1400
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:01,040
systems across our irs

1401
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:04,799
so is the geofeed data

1402
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,960
really authorized

1403
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,599
the eye net numb provides you some

1404
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,599
assurance

1405
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:17,760
so what we propose is

1406
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,559
to have a digest of the main body of the

1407
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,079
file of

1408
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:22,720
piece you've been looking at is digested

1409
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,839
and then

1410
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,640
signed by the private key of the

1411
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:30,640
relevant

1412
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,960
rpki certificate for the covering prefix

1413
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,839
this is optional

1414
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,880
by the way of course aaron being a

1415
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:38,640
unicorn

1416
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,160
doesn't use highneck numbers they use

1417
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:45,118
knit range but it's the same act

1418
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:48,399
next slide please here's an example of

1419
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,400
the strong signature

1420
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:55,440
okay it's now

1421
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:58,480
because it is signed by

1422
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:02,400
the key of

1423
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:06,079
the rpki record for that

1424
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:10,319
range that signature cannot be good

1425
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:13,359
for some other geofeed pointer

1426
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,319
into this file so when there's a

1427
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,240
signature

1428
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:22,160
it can only represent one address space

1429
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:26,000
next slide please you can

1430
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:28,240
parse bulk who is data the rirs all

1431
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,799
provide bulk data

1432
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:35,919
over ftp et cetera et cetera aaron is

1433
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:38,640
a unicorn of course you can ask and the

1434
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,680
geoproviders get it use the data

1435
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,000
and you can get the net range from bulk

1436
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:46,480
and

1437
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,760
comments from who is an ardex

1438
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,760
next slide please and of course

1439
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,920
there's an app for that it's on github

1440
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,200
there's the url

1441
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,920
you get a linux

1442
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,279
binary and or sources and all the other

1443
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,160
usual things

1444
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,079
you run the darn thing it goes to all

1445
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:14,240
the rirs it fetches

1446
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:17,760
all the hue to his data and it produces

1447
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,040
a results csv file to cover everything

1448
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,520
for you if you're doing

1449
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,520
lookups

1450
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,839
and that's the story

1451
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:30,558
and we really appreciate more reviews

1452
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,839
reviews by the way people have been very

1453
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,520
helpful

1454
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:38,319
um and we don't want to threaten wglc

1455
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,720
just to get more review but we would

1456
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:42,558
really appreciate it

1457
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,439
and of course massimo would love people

1458
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:45,440
to run his code

1459
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:50,240
and this is in use

1460
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,000
questions

1461
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,799
questions let me check the chat

1462
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:03,200
there um there are a few comments in the

1463
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:05,359
chat

1464
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,558
from george michaelson and tom hill

1465
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,960
randy

1466
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,960
it looks like in general support for

1467
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,640
this work

1468
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,640
george has said people don't understand

1469
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,720
that almost all economy assertions and

1470
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,319
who is for numbers are about the entity

1471
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,078
head office location

1472
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,680
and not the network of use unless the

1473
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,440
records are more specific than the

1474
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,520
delegation record

1475
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,280
and randy's on the money with this draft

1476
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,720
it is a huge problem

1477
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,640
so tom just plus one that so

1478
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,759
i think there's in general support on

1479
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,000
this

1480
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,000
ntt is in tokyo right

1481
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,240
i'm at the end of an ntt circuit here in

1482
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,240
california now

1483
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,680
somebody popped in the queue for a

1484
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,799
moment

1485
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,520
i was off that screen any other comments

1486
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:58,000
for randy questions

1487
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,000
answers

1488
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,839
it's been fun thank you thanks randy

1489
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:21,280
so we go to the next slide

1490
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:24,880
uh can you hear me yes

1491
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:28,079
hello uh uh my name is edna and

1492
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:30,799
i'll be presenting uh ipfx

1493
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:32,079
information element extension for

1494
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:33,200
forwarding exceptions

1495
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,359
uh this is the first time we are

1496
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,359
presenting this in the atf and

1497
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:40,640
uh i'll be presenting this zombie on

1498
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,640
behalf of my co-authors

1499
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:46,720
um next slide please

1500
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,279
so just to give you some background on

1501
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,880
what the draft is

1502
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:58,079
uh so when you think of a network uh

1503
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:01,359
traffic drops are generally generally

1504
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,640
generally normal and they often go

1505
01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:04,400
unnoticed

1506
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,799
unless unless there is a there is an end

1507
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,799
service that is impacted

1508
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:13,200
so detecting and identifying

1509
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,319
and repairing the traffic drop in in

1510
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,279
huge networks uh

1511
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:18,400
can be uh mechanical and and very very

1512
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,799
tedious

1513
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,839
uh so in order to eliminate this this

1514
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:24,720
tedious workflow

1515
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:26,640
uh in uh in identifying and repairing

1516
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,038
the networks

1517
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,078
we can focus on simply localizing the

1518
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,240
problem and

1519
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,440
building correlation to some to some

1520
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,118
entities

1521
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,960
which which are responsible for dropping

1522
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:40,000
the packets

1523
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:43,520
if you the drop packets can can undergo

1524
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:46,960
some deep inspection uh and

1525
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,720
uh the some metadata can be can be

1526
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,160
fetched from these drop packets can be

1527
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,319
sent to the host

1528
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,440
or the software queue along with the

1529
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:56,480
type of exception

1530
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,839
that that that has invoked this drop

1531
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,920
and some metadata in this case like

1532
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,960
in and out interface and some other

1533
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,640
metadata

1534
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:09,839
which i'll be covering in the in the

1535
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,839
next slides uh next slide please

1536
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:14,319
so um yeah as i just mentioned so the

1537
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,960
exception information

1538
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,920
may be exported in any format that is

1539
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,359
desired the

1540
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,000
uh some of uh some of you we can also

1541
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,640
use

1542
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,920
young or uh ipf expo so this this

1543
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,078
proposal uh

1544
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,760
specifically focuses on ipfix for

1545
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,359
exporting uh the drop packet

1546
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:37,839
uh information um so some of the

1547
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:40,160
uh information elements uh that that

1548
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:41,440
that can be used to export metadata are

1549
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,440
already exist

1550
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,119
this draft defines a new information

1551
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,880
elements along with the corresponding

1552
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,839
formats for these new new information

1553
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,640
elements

1554
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:52,880
needed for the metadata next slide

1555
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,879
please

1556
01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:02,720
uh so uh the forwarding exceptions that

1557
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,760
that we'll be focusing on are that that

1558
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,279
generally uh uh responsible for

1559
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:12,400
for the traffic for the traffic drop um

1560
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,480
so the information elements that

1561
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,760
that that we report as part of as part

1562
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,400
of this mechanism

1563
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,760
uh may change based on based on the type

1564
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,319
of forwarding exception that has

1565
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:24,079
occurred

1566
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:26,720
on on a particular network um the

1567
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,359
this subset of information may be uh

1568
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,839
really

1569
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:31,200
key in order to identify where the

1570
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:34,640
traffic drop is

1571
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,558
in in a huge network so if

1572
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,680
when the packet drop happens or when a

1573
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,440
traffic drop happens

1574
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,440
uh what is the reason for the traffic

1575
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,400
drop which flow has encountered this

1576
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,039
drop

1577
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,480
which includes the packet content which

1578
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,240
which gives us the source

1579
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,760
source for source port and destination

1580
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,240
board source ip destination ib

1581
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,079
and a few other details and some

1582
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,680
additional metadata including what what

1583
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,319
the flow direction is

1584
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,839
uh what the next app index is uh input

1585
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:02,558
and output interfaces

1586
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:04,240
and and a few other details uh if if

1587
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,960
needed

1588
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,959
next slide please

1589
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,400
so focusing uh on this on this draft we

1590
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:14,319
have

1591
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,079
we have proposed a new information

1592
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,880
element called forwarding exception

1593
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,119
called

1594
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,799
uh which is a unique identifier

1595
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,039
describing

1596
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,400
the the reason for the for the traffic

1597
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,119
drop

1598
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,520
some irregularity or some traffic drop

1599
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,359
uh

1600
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,640
so we have uh this this particular

1601
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:35,839
forwarding exception code can

1602
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:38,000
can have different uh data records uh uh

1603
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:39,279
indicating what forwarding error has

1604
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,640
caused the traffic drop

1605
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,599
so this can be we have identified a few

1606
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,720
common ones uh an implementation may

1607
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:49,920
choose to encode

1608
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,200
its own internal device internal device

1609
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:53,520
exception codes

1610
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,960
in such scenarios enterprise bit may be

1611
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:57,920
set to one

1612
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,119
or else uh if if if if an implementation

1613
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,119
may choose to use

1614
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,240
the ident common identified exception

1615
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,480
codes they may they may set the

1616
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,200
enterprise bit to zero

1617
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,200
next slide please

1618
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:12,960
uh in addition to the forwarding

1619
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:16,319
exception code we have

1620
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:19,600
we also had the need to uh export

1621
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,400
what the next stop id is a next stop id

1622
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:26,080
is something that

1623
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:29,920
that identifies the destination

1624
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,679
inside a particular device um

1625
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,520
typically represented in a forwarding

1626
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,399
path as an index so

1627
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,880
this this is very very useful in order

1628
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,960
to

1629
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,440
fetch more details on on what the what

1630
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,439
the next stop in the next hub looks like

1631
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:45,120
uh and the next stop that the packet

1632
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:47,759
would take uh

1633
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,559
so in order to do some deep inspection

1634
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,920
uh so this

1635
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,000
this next stop id would could include

1636
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,679
some information about uh the outgoing

1637
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,520
interface and the forwarding features

1638
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,560
configured on the packet path

1639
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,759
uh etc uh so there's a unique identifier

1640
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,880
uh on any on every

1641
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,319
on on every device so

1642
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,159
this this is something that will be

1643
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,600
really useful in identifying

1644
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:13,679
uh the next the next stop details on on

1645
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,400
every packet

1646
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,399
next slide please

1647
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:25,679
uh so this this this uh

1648
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:28,239
basically captures uh what uh

1649
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:30,080
a dropped uh exception packet would look

1650
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,959
like uh in ipfx

1651
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:34,238
uh it includes it includes some of the

1652
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,839
some of the fields that

1653
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:41,519
uh that are key now in order to identify

1654
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:43,439
uh the which which devices

1655
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,679
is dropping the packets and and which

1656
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:49,040
flow is actually encountering this crop

1657
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,359
so it can be represented in in any

1658
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:53,040
format any which format uh we see two

1659
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:56,239
different formats here

1660
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,920
and it any any number of fields any

1661
01:09:56,239 --> 01:10:00,000
any number of other metadata fields can

1662
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,000
be added to this template

1663
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,840
uh so this is just a representation of

1664
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,199
uh what uh how how we

1665
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,159
uh capture different uh information

1666
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,960
elements uh

1667
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:12,000
from every device uh in order to uh

1668
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,040
specifically

1669
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,560
point out uh which entity has undergone

1670
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:19,840
some traffic drop

1671
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:22,320
and what is the reason for it uh next

1672
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,320
slide please

1673
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,320
so uh yes uh since this is the first uh

1674
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,879
this is the first time we are

1675
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:31,840
presenting this uh we are we're looking

1676
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,719
for some feedback

1677
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,440
uh and uh if yeah if you have any any

1678
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:38,159
questions

1679
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:45,839
uh suggestions uh there they're

1680
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:45,839
absolutely welcome

1681
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,519
questions

1682
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,080
so i i had one as a contributor on the

1683
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,120
next top id i

1684
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:04,559
i wasn't really clear on what

1685
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:06,000
that would be um or or i imagine this

1686
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,199
would be something that's very vendor

1687
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,400
specific

1688
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:13,599
and there would be some way of decoding

1689
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:15,679
that 64-bit value um

1690
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,920
because you you don't really give a very

1691
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,000
prescriptive you said it could be

1692
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,679
egress interface it could be other

1693
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,320
forwarding characteristics but there's

1694
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,520
nothing

1695
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,799
that i saw in the draft that was

1696
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,760
like here's an example or anything

1697
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:32,719
prescriptive

1698
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,719
of of what that could be and i know in

1699
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,080
one template you have egress interface

1700
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,880
there so i imagine there's other

1701
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,640
richness

1702
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,560
that that would give you but i wasn't

1703
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,239
clear on exactly how i would

1704
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,480
if i was implementing this how i would

1705
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:47,678
populate that

1706
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,599
uh yes so uh next up uh we will add the

1707
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:54,719
we'll add an example for the next stop

1708
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:57,520
id uh in the in the next revision um

1709
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,520
okay thanks

1710
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:09,280
um we have two in the queue uh

1711
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:11,599
jin ben

1712
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,599
question

1713
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:23,519
and ben can we can't hear you if you're

1714
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,799
asking if you're speaking

1715
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:30,719
okay uh yeah i i i think this is

1716
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,920
uh hello yeah we can hear you

1717
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:37,520
hello i'm saying that this is okay yeah

1718
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:40,560
uh i i log in from hobby but i think

1719
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,760
this is a truly a useful use case yeah

1720
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,400
because we know that

1721
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,840
in the ip there's always something the

1722
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,239
forwarding errors

1723
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,320
so i think the detailed information act

1724
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:52,559
of course will to help the

1725
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,000
troubleshooting i think this is a useful

1726
01:12:52,560 --> 01:13:04,000
use case piece

1727
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:08,480
yeah okay

1728
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,480
uh and we have shivam in the queue

1729
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:14,320
i guess can you hear me we can

1730
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,840
yeah hey i'm one of the co-op for this

1731
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,159
so i think there was a question related

1732
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,320
to

1733
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:19,599
um what does the next stop uh actually

1734
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,080
mean uh right

1735
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,880
so i i just wanted to add uh so imagine

1736
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,519
uh let's say

1737
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,120
uh in a normal forwarding path uh a

1738
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,480
packet arrives you do a lookup in the

1739
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,519
forwarding table right

1740
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:33,519
typically the result of the lookup is a

1741
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,800
next stop the tech top is nothing but it

1742
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,480
represents recording path that the

1743
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,120
packet will eventually take

1744
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:40,480
and it is supposed to uh translate into

1745
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,800
packet going out of a

1746
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,000
specific interface so obviously packet

1747
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,080
is able to successfully

1748
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,520
uh go out of that interface then you

1749
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,760
will also have the ingress interface

1750
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:52,000
material time permission set

1751
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:53,679
as is displayed in the template right

1752
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,320
but let's say the drop happens somewhere

1753
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:57,280
in between

1754
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,719
right you need to know um which path the

1755
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,199
packet was taking so

1756
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:03,199
next stop id in that case can be that id

1757
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,239
with internal your system represents

1758
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:07,519
that forwarding path

1759
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:10,239
and let's say a bunch of uh

1760
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:12,000
show commands on your node or or

1761
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:14,080
metadata that you have

1762
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,280
would wear on the controller can be used

1763
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,120
to correlate saying that

1764
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,639
this next hop id actually represented

1765
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,199
this outgoing interface and therefore

1766
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,600
the packet

1767
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:23,599
uh during this process

1768
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,199
that is pretty much this command okay

1769
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,280
yeah

1770
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,480
i i think seeing an example or

1771
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,639
understand that

1772
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,559
could could certainly help because it

1773
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,080
feels kind of nebulous the way it's

1774
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:39,120
written right now

1775
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:43,840
but but thanks for that sure sure we'll

1776
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:43,840
we'll cover that

1777
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:49,840
other questions

1778
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:58,239
uh rudiger i see you in the queue as

1779
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,239
well

1780
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,120
we can't hear you okay

1781
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:14,640
yeah oh we can hear you more

1782
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:17,760
fine um i

1783
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,280
would suggest to

1784
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:25,360
uh look at

1785
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,080
the question of how to form it

1786
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:31,519
and how to define and how to define the

1787
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,519
schema for the data

1788
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,400
afresh

1789
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:42,799
i highly suggest when

1790
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:47,040
to look at cddl

1791
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:50,560
schema and seabor encoding

1792
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,199
and removing essentially

1793
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,440
the need for interpreting large ascii

1794
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,440
art

1795
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:07,759
uh sure ready could you yeah

1796
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,800
that's that's uh uh interesting comment

1797
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,320
so uh uh

1798
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,000
we will we'll look in there could could

1799
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,360
you also uh respond uh

1800
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:18,400
uh uh on the on on the mailing list uh

1801
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:21,440
we will follow up that

1802
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:24,000
i'll try thank you

1803
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,639
and uh i'd encourage to everyone to

1804
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,199
review this

1805
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,120
and any any comments or suggestions

1806
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:35,839
would be really great

1807
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:35,840
thank you folks thanks

1808
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,080
okay let's go to the next presentation

1809
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,839
i'm a new camera and i'm very happy to

1810
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:08,400
join such a big family

1811
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:11,040
okay today my topic is network

1812
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:16,239
monitoring or idp

1813
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:19,120
next slide please

1814
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,519
um first i introduced the previous work

1815
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:22,080
uh

1816
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,440
last year a draft a draft about the

1817
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,840
network wide

1818
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:32,000
protocol the monitoring at the summit

1819
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:35,120
some use needs are identified in aid

1820
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,640
the or already originally now the

1821
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:40,000
modification motivations

1822
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:41,360
are as follows first is the quickly

1823
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,920
reporting

1824
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,519
especially the adp protocols containers

1825
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,719
need to be reported

1826
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:51,760
reported quickly and the second

1827
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:54,080
is the high performance means processing

1828
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,360
maybe the binary encoding it has the

1829
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,480
more better the

1830
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,199
performance than other encoding and the

1831
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:01,440
study is

1832
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,919
we want to get a protocol that is the

1833
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:06,799
easier to standardize

1834
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,480
and analyze though by the monitoring

1835
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:11,440
scope

1836
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,320
at first we want to support the includes

1837
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:16,799
the adp

1838
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:20,559
ldp and svt and river and so on

1839
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:24,480
in fact the the the idea about

1840
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,560
the monitoring the adp and

1841
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:29,678
first of all first the president either

1842
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:33,440
the 135 with the atf meeting

1843
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,440
okay next slide please

1844
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,840
let me talk about the recent changes

1845
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,239
with the input from the customer

1846
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:47,920
discussion and the new standard process

1847
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:51,120
under the demo verification result we

1848
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:53,679
identified some idp use case

1849
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,480
and also the performance we find the is

1850
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:56,880
similar

1851
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:57,919
between the telemetry based and the bmp

1852
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,520
live

1853
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:04,400
and the last last changes the scope

1854
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,920
and we find that in fact the for rib we

1855
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:10,920
find the young module

1856
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:12,719
for the river has been defined in rfc

1857
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,320
8431

1858
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:19,679
and about the svt and ldp

1859
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:23,679
with the rapid development of the

1860
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:26,719
rooting technologies the rsvt and rdp

1861
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:30,239
is replaced so next so

1862
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,960
so the current drought we focus on the

1863
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:37,678
idp

1864
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:41,600
only okay next slide please

1865
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:45,120
uh here are at least two adp use case

1866
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:48,159
the first one is isis rupert piping

1867
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:51,199
and the locating of the

1868
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:53,360
flipping source and the identifying of

1869
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:56,480
the root causes haven't been

1870
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:57,679
easy work due to various reasons the

1871
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:01,040
cause may be

1872
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:04,719
systematic reflux or acid snapship

1873
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,199
driving or driving and so on

1874
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:08,159
and another use case is sdb and

1875
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:11,360
secondation

1876
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:13,519
failure during the isis flooding

1877
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:16,000
however sometimes the lsp the

1878
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:18,639
synchronization feeling happens

1879
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,360
the cost maybe has a lot maybe the first

1880
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,600
day the

1881
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,480
identity is not creative advice is the

1882
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,840
white history

1883
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:28,879
or transmission error or is received but

1884
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:30,320
now the current process oh this is the

1885
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,520
tool you feel for

1886
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,759
access okay on that side please

1887
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,760
okay

1888
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:44,400
okay so we're recording the

1889
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:45,519
accordion that we introduce the case

1890
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,799
under

1891
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,760
the original the motivations so we

1892
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:53,679
we stress in the two solution options

1893
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,560
the operation one

1894
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,320
is bmp-like we can also define the new

1895
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,080
bmp message types

1896
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,799
and the game from work our new protocol

1897
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:06,880
and open tool is a telemetry based we

1898
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,560
can define the young module for s

1899
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:13,840
for assist the message so

1900
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:18,080
that's all okay any

1901
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:20,320
thanks looks like robin's back at the

1902
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,320
mic

1903
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:31,920
robin

1904
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:35,519
hello yep we can hear you

1905
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:38,880
okay uh robin from javi uh i added some

1906
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,679
uh add some of the points uh

1907
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,360
besides the presentation uh in fact that

1908
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:46,639
we truly

1909
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:49,839
have this work uh two years ago

1910
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:53,360
but we later we we explained

1911
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:56,159
we found that there's a lot of a lot of

1912
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:57,839
things that happens in the routine area

1913
01:21:56,159 --> 01:22:00,719
so that

1914
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:03,600
these are the points that we truly

1915
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:08,080
identify the possible use cases

1916
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:12,400
that that's necessary to export

1917
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:16,480
the uh idp protocol data

1918
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:19,759
i mean the the uh rsa

1919
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:23,199
packet or the our

1920
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:26,560
rsp pdu package for the

1921
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:29,599
troubleshooting or other usage but

1922
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,239
from our point of view maybe is a little

1923
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,280
difficult

1924
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:36,320
to defend the young model for such a

1925
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:39,440
work so that we want uh

1926
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:44,000
to limited the scope of this work

1927
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:47,120
and try to unify the igp and the bdp

1928
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:51,360
to export the protocol related

1929
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:54,719
data with the similar mechanism

1930
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:57,599
that's the the the work so

1931
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,920
i wanted to collect the feedback from

1932
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,880
this

1933
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,760
the working group and also this is the

1934
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,440
ops

1935
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:08,639
area yeah that's uh at this point for

1936
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,638
the clarification

1937
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,360
um thanks i i i would suggest

1938
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:20,080
i haven't seen this round any discussion

1939
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,960
on the ops

1940
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,519
awg list i would suggest raising what

1941
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,440
you

1942
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,960
the points you want to get clarity on

1943
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,559
there um

1944
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,320
and and the previous uh time the related

1945
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:34,880
work was presented

1946
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,840
i think people from um i want to say

1947
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:38,960
grow

1948
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,239
as i recall um commented um so it might

1949
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,600
be good to

1950
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:46,718
get just to get their uh

1951
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,239
take on this as well um from the routing

1952
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,199
area it sounds like maybe you've already

1953
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:51,280
done some of that

1954
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,320
but bringing that into the the working

1955
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:54,719
group would be

1956
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:58,480
would be useful to trigger or catalyze

1957
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,480
some of those conversations on the list

1958
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:07,120
okay okay i this uh okay we will try to

1959
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,679
do this work and also use it to engage

1960
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:10,960
the

1961
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:14,840
grow area and also the routine area

1962
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:17,199
people okay thanks and ram you're in

1963
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,840
queue

1964
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,120
uh yes i've i've not read this draft i'm

1965
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,520
just looking at the slides here

1966
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,639
i think the the big question for me is

1967
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:27,760
still as to

1968
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:29,920
why we'd want a new protocol here um

1969
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,280
rather than like use what's already

1970
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:33,040
there and

1971
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:35,040
specifically on the first slide there's

1972
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,880
a comment saying that it'd be easier to

1973
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,679
define a new protocol

1974
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:42,080
than to try and define uh the data that

1975
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,719
needs to be exported in yang and i

1976
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,360
um i'm struggling to understand why that

1977
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,400
is

1978
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:51,360
uh and even in the case that you um

1979
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,080
may not want to expand the news out into

1980
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:54,080
the yang

1981
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:55,360
you could still carry them in the in a

1982
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,639
yang data model

1983
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:59,199
encoded um as binary pdus of binary data

1984
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,920
so

1985
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:02,799
i think for me the key thing here is to

1986
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,120
try and

1987
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,840
understand the data you're trying to

1988
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:10,000
export

1989
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:12,239
off and to understand um clearly

1990
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,360
what what doesn't work with the existing

1991
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:16,959
protocols

1992
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:19,120
have they been tried and before we

1993
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,239
go down the path of trying to invent a

1994
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,199
new protocol here because that would

1995
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:27,839
seem to be

1996
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:27,839
significantly more work naively

1997
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,280
i understand your point in fact in this

1998
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,440
draft this in order to propose this is

1999
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:44,239
the new protocol

2000
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:45,919
here is also mentioned because in this

2001
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:49,919
draft we propose that

2002
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:55,199
the reusing the pmp for this

2003
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:58,560
for this requirement user just to extend

2004
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:59,440
several the message type only used for

2005
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,560
the

2006
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:05,759
for the idp so this is the

2007
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:07,600
this is the proposal in this draft

2008
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,600
and also you mentioned that's the

2009
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,000
possible this is the young model

2010
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,639
uh yeah because we also use the learned

2011
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,280
uh

2012
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,080
discuss with some of the young model uh

2013
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,440
experts

2014
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:22,480
and also because of

2015
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:26,080
a little concern is that to export

2016
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:29,839
the uh the protocol the

2017
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:32,719
protocol the package through the model

2018
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,120
i we are not experiencing enough in this

2019
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,760
one

2020
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,639
so we would like to collect the more

2021
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,440
feedback

2022
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:40,400
yes through this the main list well

2023
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:51,839
thanks very

2024
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:51,839
much for your comments

2025
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,600
just just to add one more comment to

2026
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,000
that then i again it goes back to i

2027
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,560
think

2028
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,159
focus on on clearly what the data is

2029
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,480
that you want to export

2030
01:27:02,159 --> 01:27:05,519
and then that might help guide you with

2031
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,239
what the right answer is

2032
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,000
is there may be that actually that you

2033
01:27:08,239 --> 01:27:14,000
want to try and do it both ways i

2034
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:16,880
have bmp extensions if that's possible

2035
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,400
i don't know bmp very well and also

2036
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,639
define it in yang

2037
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,960
um one other comment was about the

2038
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,600
encoding performance of using xml json

2039
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:26,480
and a different path there is to use um

2040
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,040
either cbor

2041
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,400
as a binary encoding i know that netcomp

2042
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,960
doesn't support that today but that is

2043
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:36,239
something there's been some interest in

2044
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:38,800
or to use gpb if you use going through

2045
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,799
that stack

2046
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:47,840
okay okay okay thanks

2047
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:53,519
other questions actually i think we

2048
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:54,480
probably want to move on to give ops

2049
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,520
area some time

2050
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,919
so yes please take your questions to the

2051
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,440
list

2052
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:03,760
uh robin um

2053
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,759
thanks

2054
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:09,029
[Music]

2055
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:17,520
oh i think you're up okay thank you

2056
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:20,559
can hear me we can yes

2057
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,080
and this is paul uh i'm

2058
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,840
going to present this uh vpn performance

2059
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,880
monitor young model

2060
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:32,639
on behalf of all the other

2061
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,639
authors next please

2062
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:38,239
oh it seems not

2063
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,799
complete with the figure but actually

2064
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:46,239
this figure is

2065
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:49,360
from rp 41

2066
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:52,480
76 it's about the framework

2067
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:55,679
for layer 3 uh vpn operational

2068
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:58,799
and management and this figure is about

2069
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:00,320
the customer view of the different vpn

2070
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,679
manager function

2071
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:07,120
and you can see uh on the bottom of this

2072
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:08,000
figure there's a vpn assurance function

2073
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,679
there

2074
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:17,199
so it means that uh the the customer

2075
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:20,960
doesn't uh uh aside from the

2076
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:24,559
the older uh implementation then

2077
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:28,239
they also want some performance

2078
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:32,719
monitoring to provide it to evaluate

2079
01:29:28,239 --> 01:29:39,839
whether the product is in good

2080
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:39,840
condition then next

2081
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:47,360
and then uh i mean the previous one

2082
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,840
it seems yeah

2083
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:50,799
and different also from the the same

2084
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:54,560
dropped

2085
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,960
and the last page is from the customer

2086
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,159
view

2087
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,000
and from the network review the provider

2088
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:03,519
management system

2089
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,560
must monitor the devices those devices

2090
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,760
that

2091
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:10,800
to implement the service uh the way

2092
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:14,480
uh the the goal is to evaluate

2093
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:17,920
the program uh whether they match the

2094
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:21,360
service fls so

2095
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:25,120
i i will so that's the intention here

2096
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,120
then next slide please

2097
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:35,920
given the working group

2098
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:39,679
has already worked on the

2099
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:42,159
modeling based framework

2100
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,000
for automation of service and network

2101
01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:47,120
management

2102
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,239
we can see that the figure

2103
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:53,440
is from the automation draft

2104
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:56,559
and uh and there three

2105
01:30:53,440 --> 01:31:00,480
nm and layers three uh two nm uh

2106
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:03,840
have have been developed to fit for the

2107
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,919
service delivery automation process

2108
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,440
but the performance monitoring and

2109
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:15,199
notification is still missing there

2110
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:18,719
so this draft is trying to fill this gap

2111
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:19,360
so this is the our function of this

2112
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:23,760
draft

2113
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:23,759
so next please next slide please

2114
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:31,920
uh our um modeling uh cons

2115
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:35,040
approach is to augment

2116
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:39,040
uh rc 83 45

2117
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:42,239
because uh it has defined the

2118
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:46,080
physical network topology so

2119
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:46,959
uh our thinking is we all we can augment

2120
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,639
that dropped

2121
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:54,159
with a more uh vpn performance monitor

2122
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:57,280
data to extend it

2123
01:31:54,159 --> 01:32:00,480
on it so we can see a whole picture of

2124
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:02,559
the vpn services on the performance

2125
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:05,919
monitor part

2126
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:09,040
so you can see in this figure uh

2127
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,080
the the position of this model is the

2128
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:13,679
similar

2129
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:16,800
position as their service network models

2130
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:16,800
so next slide please

2131
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:25,440
then uh in this slide uh

2132
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:28,638
we i give some example

2133
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:30,879
on the the relationship

2134
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:32,480
with the vpn performance monitor model

2135
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:36,159
and uh

2136
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:39,440
the 83 45 the basic

2137
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:43,280
network topology model uh we

2138
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:46,799
our consideration our proposal is to

2139
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:49,920
extend the nodes and sometimes

2140
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:53,360
links or uh termination points

2141
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:57,280
with the corresponding vpn

2142
01:32:53,360 --> 01:33:00,400
data on it so in that way we can

2143
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:03,280
not only associate the vpn

2144
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,080
services via the underlay network

2145
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:08,080
topology

2146
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:11,519
but also we can see on on

2147
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:15,199
that on top of that uh what the current

2148
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,840
european statistics is like uh what kind

2149
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,638
of uh

2150
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,840
topology and uh what's the current uh

2151
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,760
european

2152
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:27,760
uh routine pair on each uh site

2153
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:30,800
uh the usage uh later on that

2154
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:34,159
and on the bottom uh i give some

2155
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:37,760
example on the how this model

2156
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:40,480
being uh created like uh after the

2157
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,000
weapon service configuration has uh

2158
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:46,080
completed then

2159
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:49,760
uh the existing om mechanism can be

2160
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:52,239
used to collect the the different uh

2161
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:55,760
data of vpn services

2162
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:58,239
so in the third step

2163
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,600
we can collect the telemetry data of

2164
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:03,199
between

2165
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:06,480
ins interfaces uh tunnel

2166
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:09,599
nodes and to calculate

2167
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:13,040
the aggregate appears with data

2168
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:15,360
then and also we can have the abstract

2169
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:19,840
topology all right

2170
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:22,559
the next

2171
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,760
so here uh i don't we'll go to the

2172
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:27,440
detail of the

2173
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:30,800
model uh the basic idea here is just to

2174
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:33,678
uh with augment node link

2175
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,320
and also termination point to extend uh

2176
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,679
more

2177
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:41,599
vpn related data on it

2178
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:44,840
and also we can use uh reuse current

2179
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:49,440
uh netconf uh

2180
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:52,960
uh young push or subscription model to

2181
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:56,159
to subscribe uh those data

2182
01:34:52,960 --> 01:35:00,639
uh from the devices so

2183
01:34:56,159 --> 01:35:03,280
uh that's that this is a model so

2184
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:03,280
next please

2185
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:16,080
this draft has been discussed

2186
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:19,679
in last ietf meeting and also

2187
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:23,280
we also give some

2188
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:26,400
uh also proposed to be discussed uh

2189
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:29,840
in one of the layer three uh

2190
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:33,920
and them uh working uh core meeting

2191
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:36,400
so we uh have some

2192
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,119
comments from there so we updated the

2193
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:40,480
draft

2194
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:44,159
to satisfy those uh comments

2195
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:47,440
so we think uh this draft

2196
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:49,839
is try to fill the missing pieces

2197
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,839
of the whole closed-loop yarn-based

2198
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:55,280
system so

2199
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:57,840
so we propose this draft to be included

2200
01:35:55,280 --> 01:36:01,440
to vaping document sets

2201
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:03,360
and also we think uh this draft is quite

2202
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,360
stable

2203
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:09,679
to for the working group adoption so

2204
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,119
that's all for this presentation thank

2205
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:14,320
you

2206
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:17,599
any we'd like to hear more comments

2207
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,599
on this chat thank you

2208
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,600
questions

2209
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,880
um don't see anyone coming up bo thanks

2210
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,159
for presenting the um

2211
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,840
on the question of last call so i i i

2212
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:35,360
went and looked because i remembered you

2213
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,639
presenting this before but i don't

2214
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:38,960
recall ever seeing

2215
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,639
discussion on the list about it and i

2216
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,760
couldn't find any i did find it

2217
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,560
mentioned in

2218
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:46,400
like you said in some of the other vpn

2219
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,960
related conversations

2220
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:51,040
um it sounds like it's great that the

2221
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:54,320
core team working on this is

2222
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:55,119
is discussed this and i i i i don't

2223
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,920
doubt that

2224
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:58,960
that iterations have happened there but

2225
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:01,760
to bring that back

2226
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,679
to the list um would be very useful to

2227
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,800
get more eyes on it more of the

2228
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,639
discussion

2229
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:09,520
so it doesn't feel like it's coming out

2230
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:12,560
of nowhere if we do a last call

2231
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:15,119
so if if you could even

2232
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,920
bring it and announce it talk about some

2233
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:17,440
of the issues

2234
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,440
that you've um

2235
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,599
[Music]

2236
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:23,519
address some of the conversation that's

2237
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:24,880
happened on those core calls that would

2238
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,320
be very useful

2239
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:30,560
to get some uh recorded uh

2240
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,080
conversation recorded uh discussion

2241
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,080
about this so then we can

2242
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:36,880
we we can get to um calling for a

2243
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,239
working group

2244
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,239
consensus on adoption

2245
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:54,320
okay sure thank you thanks

2246
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,320
is there any more questions and comments

2247
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,719
no let's go ahead

2248
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,679
so elliot how fast can you be

2249
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,000
very there's you know this is a very

2250
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,000
quick update how about five minutes

2251
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,480
okay then then we'll give it over to you

2252
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:23,679
rob and warren

2253
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:27,519
okay so this is just a very uh

2254
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:30,960
simple update on a a previous draft

2255
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:33,760
um the next slide please

2256
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,520
um this is all about software bills of

2257
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:36,320
material which i presented on the last

2258
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,000
time

2259
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:41,759
um and uh the the big

2260
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,520
the the use of software bills of

2261
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,000
material is to determine

2262
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:47,840
um amongst other things uh what sort of

2263
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,360
vulnerabilities a system has

2264
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:54,000
and what sort of exposure a network

2265
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:56,320
might have to particular vulnerabilities

2266
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,520
one of the challenges we now know how to

2267
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,080
write these things but we don't

2268
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,320
necessarily

2269
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,280
know how to retrieve them in a

2270
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,559
standardized way

2271
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:05,920
and so this draft is working on how to

2272
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,960
retrieve them

2273
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:11,040
and it solves it in several ways one is

2274
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,400
via a well-known prefix and the other is

2275
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,400
via mud extension

2276
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,759
we've explored other ways but these are

2277
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,839
the ways that we're moving with

2278
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:19,840
thus far next slide please

2279
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,159
now this is an update of a previous

2280
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,719
draft the

2281
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:29,199
this draft focuses far less on mud and

2282
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,880
far more on s-bombs and how to share

2283
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,719
the introduction has been rewritten to

2284
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,679
make that clear but largely speaking the

2285
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,560
content

2286
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,280
uh in terms of the the model for mud is

2287
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,760
the same

2288
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,480
and we have the definition of the with a

2289
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:44,080
well-known

2290
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:46,159
uh suffix uh defined um the security

2291
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:48,320
considerations have been added to

2292
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:49,280
um we there's one or two more mechanisms

2293
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,320
we want to add

2294
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:55,360
in terms of um being able to

2295
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:56,719
advertise different sorts of uh

2296
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:58,080
retrieval mechanisms there are a couple

2297
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:01,280
of other protocols that

2298
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,639
that that we would add but that's a very

2299
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,880
small change

2300
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:06,159
and um we need to add a little bit of

2301
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,639
non-normative text

2302
01:40:06,159 --> 01:40:09,199
to describe those mechanisms but that's

2303
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:13,679
really

2304
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:13,678
about it um next slide please

2305
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:19,199
so um a couple of points just to mention

2306
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,000
michael has raised one or two other

2307
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:23,199
issues

2308
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,440
uh around uh this draft they're not

2309
01:40:23,199 --> 01:40:27,280
nothing that are show stoppers we we

2310
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,519
talked about possibly adopting it

2311
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:30,880
last time and maybe it's worth starting

2312
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,880
the call for adoption

2313
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,239
if you guys are up for it or we should

2314
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,480
do that um

2315
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:38,718
 say real soon now even if we do

2316
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,799
adopt it i would expect it to take a

2317
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,480
little while to get through the process

2318
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,000
uh simply because we want to sync with a

2319
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,599
couple of the other uh protocol

2320
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,840
developers that that are doing this and

2321
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:51,360
some of them are inside and outside the

2322
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:54,560
iutf

2323
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:56,799
and that's it how was that that was

2324
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:59,280
quick

2325
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,280
questions

2326
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:08,719
hank yeah as an individual hi elliot um

2327
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:10,960
you were talking in the last slide about

2328
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:14,000
um retrieval

2329
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:17,040
and some hints maybe um i am

2330
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:18,880
aware that uh stephen bangert

2331
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,960
and dave waltermeyer from nist were

2332
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:24,159
introducing the rolly

2333
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:25,920
uh mechanism to retrieve software

2334
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:28,719
inventory related information maybe

2335
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:32,800
that's that's something to look at here

2336
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:35,520
yeah i mean so the the purpose of um

2337
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,960
this work is to point at the different

2338
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:38,719
types of mechanisms

2339
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:40,320
um there's not going to be a single one

2340
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:41,360
but i think it's probably you're right

2341
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,400
we should make sure that we're

2342
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,199
coordinating with them

2343
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:47,040
this draft by the way is co-authored by

2344
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:48,480
scott rose also from nist

2345
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,119
so i'll make sure that he's talking to

2346
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,119
his colleagues

2347
01:41:52,560 --> 01:42:02,719
sounds good thanks

2348
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,400
but that also bears on the next

2349
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:07,840
discussion one of the next discussions

2350
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:07,839
right which is coordinating all this

2351
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,000
and i i have seen the discussion on this

2352
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:17,280
i think we

2353
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,679
can we can bring

2354
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:20,400
adoption to the list we seem to have

2355
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,560
enough

2356
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:28,320
interest at least and see how how well

2357
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:29,760
it would be supported for adoption

2358
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:31,519
and there was at least a little bit of

2359
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:33,920
running code it's not perfect but there

2360
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,920
is some

2361
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:37,599
great thanks elliot

2362
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:45,519
thank you so that's uh

2363
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:48,960
that's opposite awg um i hand it over to

2364
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,239
you uh rob and warren i think we got

2365
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:54,480
your slides

2366
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:57,919
up they're now in data tracker um

2367
01:42:54,480 --> 01:43:03,360
do one much uh they want me to share the

2368
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,360
screen or yeah rob

2369
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,678
yourself kiara and if you're willing to

2370
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,280
share that would be great i think that's

2371
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:11,119
that's more likely to work than us

2372
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:12,080
trying to play i haven't done a screen

2373
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:15,440
share through

2374
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:17,519
me so i'll save the time

2375
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:20,960
i i was able to load the slides 10 run

2376
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:20,960
if you want me to try and share them

2377
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,840
or if you've got them up that's fine too

2378
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:39,840
i stopped the showing okay let's see if

2379
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:39,840
i can do this

2380
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:53,840
uh selects

2381
01:43:54,159 --> 01:44:00,480
that's gonna look weird how about this

2382
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:01,839
oh good uh

2383
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:03,759
yes you might want a little bit bigger

2384
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:09,040
if that's possible

2385
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:09,040
can you still see it uh

2386
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,719
you're sharing a lot

2387
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:22,880
okay let me try this

2388
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,880
i think we learned from uh

2389
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:29,519
select oh maybe i

2390
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,519
oh screen one

2391
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,840
now i bet you can see it

2392
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:45,199
that's good yeah okay all you thank you

2393
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:48,320
so um so so welcome to the ops

2394
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:49,199
area part of the meeting and um from

2395
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,639
warren i

2396
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:53,199
and i think the main thing we would like

2398
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:56,719
i have some discussion on the itops

2399
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,000
russian group charter that we're trying

2400
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,320
to charge at the moment

2401
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,080
i would also like to mention that warren

2402
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:06,559
and i having

2403
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:09,519

01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:16,719
remember to put a link into that at the

2409
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,840
end of this as well so

2410
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:19,440
if anyone wants to any further

2411
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,960
discussion issues with warren and i

2412
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,440
there's an opportunity after this

2413
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,800
meeting

2414
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:27,040
uh during the break so um

2415
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:31,840
so to give some background here uh go to

2416
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:31,840
the next slide please

2417
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:36,320
so um there's been discussion about

2418
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,600
having

2419
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:41,440
some some sort of ops or iot based

2420
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,600
working group and for quite a long time

2421
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:44,638
in the sg long lot longer than before i

2422
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,760
joined

2423
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:49,760
and um in the last uh

2424
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:51,760
four months or so warren and i have been

2425
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,520
trying a lot harder to try and get that

2426
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,520
that charted and set up and i think we

2427
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,960
are almost over the hill

2428
01:45:55,520 --> 01:46:02,080
now um but it's um but worth discussing

2429
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:04,080
the aim of this is to really have um a

2430
01:46:02,080 --> 01:46:07,280
focal point for discussion

2431
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:10,320
of issues related to iot uh uh

2432
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:12,639
operational issues and also trying to

2433
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:13,280
act as almost like a coordination point

2434
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,679
where

2435
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:16,639
lots of different work is happening in

2436
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:18,880
the ietf

2437
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,440
and protocols related to iot but

2438
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:23,040
sometimes it's hard to

2439
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:24,960
coordinate all of those or know what's

2440
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:28,400
going on and the idea here

2441
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,920
for iot ops is to have a working group

2442
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,599
where

2443
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,119
where that can also be coordinated in

2444
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,639
some way and discussed and things so

2445
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,559
people know what's going on

2446
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:37,760
and gives an opportunity for people

2447
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:42,159
outside of iit

2448
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:45,040
outside of ietf to be able to bring

2449
01:46:42,159 --> 01:46:47,199
new iot related work into the iatf if

2450
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:50,159
they don't quite know where it should go

2451
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:51,759
so at the moment there's a perception

2452
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:55,119
that it's sort of quite hard

2453
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:56,719
if you're external to itf um and

2454
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,239
i've got work related to iot to know

2455
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:00,400
where to bring it there's no sort of

2456
01:46:58,239 --> 01:47:02,000
focal point and the aim of this working

2457
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:04,638
group is to try and do that

2458
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,639
it's a bit different from a regular

2459
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:08,560
working group in the sense that

2460
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:10,000
it's expected to be a bit more

2461
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,440
discussion focused

2462
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,440
and and

2463
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,880
related rather than just working on

2464
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:19,440
producing documents

2465
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,159
so it has a bit more of a mops feel if

2466
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,719
anyone

2467
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:24,799
and if you're aware of mops uh but the

2468
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:28,080
expectation is it can do some work

2469
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:30,800
so it's okay for it to be um

2470
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:31,679
discussing uh informational documents or

2471
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,800
bcps

2472
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:37,920
and to be discussing potential new work

2473
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,119
but the aim is that if if new work is

2474
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,560
identified

2475
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:42,559
that although there need to be further

2476
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,199
discussion about where that work

2477
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,560
happens so it might be that that goes to

2478
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:47,678
one of the existing working groups or

2479
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:50,320
another area

2480
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:51,920
it might be that we need to spin up a

2481
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:54,400
new working group to do that work

2482
01:47:51,920 --> 01:47:56,239
or there is a possibility that it might

2483
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,159
even be possible to do that

2484
01:47:56,239 --> 01:47:59,440
um in iot ops but there would need to be

2485
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:03,199
further discussion

2486
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:05,280
with the isg the isg and to decide if

2487
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,080
that was if that was feasible for small

2488
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,280
bits of work

2489
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:11,280
so um at the moment the the aim is for

2490
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:14,000
that to be outside the charter that

2491
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,880
you can't do protocol work but if that

2492
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,239
does come up

2493
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:21,360
we can um have another look to see um

2494
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:24,559
what the best way of doing that is

2495
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:24,559
uh next slide please

2496
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:28,639
so some discussion points it's worth

2497
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,320
saying that there's actually been some

2498
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:32,159
further discussion this week on this and

2499
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,040
i think we sort of resolved

2500
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:36,400
um some of this i believe the general

2501
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,280
agreement between the discussion we've

2502
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:40,159
had is that

2503
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,920
um is that still should not do um

2504
01:48:40,159 --> 01:48:43,920
protocol work directly

2505
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:46,560
and instead it says here perform a

2506
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:49,199
dispatch function i think again the word

2507
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:50,639
dispatch isn't necessarily the best

2508
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:52,960
choice and we might

2509
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:54,560
take that out of the charter the idea is

2510
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:56,960
really that

2511
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,320
like any working group if there is

2512
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,840
discussion about particular work that

2513
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,840
needs to happen

2514
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:03,600
and it's not the right place then the

2515
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:06,000
this working it would help to redirect

2516
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,560
that work to other places or work out

2517
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:09,760
where the place best place for that work

2518
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:11,679
to occur is

2519
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,520
but it doesn't need to follow a very

2520
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:16,880
strict and dispatch

2521
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:17,920
model where the conversation is focused

2522
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,239
purely

2523
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:22,000
only on how you dispatch the documents

2524
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:23,519
and not on the content at all

2525
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,119
we would see there to be a bit more

2526
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:27,679
flexibility

2527
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:28,159
to discuss some of the content of the

2528
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,960
work

2529
01:49:28,159 --> 01:49:32,638
first and before deciding how best to

2530
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,040
proceed with that work in the itf if

2531
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:38,159
that was appropriate to do so

2532
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:40,159
um it as it says here it can work on

2533
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:41,440
architectural requirements that's fine i

2534
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:44,000
think it was happy

2535
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,799
and as i said before if there's a need

2536
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,679
to do

2537
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,360
protocol work then one possibility is

2538
01:49:47,679 --> 01:49:50,560
that it might be chartered to do small

2539
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:53,119
bits of protocol work

2540
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:55,119
um if that's appropriate but we would

2541
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:57,199
look at that on a case-by-case basis and

2542
01:49:55,119 --> 01:50:00,159
we'd have discussions with the isg first

2543
01:49:57,199 --> 01:50:00,799
to see if that's okay so um the next

2544
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:03,199
couple of

2545
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,480
slides have the charter text on there

2546
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:04,799
i'm not sure whether we need to bring

2547
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:08,239
that

2548
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:10,239
up um but but

2549
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,919
really the question is now is does

2550
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:14,080
anyone have any comments

2551
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,199
um or points they'd like to raise so i'd

2552
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,040
like to open this up really for

2553
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:18,799
discussion now it might be worth asking

2554
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:21,840
if warren wants to add any more

2555
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,840
color to what i'm saying

2556
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,840
that well thank you

2557
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:36,480
tell us hi yeah thanks for this

2558
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:38,080
so uh this this has been uh wait a lot

2559
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,598
more than the nine months something like

2560
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,880
this should i take the most so

2561
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:45,040
um um so i i do think the

2562
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:46,400
the one area that you know on on quick

2563
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:48,560
look i didn't see

2564
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:49,759
quite was that you know the aspect of

2565
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,840
toi

2566
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:56,719
from you know iot application solutions

2567
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:59,040
to you know people uh doing the network

2568
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:00,880
layer part or the protocol stuff

2569
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:02,560
and vice versa i think that would be a

2570
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:06,400
really cool thing if

2571
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:08,960
we could get more of that right so um

2572
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:09,759
in in in terms of that i would love to

2573
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,800
see you know

2574
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:14,639
uh get getting more outreach to

2575
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:16,480
to to people from the industry

2576
01:51:14,639 --> 01:51:18,239
presenting on their stuff even if you

2577
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,959
know the only outcome is this

2578
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:22,239
this would be a presentation for tui uh

2579
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:25,920
during

2580
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:29,759
such such a meeting and the second

2581
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:32,000
high level comment i think is that um

2582
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:34,000
the the one thing i'm worried about is

2583
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:37,040
to unnecessarily constrain

2584
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,679
things to be called um iot

2585
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:40,719
when they're not and i don't want to

2586
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:42,639
have you know

2587
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,960
a stupid discussion about what the heck

2588
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,920
is iot and what is not iot to stand in

2589
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:48,960
the way but

2590
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:49,440
for uh in in terms of simply using the

2591
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,480
group

2592
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:54,638
for for for the discussion um but then

2593
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,199
you know as appropriate also point out

2594
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:58,239
that

2595
01:51:55,199 --> 01:52:00,480
you know something may not be uh limited

2596
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:01,598
to iot and i think the best example to

2597
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:04,718
me is that

2598
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,880
the you know phil i think was uh

2599
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:07,920
having a good definition of iot which

2600
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,239
was kind of

2601
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:11,520
not the typical devices with with a real

2602
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:13,839
user interface

2603
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,880
uh during this enrollment discussions we

2604
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:18,639
had um

2605
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:20,159
and i think that equally applies to you

2606
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,360
know routers and switches and all the

2607
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:23,920
other networking gear

2608
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:24,480
we had so far um but i don't think we

2609
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,000
have

2610
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:27,519
traditionally called routers and

2611
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,360
switches iot

2612
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,920
um you know big service provider core

2613
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:33,839
router also but i think a lot of

2614
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,000
the you know life cycle management

2615
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:38,239
problems we have for that equipment

2616
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,159
um is very equal to you know what we

2617
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:43,759
would more likely call iot so

2618
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:45,440
um i'm not quite sure how to bring that

2619
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,119
property into the charter but just

2620
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,839
functionally that would be something i'd

2621
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:50,960
become

2622
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:53,199
concerned about okay

2623
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:54,239
to to answer both those two points on

2624
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:57,280
the first one

2625
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:58,559
um yes it's definitely a desire for

2626
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:01,280
people to bring

2627
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,239
like tois and information from other

2628
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,320
places here

2629
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:06,159
so so that is one of the desires that

2630
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:07,920
this is a forum where people can make

2631
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:09,199
those presentations

2632
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:10,639
and that's that's actually one of the

2633
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,080
reasons why we wanted it to be a working

2634
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,800
group rather than just a mailing list

2635
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:16,159
is to have that timely agenda such that

2636
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,239
that those presentations

2637
01:53:16,159 --> 01:53:19,280
could occur so so that's that's

2638
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:21,199
definitely a

2639
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,639
goal here i don't know whether it's

2640
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:24,839
helpful to have anything in the chat

2641
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:27,599
related to that or not

2642
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:29,199
um so that so that's a question to have

2643
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:30,880
or whether it's sufficient

2644
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:33,759
uh just to be able to understand what's

2645
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:36,159
there in terms of the

2646
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,040
second question in terms of defining

2647
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:39,440
what iot is

2648
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:40,159
i think we want to try really hard not

2649
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:43,919
to do that

2650
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:45,598
and i i guess i've given some

2651
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:47,040
partial definition of what it means in

2652
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:48,800
this in this case

2653
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,800
and i think we could be fairly flexible

2654
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,199
with its scope i think mostly

2655
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,400
people will um will know it when they

2656
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:55,919
see it

2657
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:58,080
and we don't need to worry too much

2658
01:53:55,920 --> 01:54:00,960
about it and um

2659
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:02,159
and give the chairs the working group

2660
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:04,400
some flexibility

2661
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,679
in terms of what they define iot and if

2662
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:08,559
it looks like

2663
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:09,920
it's becoming going out of scope then we

2664
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:11,520
can

2665
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:13,119
rein it in again but i think for the

2666
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:15,679
moment

2667
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,559
it'd be better just to have a loose

2668
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:18,239
definition

2669
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,760
see how it progresses and if we need to

2670
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:22,239
tweak anything after

2671
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:24,080
after six months or a year then we can

2672
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:26,239
do so but um

2673
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:29,679
i hope that we can get it set up and

2674
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:31,040
assume that the best intentions first

2675
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:33,440
warren would you like anything to add

2676
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,440
anything to

2677
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,719
so then that to largely agree i think

2678
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:40,400
that you know we've been trying to get

2679
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:40,960
something like this done for a very long

2680
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,638
time

2681
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:44,400
we keep running into the perfect being

2682
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:45,199
the enemy of the good for getting it set

2683
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:48,159
up

2684
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:49,040
and so getting something started so we

2685
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:52,000
can at least

2686
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:53,440
begin discussions um and then you know

2687
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,119
recharge i want to prove

2688
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,960
that we're not completely crazy i think

2689
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:59,839
would be a

2690
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,440
safer way to go um for obvious reasons

2691
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,480
you know there's a number of concerns

2692
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,960
about

2693
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:05,759
stroke creep or just trying to take over

2694
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,440
what is

2695
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,880
being done in other areas and i think

2696
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:12,080
that's where some of the

2697
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,080
sensitivity is coming from

2698
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:17,199
yeah as i said i didn't mean to i was i

2699
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,280
i was explicitly saying let's not

2700
01:55:17,199 --> 01:55:20,320
take my comment as something to to make

2701
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:24,239
life harder

2702
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:27,599
but rather be you know more inclusive so

2703
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:30,839
as to not partition

2704
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:33,840
the discussion unnecessarily along the

2705
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:33,840
definition

2706
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:37,040
yes it sounds fine

2707
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:44,159
okay before elliot gets this

2708
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:45,280
lining queue there was a question from

2709
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:48,400
eric on the

2710
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:51,119
chat basically asking if this

2711
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,480
iot ops working group would render the

2712
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:55,519
iot directorate

2713
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:59,040
kind of obsolete or basically how they

2714
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:59,040
consequences their interactions are

2715
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:04,960
so my answers i would assume not i

2716
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:07,360
would assume that the iot directorate um

2717
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:10,159
still serves very useful purpose

2718
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:12,080
for um doing reviews of documents that

2719
01:56:10,159 --> 01:56:14,000
iot related i'd rather those go to an

2720
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:15,280
iot directorate rather than coming to

2721
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,840
this working group

2722
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:18,639
so i'd see that continuing i i don't

2723
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,080
know

2724
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:21,440
exactly everything that goes on in the

2725
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:22,719
iot directory i've only joined it

2726
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:24,320
relatively recently

2727
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:25,840
i know some of the sort of discussion

2728
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:28,159
and coordination is happening there

2729
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:29,119
it may end up that that this is a better

2730
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:32,480
forum for that

2731
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:32,480
if that answers your questionnaire

2732
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:36,320
so so no i don't think it should be

2733
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,040
obsoleted i do think we should just see

2734
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:40,080
how it

2735
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:42,880
um how it progresses

2736
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,400
once this so this is warren yeah i mean

2737
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,520
i think it's more sort of complementary

2738
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:48,559
and kind of like what

2739
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:50,480
um mcr said in the chat um you know

2740
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:52,960
maybe the coordination calls become more

2741
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,959
sag like

2742
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,840
um

2743
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:03,280
um so we have only four minutes left so

2744
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,280
elliot

2745
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,639
i'll just be brief and say that i i

2746
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:10,638
think this is perfectly fine

2747
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:13,920
idea i think it's actually way overdue

2748
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:16,880
and i i think uh warren and and rob

2749
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,599
and all of those preceding area

2750
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:20,639
directors

2751
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:24,080
have taken a swing at this um

2752
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:26,400
the uh the text to me is is good

2753
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:27,199
um the only thing i will just add is

2754
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:30,719
that

2755
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:33,199
this i i do view the iot ops

2756
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,840
stuff more as you know to make sure that

2757
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:36,559
the

2758
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,880
the left two aspects right it's a locus

2759
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,880
for

2760
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:40,320
new work so that you know people want to

2761
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,679
come into the ietf they can

2762
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:43,519
at least hear about what's going on in

2763
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,920
iot and then maybe bring some work along

2764
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,719
there

2765
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:48,719
on their own the second is to keep us

2766
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:52,800
from tripping over ourselves

2767
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:55,199
um and and to that end uh there's uh

2768
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,400
just approving the working group will

2769
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:58,719
get us there

2770
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,519
we will need it's necessary but not

2771
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:00,960
sufficient

2772
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,599
it will need to be the case that the

2773
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:05,199
iesg and everybody have to sort of

2774
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:07,360
do some outreach to make sure that

2775
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,759
anything that you know really is iot

2776
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:10,400
like

2777
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:11,679
at least gets you know discussed brought

2778
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:13,199
in for discussion

2779
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,880
you know not not so much that the work

2780
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,759
gets done in iot ops but just that

2781
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,760
people are aware

2782
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,880
of how it all fits together and people

2783
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,080
need to to

2784
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,159
come together and be in that room for

2785
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:23,599
that purpose and that will require a

2786
01:58:22,159 --> 01:58:35,839
little bit of work and it's it's a

2787
01:58:23,599 --> 01:58:35,840
little counter cultural

2788
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:49,840
so i think that sounds fine and it

2789
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:49,840
i think that all makes sense

2790
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,400
sorry

2791
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,839
tell us

2792
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:04,320
okay let's consider the mic closed

2793
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:09,840
so i think um i think that sounds

2794
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:12,159
everything thank you for the feedback

2795
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,880
and and hopefully we'll be able to get

2796
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:20,000
this up and running soon

2797
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:20,000
so i'll just try and find the link for

2798
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:34,159
the ops area

2799
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,159
upset the office hours

2800
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:40,400
so in case anyone wants to join warren i

2801
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,840
will be here for the next

2802
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:44,638
half an hour so i'll just put that into

2803
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,159
the chat but otherwise i think we can

2804
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:59,840
call the ops area part of the meeting

2805
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:59,839
also closed thank you everyone fitter

2806
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:40,159
you
