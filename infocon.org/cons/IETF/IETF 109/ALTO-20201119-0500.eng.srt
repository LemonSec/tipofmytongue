1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,239
so i

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,519

great

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
then the other thing i need to make sure

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,000

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
the ietf

82
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,200
general rule set which basically says

83
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
if you are aware of any ipr or if you're

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,238

85
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,159

applies which basically means

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
the two the itf used to use a lot when

172
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
we were

173
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,840
you know at actual physical meetings and

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
we didn't use meat echo and now we have

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
meat echo and everything is being

176
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,159
recorded

177
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,239
so the main reason for the javascript

178
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
for me is if somebody

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,080
is yeah so actually i i don't know if

180
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,520
the possibility would be that somebody

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,359
is logged in and he cannot

182
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
post in the chat here and meet echo and

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,560
he needs to use

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
java um so so young the the chat and

185
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
meet echo

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,318
is jabber and so the purpose of

187
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,758
the purpose of having a jabra scribe is

188
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,880
if the chairs do not

189
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,520
feel equipped to monitor the jabber

190
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,440
at the same time is sharing the meeting

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,560
so the the purpose of the jabra scribe

192
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,039
is to

193
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,440
mention important stuff in jabber

194
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,199
because no one else is going to

195
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,520
okay i was going to say the main reason

196
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
is to so if somebody raises a hand in

197
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,240
the in the chat that

198
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
we we don't miss it um so so i was gonna

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,280
ask chin can you have a

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,840
look at the um at the at the chat

201
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,960
yeah yeah i have already logged into the

202
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,359
author chapter i haven't seen anybody

203
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,840
so i i i can forward the any jabra

204
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,840
discussion

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,160
can you see me in it oh let me check

206
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
actually i haven't logged in

207
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,599
i think that's clarified as well

208
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,520
wonderful okay great um

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,960
i think we are we are we have the

210
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,878
logistics set up

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,640
this meeting is being recorded i

212
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,959
notified everybody about the note well

213
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,598
we

214
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,478
i introduced our new chair we have note

215
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
takers

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,159
we clarified the javascript thing

217
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,279
so yeah let's let's talk about our

218
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,760
working group what what

219
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,760
what's going on so i think everybody is

220
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,519
fully aware that we have two big

221
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
topics and that's what what this slide

222
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,800
basically says

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,199
on one side we want to finalize our

224
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,359
charter items

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
and we are making good progress i talk

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,560
about that on the next slides

227
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,360
and assuming that we make even better

228
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
progress we

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
we are in the midst of discussing a

230
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,040
recharger so the reason for the

231
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,439
rechartered discussion is obvious once

232
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,160
we

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,519
finalize the current milestones normally

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,959
there are only two options either the

235
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,240
working group is finished and

236
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,839
ends or there's lots lots of interesting

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,279
stuff that still needs to be done and we

238
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,440
need to recharter them

239
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,959
and my impression is clearly that we

240
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
have a lot of energy we have

241
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
lots of people with good ideas and we

242
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
had a recharger discussion already last

243
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
time and

244
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
in the meantime the people who are

245
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,599
working hard on this

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,839
have really putting a lot of effort uh

247
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,040
to focus this discussion so i think

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,640
we're gonna have a good recharge

249
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,640
discussion today and that's what we want

250
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,279
to focus most of our time

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,439
and if you look at the next slide oops

252
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,519
sorry

253
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
um so the agenda has been set up

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,760
accordingly so i will talk about

255
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,600
presented share slides uh uh this on the

256
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,439

257
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,800
little bit about the current

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
milestone and their current status

259
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,479
what's going on we've had

260
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
lots of working-class calls and we've

261
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
had lots of

262
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,519
revisions lately and so we're going to

263
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,720
talk about that

264
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,640
and after that we got to have a

265
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
recharger discussion um

266
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
where we have some presentations that

267
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,720

269
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,360
that are on this recharger discussion

270
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
and also richard posted a link on the

271
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
mailing list that i want to

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
highlight with the current recharter

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
proposed text

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,399
let's work in progress text so and but

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,120
people can have a look at it and we're

276
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,279
going to discuss that

277
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,120
so regarding our general progress the

278
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,439
last meeting was itf one way there was a

279
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,160
virtual itf meeting just as this one is

280
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,320
and during the due to the corona m

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,199
crisis i think everybody is fully aware

282
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,680
of that

283
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
and we have published two rfcs since our

284
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,560
last um

285
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,399
uh gathering together um which is great

286
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,239
so we have the course calendar published

287
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,120

authors

292
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,040
and i think that's a big step forward

293
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
for us um

294
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
two important work items and milestones

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
that we had

296
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,399
um so yeah we're making good progress

297
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,560
and we have

298
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,920
four remaining milestones now and i'll

299
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,680
talk about each of them on the next

300
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,760
slides and you can see them here it's

301
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,359
the cdni work the path vector

302
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,720
performance metrics and unified

303
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,399
properties

304
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,240
documents and regarding alto cdna

305
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,200
request routing this is the one that has

306
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,839
been done or

307
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,399
finished i think the for the longest

308
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,920
time um

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
actually we finished the working glass

310
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
call in the zero nine version there have

311
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,560
been no objections we had

312
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
quite a lot of comments we have

313
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,518
addressed them all i'm saying we because

314
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,439
i'm a co-author of this document

315
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,079
um and yeah speaking as chair now

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,839
um the current version zero 14 and i

317
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,760
think uh um yeah the current version

318
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
zero 14 is ready to go

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,480
um the only reason why we're not uh

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,800
moving forward with it right now is that

321
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,959
we

322
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,639
agreed that we want to move it as a

323
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,079
bundle with the unified properties

324
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,240
document because

325
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,439
it kind of relates to that and we want

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,680
to make sure that these

327
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,839
two get published together so basically

328
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,519
it's ready and we're just holding it and

329
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,200
we chairs already started with a

330
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,160
shepherd write-up so vijay is the

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,279
shepherd for this

332
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
um document because i'm a co-author and

333
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,760
but i've been

334
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,079
exchanging emails with him and he's

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,760
already making progress on that so the

336
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,800
shepherd write up is actually almost

337
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
ready

338
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,399
so yeah essentially this is done we're

339
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,360
just waiting for unified properties to

340
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,120
move ahead

341
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,519
and chin you made a good comment in an

342
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
email i think i it was not animating

343
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,880
this but

344
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,800
sent privately to me or the authors and

345
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
that we need to make sure that unified

346
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,359
properties is then also

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
a normative reference in this document

348
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,000
um it's a good comment maybe you can

349
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,519
resend it that we don't forget it i

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,200
am um yeah i guess that's the case that

351
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
also rfc editor will notice

352
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,399
so in the shepard writer we usually make

353
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,638
sure that there are

354
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
no non-normative references in the

355
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,320
normative references section

356
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,000
if it's the other way around that we

357
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,320
reference a

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
current draft that will requires a

359
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
bundle and we also be published as an

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
rfc

361
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,800
i think rfc editor will will

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
take care of that but martin is also

363
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,160
more the expert here but i think it will

364
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
not be an issue

365
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,160
i don't think there's a way that rfc

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,279
editor would oversee this

367
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,560
um yeah so

368
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,160
so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah how has you

369
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,000
as you mentioned actually i

370
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,319
yeah can you go back to yes yeah i i

371
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,480
said

372
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah as you mentioned i already you know

373
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
uh uh

374
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
send a private email to you and i will

375
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,800
you know uh

376
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,839
posted my comments to the list

377
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,160
to reminder the uh

378
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
sitting i dropped the author to make

379
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,680
update actually

380
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,319
so main commerce actually is suggested

381
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,800
to

382
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
you know move unified property from

383
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,160
informative reference to the normative

384
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
reference

385
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,800
yeah correct yes and that's a good

386
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,079
comment and we need to take care of that

387
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,000
but um the problem always is uh

388
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,760
once we send it out to rfc editor the

389
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,040
the unified properties will not be an

390
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,439
rfc

391
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,599
yet either so we have to make sure that

392
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,000
rc editor notices it but i think it's a

393
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,839
common

394
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
thing that two rfcs get published

395
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,600
together and you need to make sure there

396
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,959
are normative references

397
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,040
and yeah we'll take care of that

398
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,800
um okay regarding part vector

399
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
so we had a working glass call in the

400
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,920
since last itf on the zero

401
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
11 version and more on the uh sorry on

402
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,319
the

403
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,160
version 11. and we had two individual

404
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
reviews thanks to danny and luis

405
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
um for for working hard and giving good

406
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,199
comments

407
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,440
um so vijay has been shepherding this

408
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,359
document and he's not here so i am i

409
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,279
want to make sure that we have addressed

410
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,160
our comments and what the status is can

411
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,279
the authors

412
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,959
at least confirm i mean what is have i

413
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
my assumption is that in the zero uh

414
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
sorry in the uh

415
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,120
version 12 you have addressed all

416
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,120
comments is that the case

417
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,439
i think akai is trying to give a comment

418
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,360
right and and also

419
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
i think so too he's trying to speak but

420
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,399
i think he's muted

421
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,920
or okay

422
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,839
yeah kai you should unmute your odoo

423
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,839
sen clickly like a

424
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
oh couldn't figure out

425
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,719
hello yeah we can tell you about the

426
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,959
very low voice

427
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,560
okay i just uh try to speak louder yeah

428
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,439
it's very quiet

429
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
all the comments in the latest revision

430
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,240
but

431
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,920
after the submission we should also

432
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,000
propose some new changes

433
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:13,360
so can you speak close to the mic

434
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
yeah i can close your mic

435
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:22,240
[Music]

436
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,959
so is it better now

437
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,279
a little bit better but still very far

438
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,560
from

439
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,040
the latest revision um and

440
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,599
uh but after the submission richard also

441
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,199
gave

442
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,920
some other uh comments so

443
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,839
we might just let's see uh he also

444
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,680
proposed some changes to

445
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,959
address some comments so we might

446
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,920
accommodate the changes

447
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,359
after uh basically after the new

448
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,279
submission window is open and then we

449
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
will submit

450
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,360
right so uh by the way kai you you

451
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,720
probably want to try to figure out how

452
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,040
you're handling a microphone i think a

453
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,079
chi props amount of very few people

454
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,120
who use this linux and open time you

455
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,599
have all kinds of

456
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,280
issues and so on so because otherwise

457
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,280
you you'll present later i don't know

458
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:16,160
yeah how about right now yeah yeah

459
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:19,599
okay yeah it's better it just oh cool

460
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,400
cool yeah so basically let me clarify

461
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,079
and i think uh the small issue is the

462
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,319
following uh there there there

463
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,678
there's various very very uh good

464
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
comments from luis

465
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,880
from the last review and i think kai

466
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,760
addresses the reviews and i also address

467
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,600
the reviews

468
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
there's some like overlapping part so

469
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,399
therefore we address slightly

470
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
differently and so on so i think we need

471
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,160
to kai and i we need to go over

472
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,000
the our uh basically the uh revision and

473
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,039
murder of revision in the final version

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
i think that's that's all

475
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,559
right i think that's the one so

476
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,399
basically just make sure we

477
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,760
both of our revisions will be merged

478
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
into a single coherent one so we

479
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,879
slightly took a slightly different way

480
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,160
to address lewis but i think

481
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,880
i checked my uh uh my answers with luis

482
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,640
i think i

483
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,799
believe replied i think louise said if

484
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,000
he was okay with my comments

485
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,679
i think uh kayaking there also some come

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,280
very nice

487
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,440
revision by kai very nice we just need

488
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,559
to very quickly probably write up ipf

489
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,760
maybe take a

490
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,559
couple days we'll finalize it

491
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,280
but they're not hacking mostly they are

492
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,240
uh

493
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
awarding you not like potential okay

494
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,799
thanks richard that would that would

495
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,400
have been my question so

496
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,400
i'm also under the assumption that there

497
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,160
are no technical issues that we

498
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,039
need to discuss right here now and there

499
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,720
are also no this also implies that there

500
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,799
does not need to be another working

501
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
class call so basically it's editorial

502
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,320
things

503
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,520
and that you as authors need to sort out

504
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,280
okay so great

505
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,520
so then please do that as soon as you

506
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
can so we are taking notes oh by the way

507
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,600
by the way yeah i think one of the

508
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,760
review is provided by charlie not any

509
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,678
oh i'm sorry then maybe that's the cut

510
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,799
and paste error on the slides

511
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,360
when i did them yeah probably that is

512
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,879
possible

513
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,120
i'm sorry um that can very well be

514
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
and so that actually the reason why that

515
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,080
where this

516
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
error on my side happened is that that

517
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,879
there has been lots of

518
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,559
traffic on the mailing list lately and

519
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,200
that's that's a good thing

520
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,480
um so and we've had many working-class

521
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,640
calls so maybe that's a

522
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,840
cut and paste error i apologize um

523
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,679
yeah so but but uh uh to to wrap this up

524
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,559
so we are also um vijay and i have

525
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,520
already um

526
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,399
started the shepherd write-up and um so

527
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,879
we are um

528
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,480
we are good to go here so basically my

529
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
assumption is the working last call is

530
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,440
over no objections are there

531
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,039
and you have already started addressing

532
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,080
all the comments in the 12 version but

533
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,520
you need to

534
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,439
do another round so please do it as

535
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,120
quickly as you can but there are no

536
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
technical issues that we need to discuss

537
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,799
here that have been raised

538
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,520
and also that means there does not need

539
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,559
to have been another working glass call

540
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,600
um okay great

541
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,639
so so yeah uh for past available

542
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
actually i did

543
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,360
have a quicker review to this draft

544
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,760
i i think this path vector is a you know

545
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,120
very important worker in the old working

546
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,360
group because the

547
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,199
original base uh order protocol is

548
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,080
designed for the peer selection now we

549
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,840
actually

550
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,399
move toward to the path selection so

551
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,600
pass vector is a funimation worker for

552
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
this uh

553
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,799
uh so it's very important to deliver

554
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
work but

555
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,080
i have additional comments because i i

556
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,000
didn't rate the

557
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,120
abstract i i think it would be desirable

558
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
to split it into several paragraph i uh

559
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,760
i can you know send my proposal to the

560
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,879
list

561
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,400
to have the author uh to

562
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,520
uh maybe also to con take a look at that

563
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,000
we can uh to try to make abstract more

564
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,000
clearer

565
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,200
and more shorter that would be great

566
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,600
of course yes in addition

567
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,240
i'm just wondering uh what for the next

568
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
step do you think uh

569
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,080
it will be good to cross cross post to

570
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,879
some other working group like a pc or we

571
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,158
need to

572
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,360
ask some uh uh directory like a routine

573
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,320
director to to

574
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,120
give a quick review all this is a all

575
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,960
the next step

576
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,039
since after working with law school

577
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,720
my my assumption is this is after

578
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,400
working with last call so my assumption

579
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,480
is we move it out of the outer working

580
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
group because we have a consensus here

581
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
and we have agreed on it

582
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
and the process is pretty clear in the

583
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,720
itf all

584
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,520
iesg members will review the document

585
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,640
so um that's the normal process we have

586
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
and i think it works

587
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,200
as well here martin do you want to add

588
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
something

589
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,799
yeah so you can you can always request

590
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,959
cross area review it's actually just the

591
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,440
button in data tracker if you want um

592
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,440
ops or whoever to look at it um you just

593
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,799
ask and it goes into their queue

594
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
so you don't have to wait for it i mean

595
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,639
you could do it like

596
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,559
on a zero zero draft if you want it's

597
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
it's totally um

598
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,760
uh you don't have to wait till after

599
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,639
working class call

600
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,480
or yeah i understand but i guess but the

601
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
point here is since we are

602
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
really really really close to being done

603
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,639
with this one do we want to have this

604
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,760
cross directory review triggered or uh

605
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
manually now by us

606
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
or do we just push it out of the working

607
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,600
group because it's going to happen then

608
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,039
anyway

609
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,360
doing the isg review right so well so

610
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,520
when first we have itf last call which

611
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,360
um is probably which is actually the

612
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
best opportunity to get good cross-area

613
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,719
view

614
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,679
it is true that iesg is also across area

615
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
view

616
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,880
but it's a different person so if you

617
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
want like the right ops person to look

618
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,720
at it i would suggest that

619
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,678
in in last call you request an officer

620
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,880
interview

621
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
they might just do it on their own

622
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,360
anyway but you can request okay

623
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
well then that's verified then please

624
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,639
for the note takers also let's take a

625
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,520
note that we do this

626
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
and we were so i think chin this also

627
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,480
asks you a question

628
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,760
answers your your comment or your

629
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,559
proposal then

630
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,840
we will request it during itf last call

631
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,080
great

632
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,879
okay yeah okay um

633
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,080
yeah so again authors of path vector and

634
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
please um

635
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
finalize this as soon as you can so that

636
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,280
we can

637
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,840
really get this done before we recharge

638
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,840
her that would be great

639
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,320
performance metrics so this one um i

640
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,200
would like to get some feedback from the

641
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
authors so

642
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
um i had a close look we had a

643
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,960
working-class call on the 12 version

644
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,720
therefore no objections which is great

645
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,840
but we have the three individual

646
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
reviewers um

647
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,360
thanks to kai danny and jensen i think

648
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,000
these this time the

649
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:49,120
reverse are correct that i wrote here um

650
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,960
and um yeah my understanding is that the

651
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,559
authors are still working on revising

652
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,279
the documents so

653
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,879
um as far as i saw on the on the mailing

654
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,279
list but also in the data track and a

655
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,840
new version has not been posted yet

656
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,520
um i also had a look at preparing the

657
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
shepherd writer when i found some

658
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,279
normative references issues that you

659
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,640
should fix i posted it on the mailing

660
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,200
list as well so please have a look

661
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,520
richard

662
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,799
yes right that's right so basically

663
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,879
we're addressing

664
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,840
some of the comments and i think we

665
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,360
missed because

666
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,959
wrestling reviews and basically i i took

667
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,439
some responsibility

668
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,159
you know since i think i missed the

669
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
review

670
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,240
from i found out i found out that there

671
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
there were reviews by jameson

672
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,880
uh like uh two or three weeks ago during

673
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,120
the weekly meeting and i realized i was

674
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
missing some emails from jensen to the

675
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,399
auto meetings so therefore

676
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,919
therefore i i i started to really

677
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,039
address it then i missed the

678
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,760
the we missed the deadline of the update

679
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,879
so

680
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,520
we do not want to read up for example

681
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,760
right away

682
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,960
during ietf week but we will finish all

683
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
the reviews

684
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,159
we don't see any techno technical

685
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
comments i believe they are mostly

686
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
clarification issues and of course the

687
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,880
nominal mutual

688
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
address and so give us basically one

689
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,640
week of

690
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,279
atf and we will send upload the final

691
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,919
version and then you can do the red tap

692
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,520
great so thanks richard for that uh

693
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
summary this is exactly what

694
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,480
what i was hoping for

695
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,840
um and it's good that you also pointed

696
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,440
out there are no technical issues that's

697
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,840
also my understanding

698
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,080
so basically there's a many editorial

699
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
comments that you just need to work out

700
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,158
um and great yeah please if you can do

701
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
it as soon as you can that would be

702
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,880
great

703
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
um i've already prepared a shepherd

704
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,320
write-up and so it's almost done

705
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,640
um and then we just need to uh i need to

706
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,678
just

707
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,200
ask the ipr question to all authors and

708
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,000
then we are pretty much done with this

709
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,440
one

710
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,559
um great okay

711
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,840
so moving to

712
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,440
unified properties um

713
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,120
we had a working class call in the 12

714
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,000
version we again we have two individual

715
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,199
reviewers

716
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,200

723
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200

724
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,080
green in the tool i don't know if you

725
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,520
wanted to

726
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
if you spoke up but maybe you were just

727
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,679
setting up your two you might no no

728

answer to your questions so all the

730
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,360
comments have been addressed

731
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,559
uh we posted the version 14

732
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,479
a couple of days ago uh

733
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,480
because there were a couple of uh

734
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,559
pending comments from luis

735
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,919
so thank you to luis and danny for the

736
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,200
review

737
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:57,600
we uh what misses is just

738
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,919
the one table uh that summarizes that

739
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:05,039
is listing all the new features that are

740
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,000
uh introduced and we want to put this in

741
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,600
the beginning of the

742
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,520
document and so we with the jensen we

743
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,199
have prepared the list and the

744
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,879
just the references to the text sections

745
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,480
and we will inject it

746
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,919
like tomorrow or

747
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:26,320
let's say monday so this is we we just

748
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,200
need to make the edits

749
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,039
okay thank you also here for the for the

750
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,640
good summary and again i

751
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,158
my understanding is that these are

752
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,600
non-technical issues that we need to

753
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,039
discuss here it's

754
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,678
um editorial issues and so

755
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,399
yeah please as soon as you can and do

756
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,159
this

757
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,239
but my understanding is also this one is

758
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,919
done you just you publish a new version

759
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,760
with the last outstanding editorial

760
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,279
issues i've saw some emails also on the

761
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,440
mailing list regarding this table i

762
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,480
think bj gave some comments

763
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,399
um and uh vj already posted a shepherd

764
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,360
write up so he has it ready

765
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,799
so um yeah we are also very good to go

766
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,039
here

767
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,720
um yeah so in summary i think all the

768
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,080
remaining milestones we

769
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
are really really close now to to being

770
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,279
done we have

771
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,559
finished working glass corner call on

772
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,600

773
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,320

thank you for this report on

778
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,159
on how it's going uh and i just could i

779
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
ask the chairs to update the state and

780
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,760
data tracker correctly for all these

781
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,840
documents it's kind of like

782
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,879
where i usually remind myself where

783
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,199
things are and

784
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
and um i'm going to reach for that much

785
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,159
sooner than i'll reach

786
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,279
my notes from this meeting thank you yes

787
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,120
and trend

788
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,559
notice this thank you very much for that

789
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,439
comment we need to do that i'll take a

790
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,918
note

791
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,279
um yeah so so yeah actually i have a

792
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,320
additional comments for this

793
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,399
job i also think this dropped you know

794
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,039
more major enough actually you know he

795
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,719
is a reusing component actually can be

796
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,840
used by the cdni

797
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,919
and also pass vector so but uh uh i

798
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
my suggestion maybe we should align with

799
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
the passive vector

800
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,320
job because for the title you know for

801
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,360
unified property

802
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,120
what is the unified so i i know this

803
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,039
you know unified property really you

804
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,279
know extended and uh

805
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,440
endpoint property try to generalize this

806
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,240
endpoint property better than the naming

807
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,880
maybe

808
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
you know not very clear maybe you know

809
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,399
just

810
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:32,240
you know uh use a similar title as

811
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:35,120
uh uh as a pass vector actually

812
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,080
uh that will be uh more more easily

813
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,199
understand

814
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,879
understood um

815
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,480
i have personally no problem with it but

816
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,279
i guess it's a question also to the

817
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,000
authors um or to the working group

818
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,440
if we want to change the title um maybe

819
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,880
changing title to the property

820
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,320
mapper uh i don't know

821
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,240
yeah it's a good question um sabine do

822
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,480
you want to comment

823
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,480
um

824
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
or any of the authors do you have any

825
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,679
any

826
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,678
um yeah any feedback

827
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,719
um yeah hello

830
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:30,000
uh the title uh for this uh

831
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,880
document and so well

832
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,600

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:43,199
that brings um like that like if the

835
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,200
title lacks clarity we can reconsider it

836
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,679
and we'll have a discussion with a

837
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,760

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:07,120
as soon as possible okay

846
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,039
perfect yeah that sounds good to me

847
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,399
exactly clarified on the list i i have

848
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,360
no objections

849
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,199
um and i guess it's it's also very good

850
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,760
comment if the title is clearer that's

851
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
good

852
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,799
but of course the authors need to be

853
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,320
involved and that's let's have the

854
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,960
discussion on the mailing list

855
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,360
okay but also that is for me it's not

856
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,600
it's

857
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,439
of course it's a non-technical issue so

858
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,639
it doesn't um

859
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,000
um well it it's still in line with what

860
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,399
i said before that we are

861
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,120
done with all the remaining milestones

862
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,199
we have

863
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,039
we are done with working class call and

864
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
we are really really close to publishing

865
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,919
these

866
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,240
and and we will update the status on the

867
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,440
on the data tracker i took a note

868
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,440
um yeah so that that um um

869
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,720
that's good and and we are actually

870
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,240
perfectly in time we

871
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,039
we set this goal it's going to take half

872
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,000
an hour and it exactly took half an hour

873
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,679
um so the question is we i would now

874
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,559
move to the recharger discussion but

875
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,840
before we do that

876
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,399
the question is is there any other

877
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,559
business anything uh

878
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
and that we forgot to mention to address

879
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,840
so yeah i don't know if i should make

880
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,639
this comment or not i think we really

881
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,678
should have

882
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,919
a party or whatever to thank

883
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,799
you and vegeta for being a wonderful

884
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,799
oh thank you

885
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,639
thank you very much yeah we should

886
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
i know that other working groups do this

887
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,559
kind of thing where if we would have

888
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,760
physical itf meetings for sure we should

889
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,039
we would go for a drink yes um now we

890
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,039
will have virtual drinks

891
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,518
yeah i guess it's a

892
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,840
thank you very much i think it's a good

893
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,039
idea if we will have a physical meeting

894
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,559
soon again we should maybe have a gap

895
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,039
together that's a good idea

896
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,559
i think right right because the reason i

897
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,039
want at this point is

898
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,000
given that and uh young and vegeta i

899
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,640
don't know who

900
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,440
might need to you know and for example

901
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,279
uh

902
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,720
switch a little bit and because i really

903
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,880
want to say that

904
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
i think uh the both vg and young are

905
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,559
just wonderful cheers to

906
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,159
organize this for example just look at

907
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,918
how we organize all these working group

908
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,559
documents and then

909
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,159
greater leadership uh in particular for

910
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,879
example as a good example

911
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,360
lately we were writing this recharger

912
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,159
text

913
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,158
and we we read the current version and

914
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,320
just incredible clear

915
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,240
direction about what charters would be

916
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,080
and then of course always very steady

917
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,399
and very well organized just wonderful i

918
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
think

919
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,479
really as a working group we probably

920
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,320
should set this one up as some kind of

921
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,159
probably informal business to appreciate

922
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,399
i'm sorry thank you very much it's uh

923
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,840
yeah i appreciate it and i will also i

924
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,879
think vijay does too i will

925
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,519
um talk with him about it um thanks a

926
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,720
lot

927
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,279
and i will take a reminder if if we have

928
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,840
a

929
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,080
physical meeting soon who knows with the

930
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,158
vaccinations coming out maybe you know

931
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,720
already and i we're going to have an itf

932
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,760
meeting sooner than we think again in

933
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:12,079
an actual at an actual location

934
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,280
um we we can celebrate for sure yeah

935
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,679
yeah so so yeah yes yeah yeah

936
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
so i think a richer speaker might was i

937
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,800
i think

938
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,280
uh i i think yeah we have fantastic team

939
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,119
actually

940
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,720
also we have very experienced chair and

941
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,040
without you we cannot you know

942
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,560
get so far so if we can have the

943
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,440
face-to-face meeting actually we can

944
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,879
have beer to

945
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,480
celebrate yeah yeah

946
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,000
yeah let's discuss it on the mailing

947
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,079
list we should have

948
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,918
why don't we do this once the remaining

949
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,240
four milestones have been published also

950
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,480
as

951
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,839
rfcs we're going to set up a a

952
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,520

most of

960
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,440
course by the authors but also sharing

961
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,280

962
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,640
yeah it's a good mice it's a big

963
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,839
milestone if we have

964
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,240

968
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,440
good point

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,040
um yeah

970
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,760

than i might but regarding upcoming um

974
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,760
itf meetings i think the official

schedule is itf march will still be

976
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,560

977
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,319
july uh next summer is

978
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,640

982
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,280

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,359
we were clarified very clearly by steve

984
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,880
comes one all this conference on 2

985
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:08,078
september would be virtual september

986
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,920
next year yeah yeah yeah and probably

987
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,079
that's realistic

988
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,000
i guess i guess that's realistic um

989
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,240
summer is maybe i'm too hopeful for

990
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,079
summer already yes

991
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,680
okay but let's let's get to the

992
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,079
recharger discussion thank you richard

993
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,879
for this comment i appreciate it um

994
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,800
let's get to the recharger discussion so

995
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,200
um

996
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,760
yeah how are we going to do this um you

997
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,879
guys uploaded slides do you want to

998
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,800
go through the items and then

999
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,000
briefly present five minutes your slides

1000
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,280
and then have a discussion on each

1001
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
item i guess that's how we're going to

1002
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
do this right

1003
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,640
yeah i i think yeah as we uh

1004
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,759
discussed overnight maybe yeah we

1005
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,480
maybe we need to just focus on the child

1006
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,599
charter you know uh text proposal text

1007
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,040
and uh

1008
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,760
if uh we have any

1009
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,880
you know uh detail we need to get a

1010
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
detailed

1011
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,920
discussion we can you know run the

1012
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,119
slides

1013
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,040
i i think uh

1014
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,800
yeah uh so richard so so we will uh

1015
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,320
open your google doc and uh to discuss

1016
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,079
uh proposal one by one because uh

1017
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,079
in uh offline discussion in the design

1018
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,280
team meeting we actually

1019
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,680
set the order for the proposed charter

1020
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
text

1021
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,000
you know right i think you you set up

1022
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,440
this order like overview

1023
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,040
i think you'll give a very quick uh

1024
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,560
for other people who who did not attend

1025
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,560
the meeting like uh

1026
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,160
every tuesday nowadays and i think

1027
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,759
probably basically

1028
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,000
last tuesday which is like around two

1029
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,800
days ago and i think we did agree on

1030
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,240
that order will be qing would give the

1031
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
overview and then

1032
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,640
each one of the champion will give a i

1033
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
think we talk about i think

1034
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,680
and young you'll give us like 10 minutes

1035
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,520
to go over

1036
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,319
our some details and then post

1037
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,720
the paragraph text is that right and of

1038
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
course

1039
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,799
those attacks occur they're like

1040
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
beginning and those are

1041
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,079
will not be discussed because they're

1042
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
shared so we essentially the champion

1043
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,760
would go over

1044
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,720
the individual five paragraphs i believe

1045
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,200
that was the

1046
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,319
instruction you would ask here yes yes

1047
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,319
all right

1048
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,720
that's that's how we how we will try

1049
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,119
this so it just for everybody to to be

1050
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,160
clear

1051
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,560
and i just um shared now this um

1052
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,680
proposed charter text or the the current

1053
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,440
text on the table

1054
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,118
richard has also posted this link on the

1055
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,880
mailing list so everybody um

1056
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,920
you should be able to access this google

1057
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,839
docs text that i'm sharing here yourself

1058
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,280
so it's it's the link has been posted on

1059
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:50,480
the mailing list

1060
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,480
um so

1061
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
um yeah shouldn't go ahead do you want

1062
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,560
to share slides

1063
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,400
um you should be able to yeah maybe you

1064
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,560
you can switch it to my screen yeah now

1065
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,520
you can

1066
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,200
yeah discuss yeah so i will stop sharing

1067
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,200
slides and then you can go ahead

1068
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,400
um

1069
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,400
you sh it's still showing my

1070
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:29,839
screen stop still okay now

1071
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,839
okay okay okay

1072
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,280
okay can you say my scream

1073
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,960
perfect yeah okay

1074
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,599
so uh as we discussed actually we want

1075
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
to set an

1076
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,599
order for these several topics yeah i

1077
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,920
haven't followed

1078
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,599
the previous discussion we have 15

1079
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,240
proposals now we you know converge you

1080
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,520
actually

1081
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,959
have a vibrable i i think we make a lot

1082
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,160
of progress and uh

1083
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,240
so the reason to set this order we think

1084
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,680
uh you know based on the maturity of

1085
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,078
each proposal and

1086
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,399
and also based on the dependency of this

1087
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,040
proposal so we set this order

1088
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,760
uh the first proposal is a cellular

1089
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,200
network

1090
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,599
exposure proposed by uh chen chung and

1091
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,640
from tencent and gandhi from china

1092
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,240
mobile

1093
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,118
and i i think uh you know foundation uh

1094
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,319
for this cellular network exposure is

1095
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,440
3gbp worker

1096
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,319
they you know they focus on to define

1097
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,040
network exposure uh function

1098
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,240
architecture

1099
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,920
and requirements and related api so this

1100
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,279
will provide the foundation for this

1101
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,800
cellular network exposure and the second

1102
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,440
proposal is about the general extension

1103
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,079
which is proposed by the saving from

1104
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,200
nokia

1105
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,200
and i i think this is you know as

1106
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,680
luis mentioned this is you know

1107
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,640
optimization to the existing protocol we

1108
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,279
now we already have uh uh you know past

1109
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,720
vector

1110
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,520
uh chapter which help you to

1111
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,240
to to do the past selection and we may

1112
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,359
need

1113
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,598
additional pieces to to help you

1114
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:21,200
uh to to optimize this path selection

1115
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,960
and uh so so so we'll uh ask her

1116
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,439
sabine to introduce his proposal and uh

1117
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,119
another uh one is about a new

1118
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,160
transporter you know for base

1119
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,680
auto protocol you know it originally

1120
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,920
you know designed for the p2p

1121
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,640
application setting application and

1122
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,599
build on top of the http one now we have

1123
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,960
hdb2 and hd3 and also we have quicker

1124
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,839
so how we can migrate from http 1 to

1125
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,040
http 2 and 3 so this is something we can

1126
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,560
discuss

1127
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,680
and uh the fourth proposal is market

1128
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,480
domain support

1129
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,359
uh you know we already you know uh for

1130
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,319
author we can

1131
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,319
do the peer selection path selection uh

1132
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,759
mostly focus on single domain and

1133
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,520
but how do you extend to the market

1134
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,839
domain so this is something

1135
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,240
we should discuss it may require the

1136
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,359
server to server communication

1137
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,040
uh the last one is of uh operation

1138
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,680
automation and uh we already you know

1139
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,960
published

1140
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,160
author uh deployment jobs and uh

1141
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,480
uh as auto deployment jobs said actually

1142
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,839
we

1143
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:31,280
can you know uh uh gather different uh

1144
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,279
data source and uh and you know fed into

1145
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,480
the auto server and do the aggregation

1146
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,839
abstraction

1147
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,040
how to uh you know uh uh you know

1148
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,440
uh automate these uh auto server

1149
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,119
operation management

1150
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,119
automatically you know so so this is

1151
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,599
still very challenging so

1152
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,560
so we'll ask you know lewis and jason to

1153
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,160
discuss this

1154
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:57,599
and uh so we set this order and uh

1155
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:02,720
so that that's all and

1156
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,720
any objection to this order

1157
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,040
any comments

1158
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,400
uh seems no so we can move to a first

1159
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,919
presentation question by marking i

1160
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,160
believe henry's ten

1161
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:23,599
so okay um so i want to be clear so

1162
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,520
um there you have five proposals and

1163
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,720
you're not proposing that all five of

1164
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,359
them go in the charter

1165
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,959
we're supposed to select some number of

1166
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,440
yeah yeah you're right actually there's

1167
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,160
a

1168
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,280
uh i think uh we hope actually we can

1169
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,160
you know pick a

1170
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,280
two or three uh proposal from uh all

1171
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,839
these five and

1172
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,560
we can have a good start and we will not

1173
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,799
you know

1174
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,078
uh promise we'll accept all these

1175
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,319
proposals so

1176
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,119
based on our discussion our consensus

1177
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:52,079
will decide

1178
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,640
which uh which two or three can can be

1179
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,680
you know

1180
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,720
put into the charter you know okay i i

1181
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,078
did have one question

1182
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,480
you said something in cellular about

1183
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,920
3gpp and is that work

1184
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
is 3gpp asking us to do any work in this

1185
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,240
area

1186
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,520
or um is that does it just yeah going to

1187
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,439
coincide with

1188
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
go ahead yeah this is just my question

1189
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,800
so i will ask

1190
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,000
transcension and company to clarify this

1191
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,079
because i also raised

1192
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,839
the same question on the list i haven't

1193
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,119
get a response and

1194
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,359
i my feeling my expression is they uh

1195
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,319
you know defined the nef network

1196
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,960
exposure

1197
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,599
uh function architecture and

1198
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
requirements

1199
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,880
they could provide the you know

1200
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,160
foundation to provide a good data source

1201
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,599
to the other server

1202
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,560
and uh so so shenzhen can present

1203
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,280
later in his uh uh called the first half

1204
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,560
proposal

1205
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,560
and we can discuss this

1206
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,200
and thank you yeah good good

1207
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,720
clarification martin but

1208
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,240
also from my perspective um regarding

1209
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,480
selecting a few of these

1210
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,160
we could also think about prioritizing

1211
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,599
them regarding on the feedback we are

1212
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,960
having during the discussions

1213
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,400
today right so i don't think we need to

1214
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,040
date trim down

1215
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,240
to a subset of this five but if we can

1216
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,079
also say this one

1217
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,359
got better feedback or seems to be more

1218
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,400
important that's also a good

1219
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,839
progress or a good outcome um

1220
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,839
but yeah thanks for the clarification

1221
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
guys

1222
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,040
okay okay so yeah so let's move to

1223
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,839
the presentation actually we already

1224
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,800
assigned

1225
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,520
each topic to the champion uh owner and

1226
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
so

1227
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,280
transcension are you there do you want

1228
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,680
to present your

1229
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,680
topic

1230
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,400
hello can you hear me yes yes we can

1231
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,599
hear you

1232
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,119
um yeah can you make the test more

1233
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,640
lighter

1234
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,880
it's almost smaller okay okay i can read

1235
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,720
it

1236
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,920
i can read it yeah uh the main target

1237
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,160
of the song

1238
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,680
starting interrupt so i i think uh team

1239
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,879
probably won't share his slide right i

1240
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,879
believe he uploaded his lights

1241
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,799
the paragraph yeah yeah there's a newer

1242
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,800
version

1243
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,799
okay let me check his uh latest

1244
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,720
portfolio

1245
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,079
yellow slides and i think he uploads

1246
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,200
the upload is not the slider i send it

1247
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,319
to you

1248
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:31,839
to upload

1249
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,599
okay this one right we don't see your

1250
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:38,720
screen changes

1251
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,720
okay let me refresh my screen

1252
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,839
so i'm new here so sorry about that yeah

1253
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,359
yeah this is something you have to get

1254
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,200
used to in this auto working group

1255
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,240
people send slides uh uh

1256
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,560
really close to the meeting all the time

1257
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,839
yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's the

1258
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,839
ultra working group

1259
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,359
okay can you see my screen now perfect

1260
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,720
yes

1261
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:16,319
no no okay not this one this is also the

1262
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,959
uh higher this one hang on next

1263
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,960
okay okay

1264
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,480
uh yeah this one um

1265
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,680
the the proposed that

1266
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,960
we want to attention of ato to provide

1267
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,319
secular network

1268
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,440
information to the applications

1269
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:41,040
because more and more application

1270
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,960
move from the fixed ip network to the

1271
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:50,160
mobile network and a lot of

1272
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:53,359
mobile devices are used by the people

1273
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,799
and attention that have

1274
00:47:53,359 --> 00:48:00,400
used this terra saturday level

1275
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,680
information can help demonstrate that

1276
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,119
we can leverage the information from the

1277
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,279
student network

1278
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:10,000
such that from the presentations through

1279
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,319
the surrounding status between the ue

1280
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,160
uh with the base station can improve the

1281
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,440
application performance

1282
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,160
cycles by dynamically changing the bid

1283
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,280
rates

1284
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,279
to according to the uh

1285
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,240
status of the radio state radio

1286
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,040
so the work you will investigation

1287
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,399
extension

1288
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,599
or the basic auto information service

1289
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,000
to equal to the mobile clients

1290
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,040
or mobile application or mobilization in

1291
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,680
the cloud

1292
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,240
about cellular information or an english

1293
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,919
states

1294
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,040
between the unit and the

1295
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,480
station for example the information also

1296
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,319
only a throughput

1297
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,000
delay or the latency of the data

1298
00:48:54,319 --> 00:49:01,440
that is the input from the auto but

1299
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,240
the other need also need a clarification

1300
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:09,520
the general pesticide

1301
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,720
this is emotion is more cpp related so i

1302
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,599
do not

1303
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,598
explain it the attention should be

1304
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,599
created to address the dynamic

1305
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:22,160
issue because the cellular cellular

1306
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,200
lingus status like the throughput delay

1307
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,160
in a data

1308
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,879
will be changed very quickly and we

1309
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,399
needed to

1310
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,440
provide a real-time information

1311
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,920
and also we should consideration the

1312
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,160
issue

1313
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:42,319
whether this information is private

1314
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:45,759
uh or how we include a private

1315
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,960
data so we also connect security issues

1316
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,200
include the application

1317
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,480
authentication the confidence

1318
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,919
confidentiality

1319
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,680
of our ue plus the user and the level

1320
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,720
information

1321
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,078
so the the work of were firstly uh

1322
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,720
defined clearly

1323
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,599
in school empirically regarding its

1324
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:06,879
correlation

1325
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:12,400
with the cpp how to leverage

1326
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:15,680
the cv network employee function

1327
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,680
that's the propose

1328
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:31,040
so any comments martin is in the queue

1329
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,640
thanks for proposing this um the

1330
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,160
so what what exactly is the use case

1331
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,240
here that that a

1332
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,879
a handset will choose to use

1333
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,160
the the cellular network or some

1334
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,119
alternative link

1335
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,000
based on this information uh from my

1336
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,359
understanding

1337
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,079
um normally uh cellular because it's

1338
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:52,720
cellular have

1339
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,480
more and more cpu power and they have a

1340
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,000
smart enough

1341
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,760
to dynamity to detect the new status

1342
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,040
maybe it's less important for the

1343
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,079
cellular

1344
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,279
device but for the cloud gaming server

1345
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:10,319
because he's located in a cloud

1346
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:13,440
he has no information for the radio link

1347
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,880
status so he needs some

1348
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,920
some the dynamic

1349
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,440
information of the new status inside the

1350
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,400
case

1351
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,920
normally we i said that for the face and

1352
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,280
network the benefits

1353
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:33,119
and the detail on delay is some

1354
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:36,160
static not not changed very quickly

1355
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,640
but a cellular network is

1356
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,440
changing very quickly inside the case if

1357
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,040
we can provide

1358
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,720
this information to the cloud gaming

1359
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,839
server or

1360
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,160
a srvr server they can deliberately

1361
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:50,558
change the bid rate to the user in some

1362
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,598
cases no

1363
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:53,599
lagging or

1364
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:01,200
and nagging and interruption

1365
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:04,559
of the service and have a good

1366
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,078
ue quality because the ue the user are

1367
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,079
well alloyed

1368
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,079
for the uh the lagging

1369
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,400
okay um thanks that clarifies that so um

1370
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,599
i'm glad you put in language about the

1371
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:22,480
dynamicity

1372
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,000
issues because i think that is really my

1373
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,800
chief concern about this work

1374
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,319
um you guys understand ulta better than

1375
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,079
me but you know these things are not

1376
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,119
usually scaled to

1377
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,200
to be delivering real-time you know

1378
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,960
information at this this granularity um

1379
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,399
like are we confident this this is

1380
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,079
actually workable or are we just going

1381
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,599
to end up finding out that the

1382
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,440
that the frequency issues are are

1383
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,440
are um insurmountable

1384
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,078
and so maybe before we get an answer and

1385
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,640
this is janice claire

1386
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:01,760
i want a second what martin said i was

1387
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,440
also happy to see the word dynamicity

1388
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,040
in there because this is the discussions

1389
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,160
we had from the start in the alto

1390
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,279
working group

1391
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,160
and the original charter from 2008

1392
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,960
it was clear it had some phrasing in it

1393
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,200
that said

1394
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,920
things that change on the order of once

1395
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,720
per day should be conveyed via alto

1396
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,960
we are moving ahead so also the current

1397
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:26,078
performance a metrics document has

1398
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,440
metrics that change more often than once

1399
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,960
a day

1400
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:33,520
um so that's okay um

1401
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,599
but yeah in this case things may so

1402
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,559
jitter in a mobile network might change

1403
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,200
quite often

1404
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,440
but so i'm fine because the the the word

1405
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:43,200
dynamicity is explicitly in here but i

1406
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,760
guess the question for martin is a valid

1407
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,799
one

1408
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,720
um are there some metrics that don't

1409
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,480
change that often that can be conveyed

1410
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,480
from base station to mobile

1411
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,240
application right that's the question i

1412
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,400
guess well so i mean

1413
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,000
so so the word is in there and that's

1414
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,760
great and like i'd be

1415
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,480
i would you know stomp my foot if it

1416
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,920
weren't in there but at the same time i

1417
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,520
i don't want to i i would rather not

1418
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,400
bring in a research project

1419
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,839
if we're not sure this is viable um and

1420
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,520
i don't know if it's viable i'm just

1421
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,680
that i'm asking like

1422
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,400
uh have we have we have someone worked

1423
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,118
through the problem of

1424
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,680
um like does does the alto client need

1425
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,760
to ask

1426
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,680
every 100 seconds to find out if

1427
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,880
something has changed or is there a push

1428
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:33,040
system and and like how noisy is that

1429
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,000
given real cellular dynamics um

1430
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,119
right so uh martial i i don't know if i

1431
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,119
can jump and

1432
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,480
answer a little bit because i was

1433
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,240
involved a little bit

1434
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,920
and of course probably the other good

1435
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,439
person to get involved will be gangly

1436
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:48,079
from panamobo

1437
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,200
and uh there was this like a sitcom uh

1438
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,000
ni paper

1439
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,720
i called them away paper actually of a

1440
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,799
reported

1441
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,200
results and so the evaluation of the

1442
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,079
i think was a large-scale uh

1443
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,000
quote-unquote large-scale deployment of

1444
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,920
this information in the china mobile

1445
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,359
network i think in georgian province is

1446
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,200
that right and

1447
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,598
i believe they can approach to about

1448
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,359
like uh if the information changes about

1449
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,480
the collecting information about one

1450
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:19,040
minute is that right to five minutes per

1451
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,000
update and it can it could get good

1452
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,240
performance

1453
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,839
and also the overhead here also is

1454
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,118
overhead actually information is not

1455
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,640
already sent

1456
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,400
through the cellular network actually

1457
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,118
the information is collected at a base

1458
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,359
station

1459
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,280
but using backhop to directly send it to

1460
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:36,078
the servers so therefore there's no

1461
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,920
you're not consuming the uh the

1462
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:39,599
information in the

1463
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,280
cellular channel basically information

1464
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,319
collected of course information

1465
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,280
collected will be about

1466
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:46,720
the cellular network but the uh channel

1467
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,559
the giving information pushed

1468
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,839
to the server would not really go

1469
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,200
through the cellular echo would go

1470
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,319
through the back call

1471
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,839
and therefore you don't have the

1472
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,359
bandwidth constant over over there so

1473
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,720
that's why essentially called split the

1474
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:59,040
channel split architecture

1475
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,480
and there was this demo i believe very

1476
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,319
good performance but i guess governor

1477
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,960
was a guy really physically running in

1478
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:04,799
the the

1479
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,720
the demo so probably i should yield to

1480
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,119
him

1481
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,839
finish that question thank you but i'm

1482
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,880
interested to see what gang says as well

1483
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,880
yeah all right i'll sit

1484
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,000
okay that's down i also want to make

1485
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,559
some clarification i i did do some

1486
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,680
homework

1487
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:24,559
for you know 3gbp worker called nef

1488
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,200
actually

1489
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,880
they actually tried to use you know

1490
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,160
publishable model they can

1491
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,680
get gather you know uh uh celebrate

1492
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,680
information or

1493
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,879
buy network information or again very

1494
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,200
related information

1495
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,200
you know they can get the real-time

1496
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,078
information more efficiently so so we

1497
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,759
can separate

1498
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,599
you know this problem you do two issues

1499
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,240
how one is

1500
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,359
how we can get the information put put

1501
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:52,078
into the auto server

1502
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,558
the second is uh uh how frequently we

1503
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,280
can

1504
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,240
expose this information to the client so

1505
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,440
so i i think

1506
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:01,439
in 3gbp they focus on the

1507
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,520
first part of the issue they they can

1508
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,400
you know using the public

1509
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,759
mechanism they can connect real-time

1510
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,319
information or

1511
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,160
some real-time static information and

1512
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:16,000
fade it into the auto server

1513
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:18,240
so if we can you know have this uh

1514
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,200
uh you know assumption we can you know

1515
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,240
provide this

1516
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,520
information to the client you know in

1517
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,598
more efficient ways

1518
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:31,839
so i think that that's my

1519
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:34,079
my impression for this work

1520
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,040
so i i feel you know this proposal you

1521
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,520
know focus on

1522
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,040
the interface between all client and

1523
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,599
auto server they may

1524
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,680
complementary to what uh 3gb is doing

1525
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,000
and

1526
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,319
so probably so shenzhen you should

1527
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,680
answer martin's question how this works

1528
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:54,640
relate to the 3gb

1529
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,078
uh is any you know there is an exchange

1530
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,520
or is any uh

1531
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:02,880
feedback from 3gbp yeah i think

1532
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,960
that we should as i thinking

1533
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:10,160
we should as we should start

1534
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,760
navigate a nef without

1535
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,799
any reason to the cpp

1536
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,240
because for my understanding nef

1537
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:23,599
have defined a well open api to

1538
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,959
to net the ef client

1539
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,520
to subscribe uh the service

1540
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,720
they can use the subscribe notification

1541
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,440
this

1542
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,200
requested response for the subscriber

1543
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,400
notification you can defend

1544
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:42,160
one time notification and a long time

1545
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,599
and how and as a task attack spam you

1546
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,359
can notify

1547
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:50,480
the status if the anything is changed

1548
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,799
then you can look up you you can notify

1549
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,920
back

1550
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:56,559
not need a poor again game

1551
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,200
so they can notify oh what can you can

1552
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,480
define

1553
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,480
how long uh how their frequency

1554
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,680
you are notified for example you can

1555
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,640
notify 10

1556
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,520
milliseconds uh even there's no changes

1557
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,279
you can overlap back

1558
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,119
i think these have different this

1559
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,920
couldn't become them but i think

1560
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,920
my main challenge is that

1561
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:27,359
does not provide very frequency change

1562
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:30,160
the parameters because they also know

1563
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:34,000
it's a parameter or valuable consumes

1564
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:36,720
a lot of uh resource

1565
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,640
because they tended to frequently very

1566
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,959
consume a lot of resource

1567
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,839
also they cannot provide very sensitive

1568
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,559
information

1569
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:46,558
because you cannot ask please open

1570
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:52,640
you can or ask one person

1571
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,040
as order information for example you can

1572
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:58,160
ask his personal location

1573
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,599
but only this request

1574
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,040
is allowed for example you have a

1575
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:10,000
something sla with the operator then

1576
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:10,000
can output this information to the

1577
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,839
requester

1578
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:23,759
okay i i think

1579
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:29,839
yeah okay okay go ahead go ahead

1580
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,839
and that was just that i'm sorry

1581
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:46,240
sorry yeah i'm running ahead

1582
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,919
okay yeah so my other question was so i

1583
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,399
mean like when you if if you're talking

1584
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,440
about

1585
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:54,240
you know feed gaming fee or any sort of

1586
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,359
feedback for an active base adaptive bit

1587
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,959
rate like

1588
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:58,319
i mean you know the obvious solutions to

1589
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,280
this that don't involve lots of

1590
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,200
intermediaries

1591
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,880
like uh uh you know looking at

1592
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,879
connection control signals looking at

1593
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,480
direct user feedback from from the from

1594
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,440
the from the gaming client

1595
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,200
et cetera like um could someone sort of

1596
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,400
explain intuitively why this

1597
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,799
is uh like

1598
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:25,839
why this would have better dynamics than

1599
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:25,839
something more straightforward

1600
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,119
so clever mark you're asking a question

1601
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,079
to god or asking to try to change it uh

1602
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,799
oh i i i i'm anyone who thinks they can

1603
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:43,200
answer the question i don't know

1604
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:45,599
okay because i i do have something

1605
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:47,279
i just uh i want to say something about

1606
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:51,359
the time granularity right

1607
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:55,039
so i i think it's really depends on the

1608
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:57,440
the demands from from the application

1609
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,319
right if they for example if uh for the

1610
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,280
cloud

1611
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:03,359
i mean server even the cloud game server

1612
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,760
want to change it to read for

1613
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,200
uh for seconds right might be second

1614
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,720
level information

1615
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:14,319
might be very very useful i think from

1616
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:17,520
our experiment uh in our live network

1617
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:20,079
we think the sixth level or

1618
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,680
even the 100 milliseconds level senior

1619
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,720
information

1620
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,759
are quite useful for the application

1621
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:30,399
to to adapt to their logic right to

1622
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:33,520
improve the quality of the experience

1623
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:36,559
so i think as a 100

1624
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,759
minutes level worth second level kind of

1625
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,359
um

1626
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:45,280
uh fluctuation i think it's

1627
01:02:41,359 --> 01:02:49,119
it's not quite uh to

1628
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,440
to refine compare with a is a

1629
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:54,240
they they this singular interaction

1630
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:57,520
between the three digit network i think

1631
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,160
it is facebook to us uh for the

1632
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,079
auto server to obtain those kind of

1633
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,558
information and distribute those kind of

1634
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,319
images

1635
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:09,599
they auto client so i think it's uh

1636
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:09,599
it's donable right for us

1637
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,079
the question is why would you not just

1638
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,960
use

1639
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,319
something like direct client feedback or

1640
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,839
um

1641
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:23,839
you know existing regression signals in

1642
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:26,720
the network to to do your apr tuning

1643
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:28,000
yes that's a good question yeah can i

1644
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,160
try to answer this one so

1645
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,240
very share my opinion a little bit okay

1646
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,480
maybe i'm jumping in the cube oh maybe

1647
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:35,839
maybe lyle i think lyle gonna answer

1648
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,640
kevin you guys are gonna look here but i

1649
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,920
i do have some

1650
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:41,118
[Music]

1651
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,760
yeah i i can i can answer that um so

1652
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,440
i i think maybe you would you know we

1653
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,599
when we think about 3gpp we also

1654
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,760
probably want to keep in mind um

1655
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:55,760
a gsma effort on uh operator platform

1656
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,839
uh called opg um and so there

1657
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:59,119
in that work we've been looking at two

1658
01:03:57,839 --> 01:04:01,279
things that are related

1659
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:03,039
really and i think can help answer the

1660
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,640
question here

1661
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:06,319
and that is regardless of how the

1662
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,558
information is acquired

1663
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:10,480
the gaming server on the edge side or on

1664
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,480
the cloud side

1665
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,079
would like at-large information we don't

1666
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,799
need in-band

1667
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:18,559
specific user feedback but the gaming

1668
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:22,000
servers tend to require

1669
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:25,119
for example kind of a general uh

1670
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,400
information on the average cqi really

1671
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,000
the average shirt but the average

1672
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,920
latency

1673
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
that a device happens to be connected to

1674
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,200
because you know the connection has been

1675
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,640
established yet

1676
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,359
between the client the server in this

1677
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,799
case and so we're really looking for

1678
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:40,319
kind of that coarse grain

1679
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,079
type of information that we would expect

1680
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:45,119
from an alternate server

1681
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:47,039
and then based upon that

1682
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,599
before the game started right it's

1683
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,359
really that matchmaking design

1684
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,760
where it may look at multiple mobile

1685
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,520
clients and then make kind of an

1686
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,039
intelligent decision about the best

1687
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,520
location where there's

1688
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:01,200
multiple options or in many cases

1689
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,319
multiple bad options

1690
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:06,399
on where to actually host the game um

1691
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,680
in terms of the network placement so so

1692
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,680
that's one so

1693
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,440
we have to remember that you know this

1694
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,960
data really

1695
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,119
isn't known between the client and

1696
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,880
server right at the beginning and and so

1697
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,319
we're really needing kind of just some

1698
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,960
generalization

1699
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:23,200
based upon the location the other thing

1700
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,839
i i want to keep in mind is in 5g

1701
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,879
there's a couple of huge changes so one

1702
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:30,078
is

1703
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,640
that fixed wireless is now

1704
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,680
you know a primary product so when we

1705
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:37,200
say mobile

1706
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:40,000
nowadays that we probably should

1707
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,399
really not use that term it's it's kind

1708
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,480
of a

1709
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,640
kind of an old view the other thing is

1710
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,920
in release 16 and it's some new

1711
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,558
documents

1712
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,119
wireline convergence is now a part of

1713
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:54,240
the the integration of the network

1714
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,240
and so um you can directly

1715
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,759
add what they call alternative or other

1716
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:01,038
access networks

1717
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:04,079
such as g-pawn or or docsis networks

1718
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:06,400
directly into the 5g cores um

1719
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,640
so you know we'll have to all kind of

1720
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,000
start shifting our thinking in terms of

1721
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:12,160
you know when we say a mobile network

1722
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,839
when we say a mobile core what that is

1723
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,680
from from the point of view of the

1724
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:17,680
application servers it makes no

1725
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,399
difference right as to what it's looking

1726
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,399
so

1727
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,319
um i i think the granularity is not as

1728
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,760
big of a concern in fact i think 100

1729
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,799
milliseconds this are things maybe

1730
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,319
overkill

1731
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:28,480
at least from what we've seen in the ops

1732
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:30,640
the gsma obg group

1733
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,400
in terms of their needs and and you know

1734
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,759
i i think um

1735
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,200
really you know what they're looking at

1736
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,799
the beginning really isn't any of that

1737
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,558
in-band work

1738
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:40,000
so i hope that that helps maybe answer

1739
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:43,280
some of the questions

1740
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,839
oh that helps a lot thank you very much

1741
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,440
all right so like i really want to add

1742
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:49,680
some one thing very quickly

1743
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,480
and martin asked your question why not

1744
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,558
directly

1745
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,079
uh uh client feedback i think just one

1746
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,480
thing i think that's what i heard from

1747
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,400
you

1748
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,920
from tencent people and the kind of

1749
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,559
mobile we oftentimes the business

1750
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,440
relationship

1751
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:03,200
is between the network and the server so

1752
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,119
therefore information basically really

1753
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:06,558
is flowing between for example attention

1754
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,400
it's paying for the services

1755
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,240
and they want sales channel standards

1756
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,359
themselves they decide to pay or not

1757
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,479
you really don't have to go through a

1758
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,839
client because they don't even know

1759
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,599
that's basically somehow there's

1760
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:17,359
negotiation between the network and the

1761
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,280
application provider directly

1762
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:20,558
so for example that's one more i don't

1763
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,880
know that's a slightly

1764
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,240
uh uh just they're compiled a reason to

1765
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,039
talk about why not directed client

1766
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,919
feedback

1767
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,839
i think that's one question you're

1768
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,839
asking as well right

1769
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,319
yes thank you

1770
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,960
okay guys i think we should move on to

1771
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,599
the next yeah

1772
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,440
and we are already way into the session

1773
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,559
and as i mentioned before

1774
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,079
um 20 minutes before the end i will um

1775
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,720
i would like to start the wrap up so i

1776
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:54,160
think we should move on to the next um

1777
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,598
yeah charter okay so sorry can i ask a

1778
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,078
quick question how much

1779
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,520
notes should i take about all these uh

1780
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,559
disco they're not really working group

1781
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,640
action items and

1782
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,760
should i catch try to catch all these

1783
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,520
questions uh

1784
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,799
yeah that's that's a good question

1785
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,119
that's a good question richard

1786
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:10,720
i i guess you should summarize the

1787
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,319
discussion if you can

1788
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,319
and i mean this meeting is being

1789
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:15,520
recorded so i think if somebody really

1790
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:17,519
wants to follow the

1791
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,359
technical discussion we just said the

1792
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,480
recording is the best way to do that

1793
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:23,199
right

1794
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:24,318
um i guess for the notes you can just

1795
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,839
you know summarize

1796
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,839
that there has been some technical

1797
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,519
discussion and and and some questions

1798
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:30,880
have been raised um

1799
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,279
why this is needed and what the

1800
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,600
advantages are okay but you don't need

1801
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,600
to

1802
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,839
to write all of them down in the notes

1803
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,839
right yeah

1804
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,158
shortly okay great but i think this was

1805
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,759
good discussion this is exactly what we

1806
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,198
want to have that we have some

1807
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:50,880
you know discussion about the pros and

1808
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,080
cons and why we would need such

1809
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:58,960
such an extension um so yeah

1810
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,960
um next java item sabine

1811
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:04,960
sabine are you there yeah you see my

1812
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:08,000
screen

1813
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:11,439
hello i do okay

1814
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,799
go ahead uh so shall we start with the

1815
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:19,040
proposed paragraph i'm trying to uh

1816
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:22,080
read your slides directly um

1817
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:25,679
so um so what we propose uh

1818
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:29,759
um is uh protocol extensions

1819
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:32,799
uh that uh convey a richer set

1820
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:36,080
and a richer and extensible set of

1821
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,719
additional attributes on auto

1822
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,839
information

1823
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:45,040
that allows client to make more informed

1824
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:48,158
decisions that would be beyond

1825
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,000
simply the where and the when as it is

1826
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:53,439
now

1827
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:59,040
so these additional attributes

1828
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:59,040
will be related to both path cost

1829
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,679
for example we would have path cost

1830
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:07,759
values with attributes

1831
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:10,960
such as real-time network indications or

1832
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,840
policy attributes which

1833
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,960
basically would be qualitative

1834
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,239
attributes and

1835
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:23,920
these additional attributes would also

1836
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,879
be applied associated to entities

1837
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,679
for example entity properties with

1838
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:31,760
attributes

1839
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:35,199
reflecting time dependency so basically

1840
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,320
uh the idea would be to uh uh

1841
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:41,440
to to to go along uh the the

1842
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:46,000
the path costs and also

1843
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:49,599
uh with the qualitative attributes and

1844
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:53,600
add time

1845
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:57,440
extend properties to time dependent

1846
01:10:53,600 --> 01:11:00,960
properties more or less

1847
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:04,000
mimicking alto cost calendar

1848
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:07,199
so we would have uh

1849
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,199
property calendars

1850
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,320
and then the working group of course

1851
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:16,159
will specify these are like

1852
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:17,920
uh gener general uh so-called general

1853
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:21,040
extensions because

1854
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,600
we feel that this is useful to not

1855
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,719
uh for the sake of having an extensions

1856
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,960
but this will

1857
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:28,800
be useful for anybody in the working

1858
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,320
group

1859
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:34,719
uh that can be uh that will

1860
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,080
have use cases uh involving such

1861
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,560
features

1862
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,880
and so this is why we will specify such

1863
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,880
extensions in coordination

1864
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:48,320
with both autoworking groups group items

1865
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:51,520
sorry and also

1866
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:52,719
other ietf working groups that have a

1867
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:56,080
focus

1868
01:11:52,719 --> 01:12:00,080
on the related use cases

1869
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:01,120
and the scope of this extension is not

1870
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:04,960
limited

1871
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:07,120
to those uh identified

1872
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,239
by the working group items and then

1873
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,760
working groups

1874
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:12,879
but also limited by the criteria set out

1875
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,719
below

1876
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:20,239
which are the ones uh the the usual um

1877
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,560
questions that are uh to be addressed

1878
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:25,280
within the working group in terms of is

1879
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,280
it doable

1880
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,919
do we know whether we will have such

1881
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:37,839
indications

1882
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:37,840
and questions such as these ones

1883
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:42,480
so in the next in the following slides

1884
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,960
if you like

1885
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:49,040
uh the following slides uh

1886
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,640
proposal use cases that we are

1887
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,760
motivating these

1888
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,640
proposals and but over which i can go up

1889
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,640
on your questions

1890
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,080
okay and let's focus on the proposal

1891
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:06,320
charter

1892
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:09,199
work item text so any comments on this

1893
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,199
proposed text

1894
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,920
so i have a question um sabine this is

1895
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,000
very

1896
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,040
i mean this at first it reads like the

1897
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,640
old charter text

1898
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,360
where we have now the cross canada or

1899
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,640
rfc so is the main difference that you

1900
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,320
now also want to address

1901
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,320
paths like in path vector

1902
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:35,440
yes indeed i uh this is uh

1903
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:38,639
done uh on purpose because

1904
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:41,759
the the idea of um of

1905
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:44,560
resu reusing as much as possible

1906
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,960
the text of the current charter was to

1907
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,080
uh

1908
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:51,840
to say that there are uh

1909
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:55,199
further optimizations that are needed uh

1910
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:59,280
uh on these protocols so it's it's a con

1911
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:02,159
it's a continuation of the

1912
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,920
previous optimizations that were that

1913
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:07,040
brought us for example

1914
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,840
the calendar so decision on when to

1915
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,120
connect

1916
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:14,159
that extended uh the end points to

1917
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:17,360
properties that were allowing

1918
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:20,159
to define uh entity uh sorry that we're

1919
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:22,639
extending endpoints to entities

1920
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:23,679
in particular ines that allow too

1921
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,120
detailed

1922
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:29,040
uh particular parts of a path but not

1923
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,239
only

1924
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:35,679
and uh so and and

1925
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:39,599
that also brought to path vector so so

1926
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:42,719
there is we uh there are use cases that

1927
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:46,320
where it was clear that uh

1928
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:48,800
some additional uh

1929
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:50,080
some additional some additional details

1930
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,760
on the cost value

1931
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:57,120
uh could be necessary or useful

1932
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,159
and by the way i would like to comment

1933
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:01,280
on the feedback

1934
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:04,559
uh received by

1935
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:08,159
luis and so just to say that this

1936
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:11,840
proposal does not mean to be restrictive

1937
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:12,320
and i agree it should be a placeholder

1938
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:17,360
for

1939
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:19,280
other uh protocol optimizations

1940
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:22,000
that we might find necessary in

1941
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,000
particular

1942
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:26,719
upon uh making the examples in this

1943
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,440
slide set i run

1944
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,159
again into that issue of the cross

1945
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,199
product

1946
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:36,320
product uh when you do so

1947
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:38,799
it seems simple uh technically

1948
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,840
but it is necessary because for example

1949
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,679
if you

1950
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:46,800
uh request a require sorry

1951
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,960
a cost map so you have first a set of

1952
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,199
sources and then a set of destination

1953
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,640
i mean that has been discussed and

1954
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,678
brought by uh

1955
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:59,120
by richard uh uh years ago

1956
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,360
and uh so we and then we we only ca

1957
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,559
the current protocol with the current

1958
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,920
protocol

1959
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:07,120
so we just get the the data on the cross

1960
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:09,440
products of

1961
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:11,519
source and destination and given the

1962
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,080
recent publications by

1963
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,040
ingmar for example on the deployment the

1964
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,000
network map

1965
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,560
and and we saw it when we when when we

1966
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,440
measure

1967
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,000
the what is circulating on the network

1968
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,239
and

1969
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,280
when we measure the volume of a network

1970
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:28,879
it gets

1971
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:32,080
huge very very very quickly so

1972
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:35,199
whatever we can do to uh

1973
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:38,960
to diminish uh

1974
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,839
the the volume of exchange data

1975
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,840
is a good thing

1976
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,360
yeah i i think a key use case for for

1977
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,880
this proposed

1978
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:57,120
academy is for path vector you know

1979
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:58,960
you we actually you know you may have a

1980
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,719
multiple pass you you want to select the

1981
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,560
best pass and

1982
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:08,239
the limitation for existing past vectors

1983
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:11,360
it may it may doesn't describe

1984
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:13,839
some past concentrate you know

1985
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,639
as you uh mentioned about you know

1986
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,880
access type

1987
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,679
you know from which kind of x type you

1988
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,480
can

1989
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,880
uh you can select the the connection

1990
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:24,159
paths

1991
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,560
you know or you may select a end-to-end

1992
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,639
path

1993
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:28,239
with some network performance

1994
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:31,760
requirements so

1995
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:32,239
this uh proposal seems to me actually is

1996
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,840
the

1997
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:38,000
you know additional pieces that we can

1998
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,000
add for the past vector

1999
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:45,280
yeah thanks and and also uh

2000
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,879
if we go back uh if we uh think about

2001
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,599
the first proposal on sale

2002
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,239
actually that was a a major use case

2003
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,679
that

2004
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:58,239
really motivated this proposal because

2005
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:58,960
uh the the the use case was a a cellular

2006
01:17:58,239 --> 01:18:01,280
network

2007
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,560
i presented i think this use case a

2008
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,280
couple of years ago

2009
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,360
when it when we when it really appeared

2010
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,320
when we ran into it

2011
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:10,320
um so

2012
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,080
there was the use case was an

2013
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:18,080
application on a

2014
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:20,080
on a mobile phone that was using an alto

2015
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,840
client and of at that time

2016
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,840
so we we felt that uh

2017
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:29,520
we could uh for example for each video

2018
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,640
chunk

2019
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,320
we could get auto information uh for

2020
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,360
this video chunk

2021
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,559
uh every two seconds but i mean we did

2022
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,960
not

2023
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:43,199
need that frequency but uh we could

2024
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,880
achieve up to this frequency

2025
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,919
but anyway uh the alto information is

2026
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:54,640
uh by essence meant to be

2027
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:56,560
like maybe a 30-second 20 seconds just

2028
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,080
for the sake of avoiding network

2029
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:01,280
instability

2030
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:03,199
but still it's quite long compared to

2031
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:05,360
the pace of

2032
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:07,599
network information that a cellular

2033
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:11,759
network can generate

2034
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:14,719
and a ceiling network can generate

2035
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,280
real-time indicator and for this case it

2036
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:20,800
was a

2037
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:23,440
an indicator saying from 3gbp release 13

2038
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,640
that was telling you whether uh

2039
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:29,919
unattended data is allowed or not

2040
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:32,239
and it was like a uh boolean uh so

2041
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:33,600
well if it's not a load it means the

2042
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:35,839
connection is poor it's a

2043
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,280
if it's a load it's me it means the

2044
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,800
connection is

2045
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,080
uh is fine so of course the alto server

2046
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,159
cannot

2047
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:49,280
extend this dynamicity this high

2048
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:52,960
real-time dynamicity but still

2049
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:56,320
if we have the the path cost given by

2050
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:59,760
alto which is like uh smooth like uh

2051
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:03,040
aggregated over time and space uh

2052
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:06,480
and this path cost

2053
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:08,560
can be affected by this indicator that

2054
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:11,040
it's provided real time

2055
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:13,280
so this can provide you in a sense a

2056
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:17,120
detail on the path cost

2057
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:20,480
because okay you have the the long term

2058
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:24,639
alto information like 30 seconds

2059
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:27,199
which is long term for cellular network

2060
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:28,719
and then you can always if the ultra

2061
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:32,080
server says okay

2062
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:35,679
that's the cost but if whatever

2063
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:38,080
depending on the value of this indicator

2064
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:38,960
well this path cost which would be

2065
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,519
normally

2066
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,800
four well if it's not a load let's say

2067
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,440
it will be three

2068
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,719
uh so far if sorry the cost will be

2069
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,320
higher five

2070
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:53,760
and if it's a load okay it can be

2071
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:57,040
say three so this is actually

2072
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,639
a way to combine the long-term

2073
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,560
information like uh

2074
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:06,480
20 or 30 seconds by the auto server

2075
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:09,760
with some real time indicator that is

2076
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:13,280
that you get outside uh

2077
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:16,400
the alto channel we via a normal

2078
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:18,719
network channel so saving we

2079
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,679
literally run out of time so maybe we oh

2080
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,800
sorry sorry so

2081
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:25,520
so i i stopped talking yes okay

2082
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:27,520
can i get comments i mean like you okay

2083
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,000
okay yeah go ahead

2084
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,800
okay so i i do want to make one one

2085
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,800
comment

2086
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:36,400
about this particular uh extension so

2087
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,880
here's one use case which i'm always

2088
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:41,040
thinking and i think that's also

2089
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,120
my comment we related with i believe

2090
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,800
martin asked two questions right

2091
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:46,320
two questions all right two following

2092
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,719
one is leprom

2093
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:50,080
and of course typically uh uh what's the

2094
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:51,679
problem and what's the usual kind of

2095
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,159
result typically use case

2096
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,000
and number two is feasibility right so

2097
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:58,559
we will have solution architecture

2098
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,600
and coming a richer extensible set of

2099
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,760
attributes and so on

2100
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,800
so i think my comment would be related

2101
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,760
with both

2102
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,639
so uh what's the issue here i think the

2103
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,040
problem the way

2104
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:10,000
i look at what subbing is proposing here

2105
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,080
is actually quite

2106
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,280
similar to an architecture because we

2107
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,559
want to talk about architecture

2108
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,960
visibility

2109
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,880
is architecture of like say for example

2110
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,679
premier uh

2111
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,120
prometheus right p-r-o-m-e-t-h-u-s which

2112
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,840
is very very popular

2113
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:27,599
uh data management premium i think a lot

2114
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,520
of networks a lot of enterprise network

2115
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,239
using this framework to collect data

2116
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:35,280
process data query data and so on

2117
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:37,360
and so basically for that data model

2118
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,320
what you do is you have a metric and

2119
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,519
then you have an

2120
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:42,960
unlimited uh key value store it's

2121
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,440
important called attributes and then of

2122
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,760
course

2123
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,360
you you apply the data i think that's a

2124
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,360
very nice architecture can really

2125
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:52,799
address a lot of use cases

2126
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,480
and for example one use case or issue

2127
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,320
maybe even kill it from one right out

2128
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,120
over basically for example very simple

2129
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:59,679
one is

2130
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:01,519
you ask what's the perform okay you ask

2131
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,920
what's the latency

2132
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,840
uh for this particular flow and

2133
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,800
eventually if anyone follows let's say

2134
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,560
ippm

2135
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,480
for all the product eventually gets very

2136
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:12,639
ugly and and

2137
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,080
you you you become endless of

2138
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,239
specification of

2139
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,120
standards and so therefore that's very

2140
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:19,599
very

2141
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:21,280
difficult because the latency could be

2142
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:24,719
which one which follow http

2143
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:28,080
http 2 and repeat three and a quick

2144
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,360
and uh and what kind of traffic and all

2145
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,960
these can attributes will

2146
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,960
go in eventually to really understand

2147
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,760
what performance metric potential

2148
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,280
can be server become very messy system

2149
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,040
and promise to solve the problem that

2150
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,000
basically said okay here's a metric here

2151
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,760
let me indicate

2152
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,600
a central and open flat flexible a key

2153
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:46,719
value store and you can query and so on

2154
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,800
so therefore

2155
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:49,920
if we do this richer and extensible set

2156
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,320
of attributes

2157
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,920
and we immediately would be able to

2158
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:56,080
introduce promiscuous

2159
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,600
capabilities into auto framework and

2160
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,559
therefore we have a very powerful

2161
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:02,400
very reachable uh extensible framework

2162
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,840
to solve a lot of issues and also

2163
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:06,320
framework is already over there which

2164
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,880
you can just borrow i think that's

2165
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,159
my comment why i buy this i i spend so

2166
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:12,590
much time with something in the last

2167
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:15,440
couple of days

2168
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:17,920
[Applause]

2169
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:19,599
okay they're good comments so maybe uh

2170
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:22,159
saving you can take a look at that

2171
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,639
and see whether you can get a useful

2172
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:26,000
input

2173
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:28,560
from there so okay

2174
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,280
so let's move to the next and new

2175
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:45,840
transport and enemy

2176
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:45,840
stops here

2177
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,559
actually i think the paragraph is not

2178
01:24:54,480 --> 01:25:01,280
included in the

2179
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,280
slides spot in the google doc so maybe

2180
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:13,840
oh okay let me switch to the

2181
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:27,840
okay go ahead

2182
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:34,799
yep i think that's the one uh so i think

2183
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:36,239
for this which item uh the motivation is

2184
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,320
relatively simple and

2185
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:42,559
i think uh it

2186
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,480
based on the fact that we might be

2187
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:48,080
providing similar information to

2188
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:51,519
clients so we might uh have um

2189
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:54,639
more uh requirements on the performance

2190
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:58,239
of the auto service itself so

2191
01:25:54,639 --> 01:26:01,760
and and as hp and also

2192
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:05,599
so http 2 is already an rfc and

2193
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:08,800
uh http 3 is being developed

2194
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,440
as an rc but but it's still in the

2195
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,199
progress

2196
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:12,480
and i think they provide some features

2197
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:15,280
that can improve the performance

2198
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,159
of but first they have some benefits

2199
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:21,599
over hp 1.x which is used by

2200
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:24,000
auto and second they can help eliminate

2201
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,840
the some workarounds that we use in the

2202
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,239
current extension such as pass vector

2203
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,960
and

2204
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:31,120
not equipment updates and then might

2205
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,159
help simplify the

2206
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,800
protocol itself and then the purpose of

2207
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,599
this

2208
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:39,600
item is to provide an alternative way to

2209
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,719
transport the auto information

2210
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:46,320
on top of http 2 and above

2211
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:49,520
and uh yeah basically that that's it

2212
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:52,719
and we see we need to specify

2213
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,440
uh how the servers and clients should

2214
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,480
exchange

2215
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,839
information and uh

2216
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,559
especially for past factory and

2217
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,560
equipment updates and then

2218
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,159
we might also introduce an extension to

2219
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:07,600
the ird to specif

2220
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:09,759
allow clients and servers to kind of

2221
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:14,560
negotiate how they want to

2222
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,560
transport the auto information

2223
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:20,320
so thanks guys so i i have a quick

2224
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:22,879
question you know for

2225
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,000
uh passive vector you know it you know

2226
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,800
uh

2227
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,920
actually use multi-part to return uh

2228
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:30,719
multiple responses

2229
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:31,600
so my multi-part message uh also is

2230
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,120
obviously

2231
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,719
actually widely used and it can be used

2232
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,400
you know uh you know build on top of

2233
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,960
this http one but uh

2234
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:41,759
can we use these uh you know multipart

2235
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:44,800
messages in

2236
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,360
hdb too also it applied to to you know

2237
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,480
for

2238
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:52,080
uh cdni

2239
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,320
uh you know uh draft actually the

2240
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,840
actually the reference sse you know sse

2241
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:58,400
is also widely used

2242
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,120
why so since your proposal you want to

2243
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:02,719
obsolete

2244
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:05,920
sse or multiply the message

2245
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:08,560
what do you think about that uh

2246
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,080
yeah yeah for that part maybe i actually

2247
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:14,000
include a figure in the slides

2248
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:16,480
so uh but let me try to describe them

2249
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,760
uh here and i think one of the reasons

2250
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,879
we want you

2251
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,440
uh yes first answer the question

2252
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,639
first yes if possible so first answer

2253
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:27,599
the question

2254
01:28:24,639 --> 01:28:29,440
we can still use the current uh for

2255
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:33,199
example multiplier and sse

2256
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:36,400
in even on top of http 2 but that would

2257
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:37,280
uh basically not fully leverage the

2258
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,320
benefits

2259
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:41,120
of http 2 especially for the ssc part so

2260
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,679
the sse

2261
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:44,800
kind of uh multiplexes multiple

2262
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,840
resources

2263
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:50,880
into a single data stream and

2264
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,040
uh so from the

2265
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,239
service point of view from the from the

2266
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,679
communication point of view it's a

2267
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,759
single resource

2268
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,920
and for the single if you deliver a

2269
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:02,719
single resource over h32

2270
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:04,159
it will uh basically will be considered

2271
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:08,239
considered as a single stream

2272
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:11,920
and if you if you want if you split the

2273
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:14,080
resources and treat every increment up

2274
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:16,480
for through every increment update for a

2275
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,480
single resource as a single stream then

2276
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,599
there can be multiple streams uh

2277
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:22,839
delivering us

2278
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:26,000
data and i think that could be more

2279
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:28,000
uh i i think

2280
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,679
that basically will give us some uh

2281
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,520
performance improvement

2282
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:33,360
and also i think one of the reasons we

2283
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:36,480
want to introduce this

2284
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:39,599
new uh transfer mechanism is

2285
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:43,120
a kind of uh avoids the

2286
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:46,400
need of like third-party libraries which

2287
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:48,559
support like martial and ssc

2288
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,559
yep

2289
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:55,280
okay so so follow up a question you know

2290
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:56,080
for encoding you know so http they're

2291
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,159
using

2292
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,920
uh binary encoding for you know header

2293
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:03,360
format and uh

2294
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,360
data format uh for me actually so

2295
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,480
how how do you see you know this is

2296
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,559
actually you know for uh

2297
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,559
ultra baseball protocol you know they

2298
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,480
use a json you know so you you need to

2299
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:15,600
do the translation

2300
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:17,360
so now actually actually i think

2301
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,520
we're now going to introduce a new

2302
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,480
binary format of auto messages we just

2303
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,560
basically

2304
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:27,440
uh like put the

2305
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,159
clear json text or the encrypted json

2306
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,040
text as

2307
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:32,719
a binary and then the server or client

2308
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:34,560
could for example

2309
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,000
read the data directly from the binary

2310
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:39,040
object actually i

2311
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
uh if you go to the next slide and yep

2312
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:44,000
it's like

2313
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:48,400
so on the left hand side is actually the

2314
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,719
uh json json uh basically it's a message

2315
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,120
for

2316
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:53,120
the multiple message for m pass vector

2317
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,599
example and on the right hand side

2318
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:57,040
uh actually it's not the same co i just

2319
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,480
basically

2320
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:03,199
i used a python library to

2321
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,559
put these two messages into a single

2322
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:08,159
http request and

2323
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,159
uh here's what the

2324
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,519
data transfer from the server to the

2325
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,239
client will look like first

2326
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,520
there will exchange some settings frames

2327
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,678
and then the server

2328
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,719
the server will send a push promise

2329
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:20,639
frame to the

2330
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,320
client notifying that one of the

2331
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,480
resources delivered

2332
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,400
is going to be uh delivered to the

2333
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,360
client through stream id 2

2334
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,638
and then it returns the pass the course

2335
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:34,000
map part

2336
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:37,920
of course the data here uh i i

2337
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:41,199
mainly extract the

2338
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,480
json information from the binary format

2339
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:45,678
but actually

2340
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:48,400
when i was developing the library uh the

2341
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:50,080
the banner the the binary basically

2342
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,960
contains the

2343
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:54,320
uh the same json text so i think this

2344
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:59,840
wouldn't be a problem

2345
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:59,840
basically the the formatting of uh http2

2346
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:05,120
okay yeah thanks for clarification i

2347
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:08,879
think we still

2348
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:13,360
require some http expert to verify this

2349
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:17,520
yeah of course

2350
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,519
any other comments from the floor

2351
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,560
and actually i think we should move on

2352
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:26,400
okay because

2353
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:28,080
i would like to start the wrap up and

2354
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:31,519
maybe in yeah

2355
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:34,080
10 minutes so maybe

2356
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,199
so for each remaining proposal for five

2357
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,679
minutes

2358
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:42,559
correct that's a good idea yes okay

2359
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:42,560
so richard

2360
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:55,840
it's your turn let me share

2361
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,480
richard

2362
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,840
can you guys see my screen

2363
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:29,440
yes i can see it okay

2364
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:35,920
who's going to present richard i yeah

2365
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:36,800
richard yeah yeah richard are you there

2366
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:39,760
guys

2367
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,159
can you hear me yes yes all right oh

2368
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,639
okay

2369
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,679
sure yo you got five minutes we need to

2370
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:46,159
wrap yeah

2371
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,960
so i already i have four minutes left

2372
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:50,080
okay so

2373
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,400
basically and basically i'm trying to

2374
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,480
say

2375
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:53,599
is a multi-domain actually was designed

2376
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,000
to be very beginning

2377
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,239
and uh also should support multi-domain

2378
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,480
that's specified in rc 79

2379
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:04,638
7971 and uh uh chin i think

2380
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,879
quarterly center which is great but what

2381
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:07,840
i want to argue is that the current auto

2382
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,920
services

2383
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,280
uh actually don't really handle

2384
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,040
multi-domain very well

2385
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:17,920
and there are quite a lot of document

2386
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:18,639
talk about the issues next slides please

2387
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,800
next place

2388
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:22,719
yeah so this is a slice of actually

2389
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,280
illustrator issues uh multi-domain and

2390
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,600
this is

2391
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:27,519
a slide icon made by sebastian i don't

2392
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:28,639
believe he joined today that's early and

2393
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,800
so all this kind of conflict

2394
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:32,400
timing and so on so basically here is

2395
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:35,120
the current auto would work

2396
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:36,719
uh we have here x here on left hand side

2397
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:41,360
uh we have bunch of

2398
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:43,280
resources at the pier 1a 1b 2a2b 3a3b

2399
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:44,960
and current essential auto particle is

2400
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:47,199
only fully specified

2401
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,480
when the prx can query the auto server

2402
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:50,400
or first hop essentially

2403
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:51,599
one hops and then wouldn't be able to

2404
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:54,159
get information about

2405
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,679
uh uh i speed for example here suppose

2406
01:34:54,159 --> 01:35:00,159
look at a simple case

2407
01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:01,199
where the uh the auto server isp1 would

2408
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:04,000
be neutral about

2409
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:05,440
pier 2a and pier 2b and there's no way

2410
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:08,239
to really get losing information

2411
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:10,239
it's not specified at all so therefore i

2412
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:11,040
could perform here maybe sp2 would

2413
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,799
prefer 2b

2414
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:14,320
or 2a but there's no way to know about

2415
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,960
that so therefore basically

2416
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:18,799
the protocol is relatively neutral and

2417
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:22,560
specific for only a single

2418
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:22,560
uh domain second exercise please

2419
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,480
okay and so i got this transformed to be

2420
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,679
a major problem because to answer the

2421
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,040
relevant question would people be

2422
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,159
interested yes of course

2423
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:36,320
and um left hand side here is a paper

2424
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:37,599
the slides by steering the hyper giants

2425
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,759
traffic at scale

2426
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:42,000
um i think i believe one called next

2427
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,840
best paper also the irtf

2428
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,360
apply networking price and one of the

2429
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,119
major issues we need to figure out and

2430
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:48,960
we have a lot of discussions with engema

2431
01:35:47,119 --> 01:35:51,360
and sparcia and so on is

2432
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:53,119
you want solid issue of federated fellow

2433
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,839
director which is actually based on auto

2434
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:55,280
and so on

2435
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,320
and essentially is multi-speed

2436
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:57,599
collaboration how do you really have

2437
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:00,880
multiple outdoor servers

2438
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:02,719
the right-hand side is lc uh opn which

2439
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,679
call network you can see that it has a

2440
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:05,119
lot of networks

2441
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,800
and therefore you also have a lot of

2442
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,759
auto servers how to handle the issue the

2443
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,760
auto really does not

2444
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:12,880
really have given a full specification

2445
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,880
oh okay next slides please

2446
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,519
okay and what i want to say would be

2447
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:19,280
their uh

2448
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,360
discussion during the meetings was would

2449
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,639
release really become a research problem

2450
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,320
or not actually it's not

2451
01:36:22,639 --> 01:36:26,480
and just like like maybe like three

2452
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,840
weeks ago and during a weekly meeting we

2453
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,678
did introduce a concept called

2454
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,040
automotive domain abstractions

2455
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,199
we did introduce quite a few very

2456
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,880
interesting uh abstractions and so on so

2457
01:36:33,199 --> 01:36:35,839
therefore feasibility and architecture

2458
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,679
seems to be over there

2459
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:39,520
next slides please just skip it give me

2460
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,000
time

2461
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:42,719
and basically oh and i can't go back to

2462
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,360
one slice

2463
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:45,920
so basically what we proposed uh would

2464
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,280
be

2465
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:48,800
for this particular design only we're

2466
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:50,639
not saying this must be the one and the

2467
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:52,159
solved issue multi-domain and we need

2468
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,040
two extensions to auto

2469
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:57,040
one is segment discovery basically means

2470
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,280
let's really discover the whole path

2471
01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,239
uh from the given source to the

2472
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,400
destination if you

2473
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:03,759
you spam multiple domains and we feel

2474
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:07,040
that this is a very interesting

2475
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:08,719
good extension and this extension even

2476
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,400
would be useful by itself essentially

2477
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,480
somehow open the bgp

2478
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,080
uh interface would be very useful by

2479
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,559
itself and then of course after you

2480
01:37:14,080 --> 01:37:16,400
found

2481
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,000
the segments with auto servers involved

2482
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,920
using some kind of chaining

2483
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,440
and then you also want to be able to uh

2484
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,920
discover extend auto

2485
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:25,599
uh your ecs and custom app services

2486
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,080
therefore you can really discover all

2487
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,920
the

2488
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,360
whole whole vector and then of course

2489
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,520
you can then also would

2490
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,599
extend the auto with multiple operating

2491
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:35,199
modes for example iterative recursive

2492
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,520
hybrid for people who know dns

2493
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,879
is highly highly based on ds recursive

2494
01:37:37,520 --> 01:37:40,960
required multiple servers

2495
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,400
and integrated multiple servers and now

2496
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,360
can you go to the next next slide

2497
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,799
basically i can go to paragraph

2498
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:50,799
yeah you can skip you can skip

2499
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,400
milestones and we probably need to see

2500
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,560
and here is essential

2501
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,519
paragraph so basically what we want to

2502
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,760
do is

2503
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,280
uh extension of auto services to super

2504
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,159
multi-domain settings

2505
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,440
and clearly the current auto framework

2506
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,719
has made it clear how to provide

2507
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:07,839
information for single

2508
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:10,320
server for single network but uh

2509
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,000
devices might traverse multiple networks

2510
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,920
and not in the same domain

2511
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:15,679
so therefore we want to essentially

2512
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,320
extend two things

2513
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:19,440
one is specify multi-auto server

2514
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:21,840
protocol flow

2515
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,280
and user guidelines when auto service

2516
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,320
involves network passes spanning

2517
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,639
multiple domains

2518
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:29,040
a number two extend or introduce auto

2519
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:31,199
services allowing east west interfaces

2520
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:32,320
for multiple auto servers to integrate

2521
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:34,159
and collaborate

2522
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,440
that's a basic proposal i think

2523
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:37,679
important issue and so on

2524
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,199
and specification of course should reuse

2525
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:42,800
it whenever possible

2526
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:44,799
and and the of course you would always

2527
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,080
read the issue of incremental deployment

2528
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,040
because multiple domains would have

2529
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,080
women that will have issue with

2530
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:50,400
increment deployment

2531
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,360
and then uh we must address the issue of

2532
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,119
dynamicity

2533
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:54,799
uh of course we also must address

2534
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:56,559
israel's security and privacy because

2535
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:58,080
right now always a major issue even from

2536
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,520
very beginning i believe the first issue

2537
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,320
always reads about atp

2538
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,440
and comcast email very early on was okay

2539
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,719
and what if

2540
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:06,879
there are all the other people want

2541
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,400
wanted to claim to be my to be the auto

2542
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,320
server for my domain so therefore we

2543
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:13,440
want to address this issue

2544
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:16,480
yeah that's a paragraph

2545
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,199
i think i use that yeah yeah thanks

2546
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:27,759
thank you

2547
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:30,799
yeah so any any comments from flow

2548
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,480
so richard i i think this is a

2549
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:34,719
i i think it's a very important word but

2550
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:37,040
also very challenging because

2551
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,840
you discuss you know cross domain you

2552
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:42,560
know for

2553
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:45,360
each domain may have one auto server how

2554
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,719
may uh for each domain they may own by

2555
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:49,599
different operator how you

2556
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:52,639
you know ask a different operator to

2557
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:55,119
work together to share the information

2558
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:57,040
correct correct so as a first step and i

2559
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:59,440
think our design can you go back to the

2560
01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,480
like a dummy design just very quickly

2561
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:05,040
excellent question

2562
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:07,759
a go back slides more more more

2563
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:09,199
okay yeah i'm sorry uh i think uh you

2564
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:13,199
have to go forward yeah

2565
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:17,119
next next next yeah

2566
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:20,559
next oh i'm sorry i mean next slide okay

2567
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:21,920
one more okay there's one yeah

2568
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,760
no i'm gonna talk about the simple

2569
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:27,280
extension next one

2570
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:30,560
i think there's oh there's okay next one

2571
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:32,960
next one yeah so

2572
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:33,920
absolutely very very good comment and i

2573
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:37,119
think number one

2574
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:39,440
is uh we uh by the way

2575
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:40,159
clear that this is only a a draft

2576
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:44,159
proposal

2577
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:45,440
and uh so we clearly this karma audio

2578
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,239
audit service will be very difficult so

2579
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,919
therefore we thought

2580
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:49,919
one way to solve this issue would be

2581
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,320
using the trust of all

2582
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,360
like a bgp or peer relationship already

2583
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:55,119
established

2584
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,639
among the domains therefore if you look

2585
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:58,320
at this like the dummy design

2586
01:40:56,639 --> 01:41:00,000
and they can give us some exponential

2587
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,759
they can even tell us

2588
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,280
if there's their black hole and how do

2589
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,360
we even have an extra solar for really

2590
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:06,960
discover audio like a

2591
01:41:05,360 --> 01:41:08,719
server so i think that's one way to

2592
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,840
address it so therefore and how they can

2593
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,320
work together

2594
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,199
and to really answer that question is we

2595
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,159
want to have

2596
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:17,519
multiple operation modes iterative for

2597
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:19,519
example always

2598
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,960
uh collect all the information and

2599
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,480
therefore the client will be essentially

2600
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:23,760
making decision itself we don't solve

2601
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,080
the issue we want to specify the

2602
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:28,080
mechanism not the power say so therefore

2603
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,519
uh collect we only provide a mechanism

2604
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,719
to collect all the information but we

2605
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,000
don't make decisions

2606
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:34,320
and then of course we can run like a

2607
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,880
recursive or hybrid therefore

2608
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:37,360
we can introduce essentially this like

2609
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,239
uh

2610
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:42,280
like a proxy and uh and frameworks

2611
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:44,000
through automatic build therefore we can

2612
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:46,480
specific so i think that's

2613
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,080
what we want to solve number one is give

2614
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,119
the complexity to other clients but

2615
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:51,040
introduce the mechanism

2616
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:52,639
and second one at the same time make it

2617
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:54,400
possible that mechanism can also provide

2618
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,400
a solution at least in a

2619
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,920
initial setting i don't know if i answer

2620
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:00,559
a question or not but that's essentially

2621
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:03,520
our current design

2622
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,159
okay thank you for clarification so any

2623
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,159
other comments

2624
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,920
so we can move to the last proposal

2625
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,960
jason

2626
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:21,360
are you ready i think it weeds as well

2627
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:23,040
okay yeah and can you make it quick so

2628
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:25,360
that we have some time for wrap-up

2629
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:25,360
please

2630
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:46,880
okay can you see my screen yep

2631
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:48,799
uh so luis are you representing okay

2632
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,000
yes i'm actually should i go through

2633
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,239
them or jensen

2634
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,239
maybe i can i can start maybe jensen can

2635
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:55,199
compliment so we can go directly to the

2636
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:59,678
next slide and

2637
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:59,678
maybe stay there to the proposed

2638
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:03,440
uh sorry an enemy

2639
01:43:04,159 --> 01:43:08,159
yeah this one yeah that that one maybe

2640
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,280
you're gonna stay here and

2641
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:13,440
until here so essentially the the point

2642
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:15,440
here would be to

2643
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,519
to document best practices and stations

2644
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:19,440
for alto in order to facilitate

2645
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:22,320
operational automation tasks

2646
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:24,159
so it's true that there are already some

2647
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,719
some best practice document and so but

2648
01:43:24,159 --> 01:43:27,679
um

2649
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,480
from that point till now uh there were

2650
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:30,400
newer

2651
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:32,799
auto protocol stations that the ones

2652
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:34,799
that we have discussed today

2653
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,480
and some others because calendar unified

2654
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:38,159
properties and so on so far

2655
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,599
and also there are newer use cases that

2656
01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:43,040
we we are foreseeing

2657
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:46,159
like the closed loop automation that

2658
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:49,760
could come from the ideas from etsy csm

2659
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:52,159
or the some other drafts that are

2660
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,520
available living drafts like the mobile

2661
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:55,040
edge computing or multi-exercise

2662
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,600
computing capabilities

2663
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:59,600
and so on so far all all of these so

2664
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,639
both protocol extensions and new cases

2665
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:02,159
new use cases

2666
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,520
could require additional consideration

2667
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:07,360
so this is this will be one of the

2668
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:09,440
topics to consider here

2669
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,719
what could be those considerations to to

2670
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,638
take into account well

2671
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,840
decisions on the information resource

2672
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:16,080
exposed

2673
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,760
and notification of changes either in

2674
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,280
practice or reactive mode

2675
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:21,199
and i mean the interaction with the with

2676
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:24,639
the application and so to

2677
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:26,879
uh to deploy uh to develop

2678
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,639
new capabilities for an alto for working

2679
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,480
in those different modes

2680
01:44:28,639 --> 01:44:32,960
aggregation processing of the corrected

2681
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:34,959
information so to what extent we need to

2682
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,560
to aggregate the information collected

2683
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,360
and exposed

2684
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:40,880
in a certain manner et cetera et cetera

2685
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,960
so

2686
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,199
this will be one of the of the the sides

2687
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,360
of the proposal the other side is to

2688
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:48,799
consider as well the newer outdoor

2689
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,759
services could require more interaction

2690
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:53,040
with applications

2691
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:55,840
in order to help in the

2692
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,400
aforementioned automation of operations

2693
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,000
so

2694
01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:00,638
essentially on summarizing not taking

2695
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,960
more time so the working group the idea

2696
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:04,560
will be to propose to investigate the

2697
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,880
the best practices in our operational

2698
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,520
automation

2699
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:12,159
including as mentioned before the newer

2700
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,400
extensions and also the newer use cases

2701
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:16,000
and secondly to propose new protocol

2702
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,400
stations to allow applications

2703
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,560
to better express needs in such a way

2704
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,839
that this could be hinge for alto to

2705
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,600
process the information to aggregate the

2706
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:24,400
information and to interact and to

2707
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,000
accommodate

2708
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,080
essentially to the needs of the

2709
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,960
applications and i think that

2710
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:32,960
we can we can stop here for this i guess

2711
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:37,679
yeah so uh thanks luis and good

2712
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:41,040
representation actually

2713
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,360
so my very curious so how fast we can

2714
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:44,800
get

2715
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:46,559
data from southbound in the

2716
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,719
interface actually i think this may

2717
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:51,360
relate to this proposal

2718
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,719
and uh also for for the second actually

2719
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:55,280
i think

2720
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,800
you want to propose a new protocol uh

2721
01:45:55,280 --> 01:46:00,080
for some extension

2722
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,520
i think maybe you know uh maybe you you

2723
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:04,719
only focus on

2724
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:07,760
like a service edge computing uh

2725
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,320
service discovery or you know what kind

2726
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,119
of

2727
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:12,159
uh product extension you expect there

2728
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:14,799
for

2729
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:15,199
this this will this will be this will be

2730
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,000
one

2731
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:18,799
of them at least this is on ongoing work

2732
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,480
there are some

2733
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:24,719
some droughts on that and regarding the

2734
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:26,239
refreshment of the information clearly

2735
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:28,800
we have dependencies on the

2736
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:29,280
on the protocols and and the mechanisms

2737
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:30,960
that we

2738
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:33,519
do for c for that for instance going

2739
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,920
directly to the point of of the

2740
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,040
compute case computed case if we

2741
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:39,760
leverage on

2742
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:41,600
bgpa mechanisms for that for sure we

2743
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,000
have the dependency on the timing of

2744
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:45,520
these

2745
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,440
uh of the dates of of lpp so this is we

2746
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:50,000
have discussed several times this in the

2747
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:51,199
in the weekly calls uh to have a clear

2748
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,840
idea what could be

2749
01:46:51,199 --> 01:46:55,839
let's say the the

2750
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,239
we can refresh and collect the

2751
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:05,920
information this

2752
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:08,559
this is a topic to be analyzed but

2753
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,920
we already have a work in the direction

2754
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,440
of having clear that

2755
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,600
there will be some dependencies and this

2756
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:16,719
we these will uh questions so

2757
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:19,600
not question but with influence the the

2758
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,800
the speed in which we can provide the

2759
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:23,280
information but as

2760
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,400
mentioned before by by having probably

2761
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,679
we

2762
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,519
would not consider although for

2763
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:27,840
something in real time at least yet in

2764
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:32,239
this

2765
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:34,960
space uh so we could

2766
01:47:32,239 --> 01:47:36,559
i think we could live with uh with that

2767
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:39,360
timings by now

2768
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,840
um this was one question on the other

2769
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,119
chain

2770
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:46,000
i forgot the other question was what was

2771
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:47,679
so for for second uh you know you you

2772
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,119
propose a new political extension i'm

2773
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:51,360
just the one and whether you attack it

2774
01:47:49,119 --> 01:47:53,440
to like a service agent service

2775
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:54,239
discovery cases you want to focus on

2776
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,480
extension

2777
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:57,440
yeah let's say that this is is dual in

2778
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,040
the sense that

2779
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:01,360
once you have newer capabilities for

2780
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:03,199
instance the identification of uh

2781
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:05,040
compute environments into the network

2782
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:06,960
you need also to enable

2783
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,080
ways of for the application to ask for

2784
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,719
it so

2785
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:11,360
so how do you you have to consider as an

2786
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,679
extension

2787
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:14,400
how do you collect the information and

2788
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:16,239
and also

2789
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:18,080
how do you expose that information how

2790
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,559
the applications could ask for that so

2791
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:21,519
it would be

2792
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,520
let's say dual

2793
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:25,679
yeah in this slide for instance you can

2794
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:27,440
see uh

2795
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,040
so there would be some way of collecting

2796
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:30,879
the um

2797
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,239
the computing information that could be

2798
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,719
the next information this could be for

2799
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:34,959
instance

2800
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,400
there is some proposition in in this

2801
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:37,040
working group for doing that as a

2802
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:39,759
station of the

2803
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:40,239
te topology model so we could retrieve

2804
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,639
the

2805
01:48:40,239 --> 01:48:44,159
data center information maybe in the

2806
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:47,119
form of these bundles as

2807
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:48,799
in the case of cntt or either the the

2808
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:52,239
raw information about the cpu

2809
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:53,280
and and all of that and also consider

2810
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:56,879
alto server

2811
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:58,480
as the the way of let's say

2812
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,000
processing this information together

2813
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:00,718
with the topological information from

2814
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,199
the network

2815
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:04,239
uh collecting from from bgp such a way

2816
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,320
that we could offer

2817
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:07,599
both the view of the data center plus

2818
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,360
the view of the transport network

2819
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:12,239
together in such a way that we could

2820
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:14,000
allow applications on top of that to

2821
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:16,799
make the better decision for deploying

2822
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,280
applications or instantiating services

2823
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,280
or whatever

2824
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:23,119
okay guys thank you thank you very much

2825
01:49:21,599 --> 01:49:25,679
luis for the comments and

2826
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:26,480
it's good that we had some discussion

2827
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:31,360
and

2828
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:31,360
yeah so i think we need to wrap up um

2829
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:36,320
yeah so so this is something this is

2830
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,400
what we have not planned or discussed

2831
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:39,840
how we go forward from now from here i

2832
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,159
think we had good discussions and i

2833
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:42,639
think

2834
01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:45,920
personally we have heard good arguments

2835
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,920
for all of these extensions

2836
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:56,080
martin is it common to take harms on

2837
01:49:52,480 --> 01:49:58,799
support for each of these charter items

2838
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:59,280
or what is what is a proper or common

2839
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,960
way to

2840
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:02,960
to move forward in this situation

2841
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:11,360
[Music]

2842
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,599
um

2843
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,719
we could do a show of hands i suppose

2844
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:18,159
for for each of

2845
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,119
the um i mean i don't know i mean i

2846
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:21,679
would first

2847
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:22,960
maybe ask do people feel like they

2848
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:27,840
understand these

2849
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:27,840
enough to let's go i guess

2850
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,880
or do we need like do we need to have

2851
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,040
more discussion on these on the list

2852
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:36,239
or are people like ready to vote now

2853
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,599
because everybody has

2854
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:40,400
has their opinions set i think that

2855
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:40,400
would be good to know

2856
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:44,080
good question so yeah comments so for me

2857
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:46,480
personally i think

2858
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,599
um speaking now not as chair but

2859
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:49,199
personally i think

2860
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,960
most of these extensions were pretty

2861
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:53,678
clear um

2862
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:55,360
or at least charter items i should say

2863
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:57,920
um

2864
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:58,639
and i think the text already is already

2865
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,040
in in

2866
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:02,320
somewhat good shape um but that's my

2867
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:05,360
personal opinion

2868
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:07,759
others may want to speak up yeah

2869
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,719
my opinion actually you know i i did a

2870
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,560
full follow the

2871
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:11,840
you know some discussion in the design

2872
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,840
team and i

2873
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:15,440
um this makes me a better understanding

2874
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,400
of what they want to propose and

2875
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,119
i i think for cellular network proposal

2876
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,759
and

2877
01:51:19,119 --> 01:51:23,598
general extension they seem to you know

2878
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:26,320
have some overlapping uh

2879
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:28,000
because as serbian mentioned they may

2880
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:30,000
cover some widest network of

2881
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,199
mobile network cases so this need to be

2882
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,119
consolidated

2883
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:35,040
and also for operation automation

2884
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:37,598
actually as a you know louis represent

2885
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:39,760
actually they also cover service age

2886
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:42,000
discovery which also you know mixed with

2887
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:45,119
general extension so this need to be you

2888
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:46,960
know sort out how how to you know

2889
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:49,839
have clear boundaries between each other

2890
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,840
so

2891
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:55,920
for other two proposals yeah i

2892
01:51:53,599 --> 01:52:03,440
i want to see what other people think

2893
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:06,480
about that

2894
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,480
yes i like comments

2895
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:17,840
richard go ahead

2896
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:31,840
richard do we need we can't hear you

2897
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,840
richard

2898
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,599
okay so number one what i wanted to say

2899
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:38,719
was

2900
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:40,800
uh uh all these five use cases

2901
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:42,800
and the what five extensions that were

2902
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,480
all involved a lot of weekly discussions

2903
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,599
and so basically i think

2904
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:49,598
the this fiberbody among the many many

2905
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:50,800
choices like a relative well understood

2906
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,119
so therefore i think that's why

2907
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:55,840
personally i won't support all five us

2908
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,719
five extensions and of course i i do

2909
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,040
agree with

2910
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:01,040
a team comment that there looks like

2911
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:03,280
some over life you need to be clarified

2912
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:04,880
some like a better delineation of the

2913
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:07,280
boundary so

2914
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:09,040
among some for example i i do buy that

2915
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:11,040
and if i really have to pick and

2916
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:12,480
for example personally for example i

2917
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:15,920
personally think for example

2918
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:18,080
the cellular is incredibly important uh

2919
01:53:15,920 --> 01:53:19,840
extension which actually would give us a

2920
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:22,159
very good opportunity

2921
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,920
from ietf typically is tended to

2922
01:53:22,159 --> 01:53:24,879
slightly stay above layer two earlier

2923
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:26,239
three layer four

2924
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,040
and now really abstract all the

2925
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:30,320
information and work together with 3gpp

2926
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,440
on layer 2 and so on i think the

2927
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,759
wonderful operator would definitely

2928
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,080
should

2929
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:35,920
for example support uh the cellular

2930
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,679
network and so on so

2931
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,800
if we really have to only pick 3 and so

2932
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,280
on i've probably at least i would

2933
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,440
personally

2934
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:43,119
vote for example cellular because that's

2935
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:44,638
such an important use case and such a

2936
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:48,080
good opportunity

2937
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:48,080
so those are just my quick comments

2938
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,000
yeah yeah i have an additional sword

2939
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,159
actually i i think

2940
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,360
uh based on auto protocol actually you

2941
01:53:58,159 --> 01:54:02,159
know they

2942
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:04,320
design uh you know originally designed

2943
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:07,360
for the pwp application city

2944
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:09,599
application now actually uh we see

2945
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,040
uh you know many people talk about 5g

2946
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:14,480
and edge computing and

2947
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:16,480
they could be the bigger driver for uh

2948
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:19,360
for us you know to extend auto program

2949
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:21,598
but we see a lot of you know

2950
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,639
many proposals distributed in other

2951
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:24,719
working groups so

2952
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:27,280
what i like to you know really want to

2953
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:29,679
see is is all the working group can

2954
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:30,960
have good collaboration with other uh

2955
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:34,960
working or some

2956
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:39,119
uh some problems in other directions so

2957
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:39,119
we can you know build synergy for for

2958
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,840
this

2959
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,159
i think luis stopping out you know

2960
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,520
yeah i i would like that simply to

2961
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:02,879
comment maybe a way of

2962
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,239
uh avoiding overlappings or or mixing

2963
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,760
things maybe maybe it could be to

2964
01:55:04,239 --> 01:55:08,480
to look at the putting alto server as a

2965
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:12,320
central point

2966
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:14,480
maybe considering one could be let's say

2967
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,639
what could be the mechanisms for feeding

2968
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:17,839
alto server with information

2969
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:19,040
what would be the mechanisms for

2970
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:19,920
exposing that information to

2971
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:22,080
applications and

2972
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,760
and so basically the the let's say the

2973
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:24,000
normal interface the software interface

2974
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,679
and

2975
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,119
maybe the east-west interface could be

2976
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,960
also an angle to look at

2977
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:30,480
we have the discussed also in the past

2978
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:34,239
in that way so

2979
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:37,199
maybe in that way also we could see uh

2980
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:38,080
could let's say make the the avoid to

2981
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:41,119
overlaps

2982
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:42,960
basically it's just my fault

2983
01:55:41,119 --> 01:55:44,559
yeah yeah louise you have good comments

2984
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,400
you know for feeding in the face

2985
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:48,000
right now we seem to leave this out of

2986
01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,920
scope but you know we think

2987
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,760
we make an assumption you know also it

2988
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,599
will connect all the information

2989
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,040
intelligently you know smartly you know

2990
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:57,119
but we but

2991
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,800
so for so that's why you know uh

2992
01:55:57,119 --> 01:56:00,880
operation automation you know

2993
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:03,199
they may target to address this issue to

2994
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,360
automate to get all the information

2995
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:05,360
so

2996
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:16,960
so being i think you are in a queue

2997
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:28,080
okay um yeah

2998
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:31,360
i am also hesitant uh if i had to choose

2999
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:34,960
i think it is

3000
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:38,719
for me the fact that there is uh uh

3001
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:42,080
overlaps uh is is is a

3002
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:45,199
a good thing because this means

3003
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:48,559
there is also uh synergy

3004
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:49,040
and uh yes indeed uh the the the purpose

3005
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:52,080
of uh

3006
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:56,080
general extension was really to uh

3007
01:56:52,080 --> 01:57:01,199
uh to to to uh to reach out to other

3008
01:56:56,080 --> 01:57:04,800
working group items and for example

3009
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:07,919
an extension so cost attributes

3010
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:11,119
they are definitely useful for

3011
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:12,719
cellular use cases but they may also be

3012
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:16,239
useful for

3013
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:18,560
other use cases that are mentioned

3014
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:20,718
for example that were mentioned by luis

3015
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:25,040
in one of his drafts

3016
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:28,400
so it is kind of uh

3017
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:28,800
i think it it's it it's um it's a good

3018
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:32,320
thing

3019
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:35,679
uh that to have like a placeholder

3020
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:38,159
on extensions and maybe motivated by

3021
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:39,440
other people working on other working

3022
01:57:38,159 --> 01:57:42,799
group items in the

3023
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:42,799
in the in alto

3024
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:54,080
okay so we have just

3025
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:58,159
we have just a couple more minutes left

3026
01:57:56,239 --> 01:58:01,598
and the question is do we want to

3027
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:04,638
show um do a quick show of hands for the

3028
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:04,639
for the items or

3029
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:11,920
uh sorry uh it's me again sorry again

3030
01:58:08,639 --> 01:58:15,679
yes i actually i want also wanted to add

3031
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:18,880
that uh i think to better uh

3032
01:58:15,679 --> 01:58:22,320
understand possible synergies uh

3033
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:26,639
and then that could be consolidated

3034
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:29,920
um in the proposals i think maybe

3035
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,400
it would be interesting for each person

3036
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:34,239
to

3037
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:37,679
uh uh carefully uh

3038
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:41,280
take a look at the slides at the related

3039
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:45,760
material the for example if drafts have

3040
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:49,040
all already been written and maybe

3041
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:52,320
have a round of discussions among

3042
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:54,639
the people involved in these

3043
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:57,040
proposals to see how they can

3044
01:58:54,639 --> 01:59:00,159
consolidate

3045
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:03,840
and to make sure everybody got the point

3046
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:03,839
of everybody

3047
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:10,400
i'm not sure what your proposal is to to

3048
01:59:08,719 --> 01:59:12,639
have further discussions in the

3049
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:13,759
design team meetings and on the mailing

3050
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:16,960
list

3051
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,920
yeah to have to take the time to leave

3052
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,440
some time to

3053
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:21,440
uh uh

3054
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:27,840
to to yes for everybody to to take a

3055
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:29,839
closer look at the proposals

3056
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,760
sabine so that is not that is not what

3057
01:59:29,840 --> 01:59:33,599
we are debating at all here so for sure

3058
01:59:31,760 --> 01:59:34,560
we gonna have further discussions on the

3059
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:36,320
mailing list and

3060
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:38,400
we are not making any decisions here

3061
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:40,080
right now what we can make

3062
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:41,519
however in the remaining two or three

3063
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:44,880
minutes that we have

3064
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:46,239
is have a you know consensus or try to

3065
01:59:44,880 --> 01:59:49,119
find a

3066
01:59:46,239 --> 01:59:50,320
like martin said a show of hands on um

3067
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,920
what is

3068
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:53,599
what is the current status quo what are

3069
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:56,800
people thinking of the um

3070
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:58,159
charter items on the table um for sure

3071
01:59:56,800 --> 02:00:00,159
we're not making any decisions and

3072
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:01,119
further confinement is necessary that's

3073
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:05,199
that's

3074
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:08,320
totally clear yeah so uh yeah

3075
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:08,879
yeah i agree yeah i totally agree i

3076
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:11,360
think

3077
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:12,320
uh sorry slightly different problems you

3078
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:14,239
know i i think

3079
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:16,080
like a more discussion often time means

3080
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:18,718
delay one or three more months that's

3081
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:20,960
probably a horrible thing

3082
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:22,480
and if possible let's make a decision

3083
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:24,320
soon because they're already designing

3084
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:25,199
getting started and so on all these like

3085
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:27,360
momentum

3086
02:00:25,199 --> 02:00:29,280
let's don't say let's discuss even more

3087
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:30,880
for basically means we mislead meeting

3088
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,199
today we probably wait for three more

3089
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,239
months

3090
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:37,280
or four more months

3091
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:40,320
right so um

3092
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:41,679
i guess we're getting uh close to the to

3093
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:46,000
the end of the session

3094
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:46,000
and martin you want to say something um

3095
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,880
yeah i mean like i i i i'm not sure how

3096
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,199
effective

3097
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,040
um you know having a show of hands on

3098
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:58,480
five different things is going to be

3099
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:01,920
in in 30 seconds or whatever we have uh

3100
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:05,919
all right i mean you could

3101
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:08,239
my advice would be to um

3102
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,760
have somebody uh whether it be a chair

3103
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:12,400
or somebody like richard or

3104
02:01:09,760 --> 02:01:13,679
or really anyone else maybe have some

3105
02:01:12,400 --> 02:01:16,719
informal discussions

3106
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:20,320
and and see if there is a

3107
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:23,920
a proposal um for like you know

3108
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:27,519
about one to two years of work uh

3109
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:29,520
built out of these five five proposals

3110
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,880
and then you know do a consensus call on

3111
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,840
that rather than just kind of have a

3112
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,840
completely open-ended

3113
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,599
uh yeah yeah

3114
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:40,320
agree with the martin actually we can

3115
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:42,480
you know

3116
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:43,519
begin to prepare the charter how to

3117
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:46,400
consolidate all these

3118
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:46,800
proposals together to to document each

3119
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:49,920
other

3120
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:53,520
uh have a strawberry uh proposal and uh

3121
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:55,119
actually so we can have a meeting to to

3122
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:58,560
to discuss this and uh

3123
02:01:55,119 --> 02:02:01,598
but uh uh i i think we

3124
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,880
yeah definitely i think we can prepare

3125
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:04,719
these charter texts

3126
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:06,320
yeah yeah i mean i i i don't think it

3127
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:08,560
needs to take a long time but but

3128
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:10,080
um we're not going to have time for like

3129
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,920
a lot of people to come up on the mic

3130
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:15,199
and and sort of say what they want so

3131
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:16,880
so maybe an offline way

3132
02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:18,638
like a not in a meeting way is a good

3133
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,599
way to kind of gauge

3134
02:02:18,639 --> 02:02:23,119
what people think um so the other thing

3135
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:24,960
i want to say is i'm not an ultra

3136
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,679
protection practitioner so i don't have

3137
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,800
a ton of

3138
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,000
um insider opinion on where where would

3139
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:32,000
you go with any of these some of them

3140
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,159
sound harder to me than others

3141
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,280
but uh if if everyone sort of wants to

3142
02:02:34,159 --> 02:02:36,960
do everything

3143
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,639
which is kind of what i'm hearing and

3144
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:39,920
it's sort of being forced to choose

3145
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:42,960
uh some of these are probably much

3146
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:44,560
shorter than than than others

3147
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:46,159
and picking up the short you know having

3148
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:46,960
it rechartering and doing a couple

3149
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:49,280
things that

3150
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:51,280
can wrap up in six months or a year and

3151
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:53,679
then moving to the harder things

3152
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:55,759
is a way to keep everyone engaged uh

3153
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,280
whereas if you like pick the hard things

3154
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:59,119
and you know that drags on for four

3155
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:00,960
years or something because there's

3156
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:03,199
conflicts and people can't reach

3157
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,960
consensus and they're hard problems

3158
02:03:03,199 --> 02:03:06,320
uh then the people with easy problems

3159
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,960
are gonna go away

3160
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:10,320
so um all else being equal i might

3161
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,880
recommend that as a strategy

3162
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:14,320
on how to organize this but uh obviously

3163
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:17,599
you know the consensus of the group is

3164
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:17,599
more important than that advice

3165
02:03:17,679 --> 02:03:21,520
no but for sure that's good advice and

3166
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:24,719
also to take into account

3167
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:26,080
that these items are different and and

3168
02:03:24,719 --> 02:03:28,400
the time they need

3169
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:30,719
um the time i think we should close i

3170
02:03:28,400 --> 02:03:33,119
think i i i agree with what uh

3171
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,760
basically chin and martin just uh agreed

3172
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:35,280
to

3173
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,040
we should take this offline and have

3174
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:38,719
some people lead this i think shin and

3175
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:43,840
and and um

3176
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:43,840
richard are probably uh yeah

3177
02:03:47,360 --> 02:03:50,639
