1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,000
uh hi everybody my name is aaron falk

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,040
this is the hot rfc lightning talk

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
session

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
uh the purpose of this session is to

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
create an opportunity for folks

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,720
who are looking for collaborators in the

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,920
ietf to uh

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
have a chance to speak briefly um talk

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,080
about

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,198
their problem or uh their

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
uh their idea uh and give enough

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
information so

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,360
others who might be interested will know

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
enough to follow up

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,200
and so each talk should include some

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
information on how to collaborate

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
afterwards

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,800
there are in the agenda for this meeting

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,079
there are short abstracts for each of

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
the presentations and they all

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
include email addresses and some include

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
some additional information for how to

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,680
follow up

24
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,839
so really the goal here is to

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,640
to try to connect people together and

26
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,520
um uh the way so this is the first time

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
that we've done this

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,400
uh as a live online meeting um

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,720
i'm sure that most of you have done a

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
lot of live online meetings recently so

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
i think that the

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
mechanics should be pretty familiar

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,560
but because these are intended to be

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,960
lightning talks i'm going to be pretty

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,240
strict about the time allocation so

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,439
you've got four minutes

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,439
when your four minutes are up i'm going

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,158
to interrupt you and ask you to wrap up

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,479
if you haven't already

40
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,479
and

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,240
i will be making

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
just the sort of the webex interface i

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,119
will set you as the presenter when it's

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,560
time for you to present

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
uh and uh um you can show the slides

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,200
from your own machine

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
we've got one case where i'm going to be

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,799
showing the slides

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,719
and i think that is everything

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,159
that i wanted to say to introduce so

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:04,000
um our first speaker is mike mcbride

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:08,399
i'm going to set him to be the presenter

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,878
and um

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
mike if you would uh unmute yourself and

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:14,640
start

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
and i will start with the timer can you

57
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,200
see my screen okay

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,239
you yes now you're doing the present oh

59
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,160
yep looks good

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,840
okay great thank you for letting me do

61
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,319
this so yeah so we

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
have this uh data discovery topic that

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,799
we've been batting around

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,440
several of us and uh we wanted to

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,959
present this

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,959
to this uh crew just to get a feedback

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
uh hopefully others can participate

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,760
maybe someone will tell us we're crazy

69
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,040
or someone will say this has already

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,799
been solved

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
or yeah maybe this is a good idea and we

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,040
need to figure this out so this is data

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
discovery

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,239
we do have a couple drafts that we're

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
kind of describing the problem

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,760
so this did evolve out of a series of

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
edge computing side meetings

78
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,840
this is not edge computing specific but

79
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
we in these edge computing side meetings

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,560
identified a variety of gaps

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
and one of those gaps was data discovery

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,920
discovering data

83
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
uh that's distributed across the edge

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,599
and how to find that data

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,159
across different edge database databases

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
and um needing to evaluate that so

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,399
that's how this

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,159
has created so so what's the problem um

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
the problem is that we wanted to locate

90
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,280
distributed data in a standardized way

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
there are many proprietary ways of doing

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,400
that

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,599
aws macy and ibm has a solution there's

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
many the ways you can do that

95
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,679
but we need to find a standardized way

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,280
of doing so data may be cached

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
copied or stored across multiple

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
locations in the network on route to its

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
final destination

100
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,079
and so we're trying to find a way to do

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
um and we haven't come up with any

102
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
solutions just the problem

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
uh kind of come up with standards-based

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,599
solution to discover where the databases

105
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
exist throughout a network

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,840
first and then where specific data

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
objects are located that we're looking

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
for

109
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,599
so the location of each data store is

110
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
the first level discovery program

111
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,439
uh problem and then the details of the

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
database

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,560
directory is the second level discovery

114
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,680
problem

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,439
so um so what's data data can be

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,519
you know anything the kind of the use

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,358
case that we're looking for is

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
you know finding statistics measurements

119
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,320
temperature one of them is using an

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,320
elevator for instance when you have

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
sensors all over the elevator

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
and you're trying to gather that data

123
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,280
whether it's vibration or breaking

124
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,320
information

125
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
or speed or capacity or whatever and

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,560
then

127
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,159
find out where that look where that data

128
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
is located

129
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,000
and data can be a program it can be a

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,080
service

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,280
and it can be a resource you know cpu or

132
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
memory and things like that so that

133
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,198
we're

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,239
trying to find ways to find that data um

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
so you know what's next so we're trying

136
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
to determine

137
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
if existing protocols will work here to

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,400
do that

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,000
um you know you may be able to find ways

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,599
to extend

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,440
existing protocols um dns for instance

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
uh that may not be a good idea but it's

143
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,199
you know one way that we've been

144
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,759
discover

145
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,240
thinking about of maybe trying to find

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,360
where

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,000
certain data is if not target where a

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,240
new standard protocol may be needed

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,919
we've been we've presented this in coin

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,840
computing in the network research group

151
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
in the irtf

152
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,799
but and we'll be having a discussion

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
this week in this next week in coin

154
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
um but you know maybe if it's if this is

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
valid work then maybe we someday will

156
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
try to

157
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,360
you know create a a working group first

158
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,320
going through the ball so

159
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,039
um that's really that's really it uh

160
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,039
please

161
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,479
look at the drafts this is how you can

162
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,080
contact the authors

163
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,840
you can email me directly if you wish to

164
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,680
help provide some feedback or get

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,359
involved in the work and that's it thank

166
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,039
you

167
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,240
thanks a lot mike um

168
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,400
that was great uh i'm now making uh

169
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,280
your own shepherd the presenter who's

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,840
going to give the next talk

171
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
uh start whenever you like

172
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
so hello everyone i'm iran chef i'll be

173
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,800
talking about

174
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:24,080
ciphertext format this actually is

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,440
related in a way to the same

176
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,479
problem domain as a as mike's in that

177
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,960
he's looking to discover data overall

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:39,199
i'm looking to to be able to

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:42,400
find out uh encrypted data

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,639
and attribute encrypted data

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,638
back to whoever generated it

182
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,680
so there are a lot of standards for the

183
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,120
cipher text the row cipher text

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,960
what do you do when you encrypt

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,400
something what do you get when you

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,680
encrypt something with

187
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,960
aes for example where does the nonce go

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
into

189
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,799
where does the authentication tag and so

190
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
on

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,919
but if you have a huge amount of

192
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,719
encrypted data

193
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
around the enterprise in many many

194
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,520
locations many

195
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,520
databases many files um

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,400
it's just not enough to have a standard

197
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,479
for the ciphertext you need something

198
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,400
else something extra

199
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:36,159
and usually a set of headers

200
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,758
prefixed to your row cipher text

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,319
uh to determine where it's coming from

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,240
and there is surprisingly enough there

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,080
is no standard

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,800
for this kind of metadata

205
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,680
around encrypted data there are some

206
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,000
standards

207
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:00,000
for data in motion

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,720
some standards in the pkcs11 and k-map

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
world but no real no standards

210
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,360
for data trust that apply to more than

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,919
one

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,039
key management system or more than one

213
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,878
library

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,318
so the goal is to have uh

215
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,680
to some degree at least self-identifying

216
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
encrypted data and to enable

217
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,120
interoperability

218
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,560
of encryption libraries and key

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,520
management systems that

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,679
are related to them as the standard

221
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,799
format should include at least

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,598
the identity and the way to version keys

223
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,718
so

224
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
so as to allow for key rotation of

225
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,880
course it needs to be

226
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,080
extensible um just like any other

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,120
broadly used format

228
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:58,320
it's very important for the

229
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,680
data header to allow for detection

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,080
of encrypted data so there must be a way

231
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,279
for someone who doesn't have the keys to

232
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,760
look at this column

233
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,320
and the database and say hey this is all

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,959
encrypted data

235
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
and it it follows this standard and in

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,599
fact

237
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,640
one fixed byte is good enough

238
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,360
uh if you want to detect the crypto data

239
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,319
at scale

240
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,240
and it needs to support granular

241
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,320
sorry granular key management

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,279
where people use key wrapping okay

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,959
derivation

244
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:41,040
to have a very large number of keys

245
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,239
uh possibly a different key for each

246
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,599
encrypted field there is an early draft

247
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,200
of the proposal

248
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:54,320
i'm looking for partners to work on this

249
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,640
with and

250
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,880
if you're interested please reach out to

251
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,760
me email the simplest

252
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
we can set up an informal meeting next

253
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
week

254
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:10,079
and then decide to take it to

255
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,519
it could be a buff it could be sag cfrg

256
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:17,120
or somewhere i haven't even thought of

257
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,279
so again if you're interested my email

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,399
is here and if you have the slides

259
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,160
there's a link to the

260
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,440
very early proposal thank you

261
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,880
thank you very much iran okay

262
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,120
our next speaker is shigea suzuki

263
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
i'm making you the presenter and shige

264
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,079
you can start whenever you like

265
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,079
hi um i'd like to update a provider

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
update on

267
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,439
the blockchain governance initiative

268
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,920
network which i

269
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,519
mentioned several times in the past few

270
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
ideas

271
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,279
i apologize for interrupting can you uh

272
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,599
go into full screen mode

273
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,480
it's um okay okay sorry

274
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,120
it works it's working okay thank you yes

275
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,880
yeah slowly

276
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:19,519
let me provide update on a big game

277
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,519
which is uh um

278
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,959
a multi-stakeholder community for

279
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
addressing issues in the blockchain

280
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,079
ecosystem

281
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,880
with amongst several stakeholders

282
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,640
not only the engineers but also the

283
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,680
regulators consumers and the commercial

284
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
we think that we need a server some

285
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,599
certain kind of

286
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,079
of the problem related to the for

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,519
example

288
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,640
the development how we can um

289
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,680
secure the blockchain system we provide

290
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,040
some way to to tackle with

291
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,160
anti-money learning on scheme

292
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:01,199
for example so we have

293
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,240
uh launched um the group

294
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,399
uh in march finally and

295
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
currently we have two active working

296
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,160
groups which one

297
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
is a governance working group which is

298
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,399
to try to design the community itself

299
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
and i'm one of the co-chair of the

300
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,800
governance working group

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
and the other one is i am privacy and

302
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
key management study group which is

303
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,959
working on

304
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,319
key management or other issues

305
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,680
related to related to the blockchain

306
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,680
um key management

307
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
so um we're currently focusing uh

308
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,959
government's working group is currently

309
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,040
focusing on the mechanisms of organizing

310
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,199
organization of the beginning itself and

311
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,480
we are drafting

312
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,160
two documents one is a process document

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,160
and the other is the ipr portion

314
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,560
document so this is a

315
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,760
usual stuff for the such type of

316
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,399
community but

317
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
we need to the the version which is

318
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
adjusted to

319
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
for us and we are preparing this for the

320
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,200
next uh

321
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,439
general meeting and we'll be ready for

322
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
the transfer is ready soon

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,560
the other thing is that um privacy and

324
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,199
key management study group

325
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,359
which has a two work stream one of them

326
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,839
is a chemical outbreak stream and

327
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
the other the decentralized financial

328
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,600
technologies and privacy identity and

329
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,959
traceability works even that is very

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
long name and

331
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,439
the both of them are currently

332
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,600
developing documented

333
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,920
and there is a um drafts already on the

334
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
google docs so you can leave it if you

335
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
like and

336
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,240
then it is possible to join and

337
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,040
speak up if you have interest or really

338
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,040
like to comment

339
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,760
we are currently planning our first

340
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,920
uh leo general meeting in uh

341
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,880
called block number one meeting in the

342
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,639

on this thing and that you you want to

362
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,040
know more

363
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,880
a little more about this then please let

364

thank you shigea

368
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,760
our next speaker is pascal yurian

369
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,560
and i am going to uh share the slides

370
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,680
from

371
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,680
my machine pascal

372
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,479
you can uh let's see

373
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,479
go to

374
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,839
screen pascal you can start anytime

375
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,079
so this talk is about europe everywhere

376
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,519
anytime which relies on two atf draft

377
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,199
till ssc and tsim an open implementation

378
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,320
of this draft is available at

379
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,959
github next slide please what is a

380
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
concept

381
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,560
you want to put your application online

382
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,239
but for privacy reason

383
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,319
you want to keep control for that

384
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,639
application is embedded in a secure

385
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,160
element securements are several form

386
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,560
factors like sim

387
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,680
by the cal can be also integrated in

388
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,518
stock

389
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,279
securement evaluation assurance level is

390
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,160
about five to six

391
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,720
given a maximum value of seven your app

392
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,600
server works over a tls 1.3 embedded

393
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,800
server

394
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,759
tls sc stands for tls secure element

395
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,120
and is described by an itf draft your

396
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,000
app client works

397
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,120
over tls 1.3 clients which means that

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
client credentials

399
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
are stored and used in a secure event

400
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,079
tls em

401
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,319
im with 1040s identity module is

402
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,800
described by an itf draft

403
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,880
you see on your right your app working

404
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,000
on the tds 1.3 embedded server

405
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,000
over an external tcp interface next

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,120
slide please

407
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,639
so why tls 1.3

408
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
because it is a state of art for

409
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,920
communication security

410
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,160
it is a result of several years of

411
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,599
debates between security experts at the

412
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,439
atf

413
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,079
reverse is announced by diphylmanic

414
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,560
change over elliptic curve

415
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,439
channel security relies on authenticated

416
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,719
encryption

417
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,319
with associated data server and client

418
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
authentication are based either on

419
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,399
public key infrastructures

420
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:15,359
api or pressure key pskr so tls

421
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:18,559
gssc 1.0 works with il ccmc pursuits

422
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:22,240
ap curve dpl mod and 32 bytes

423
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:26,160
pusher key next version will support

424
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
pki next slide please

425
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:35,520
this slide shows an application oh sorry

426
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,639
it's is it the the next slide so

427
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,879
can you go before

428
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,400
uh okay so

429
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,400
i am lost okay

430
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,879
so this slide

431
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,520
show and tls 1.3 basic exchange you

432
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
using

433
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,799
tls im and tls ac

434
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,919
psim is optional you you can choose a

435
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
pressure key

436
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,120
based on password the rush of a password

437
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,320
for example

438
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,439
and your app is running

439
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,439
over the tls sc application

440
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,360
and embedded in a secure element and the

441
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,960
psr act as a kind of

442
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,399
super open code so next slide

443
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
please so this slide show you

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
an application example a blockchain key

445
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,880
store the right part show ascii command

446
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,440
used to generate t to set key to compute

447
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
key

448
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
according to the bib 32 specification

449
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
and to sign transaction

450
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,000
the left part is a locus prototype board

451
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,160
an arduino mini issue that is

452
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
used as reader for secure elements it

453
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,520
manages

454
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
the iso 786 in protocol and provides you

455
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,918
interface

456
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,640
with the wi-fi sock the wi-fi sock as a

457
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,880
tcp stack and perform network

458
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,000
network exchange so next slide please

459
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,960
squarability is an important issue still

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
open

461
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,880
is it possible to deploy your arp in the

462
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
internet that's the question

463
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,360
on the left a tribal use case a simple

464
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,520
socket ipn port is used

465
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,959
as illustrated in the middle parts

466
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,679
multiple ports

467
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,600
may be used with single ip address and

468
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,400
finally on the right a single socket

469
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,320
ipn port is used by several several name

470
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,080
server name is an extension included in

471
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,240
the tslo message

472
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
so secure elements can be identified by

473
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,880
example by 15-bed

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,679
by locating the answer to reset message

475
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,300
as described in the ts pc draft

476
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,360
so next slide please

477
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:53,840
[Music]

478
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:53,840
and and i'm thank you for attention

479
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,799
okay uh thank you pascal

480
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,158
i need to stop sharing here

481
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,360
next speaker is uh lee

482
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,520
zhao uh and

483
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,840
uh she's going to be talking about dying

484
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,879
cast

485
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,120
deja i'm making you the presenter and

486
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,120
you can start whenever you're ready

487
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,879
okay

488
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,720
um hello uh this is israel speaking i'm

489
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,919
going to

490
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,840
give a briefing on the dimecast or the

491
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,200
dynamic anycast

492
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,678
uh a quick capture of

493
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
the idea is trying to routing the

494
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,760
service request

495
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:03,840
based on both the computing and the

496
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,840
network metrics

497
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,240
okay this this page it tries to uh

498
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,440
to to illustrate the problems in edge

499
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,000
computing

500
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,679
uh with the increased deployment of

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,320
electric

502
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,880
from the operators we find that there

503
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
could be

504
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,360
a very large number of edge sites for

505
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,320
example there could be a couple of

506
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,280
address for each district within a big

507
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
city

508
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,840
and another feature of the edge is they

509
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
have very limited

510
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,480
computing resources and the computing

511
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,918
resources are varying all the time for

512
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,159
each of the sites

513
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
so naturally it comes to a question

514
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
which edge

515
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,320
is the best to route a computing demand

516
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
too

517
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,080
so here we try to focus focus on the

518
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,120
computing

519
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,678
uh service so um there are

520
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,719
three aspects we want to consider the

521
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
first one

522
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,200
which one is the best we need to

523
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,000
consider the computing resources

524
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,440
and the load attached to a particular

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,919
edge site

526
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
um probably want to choose the most

527
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,320
lightweighted one

528
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,639
and the second to consider is the what's

529
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,158
the

530
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,200
net network path quality to a particular

531
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,559
edge and what's the network status

532
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,400
uh and the third aspect is since the

533
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,240
computing resources and the

534
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,720
network status all vary over time so we

535
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,840
want to know all this information in

536
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,200
real time

537
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,480
so that's the problem we are trying to

538
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,159
uh tackle on so to illustrate the

539
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,200
concept of dying cast

540
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,480
here uh here i'm using a

541
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,360
like like a 5g uh 5g

542
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,440
deployment here as for illustration

543
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,678
purpose but it's not necessarily to be

544
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,799
the 5g backhaul

545
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,240
deployment so basically we have two

546
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,480
uh mec style embassy sites and there is

547
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,520
a there is a client comes in

548
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,840
and then um with the most

549
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,080
current practice normally this edge

550
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,439
computing request will be handled by

551
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,480
the local embassy site which is site 1

552
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,679
here but it could possible that

553
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,120
for example because in working hours the

554
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,640
industrial park usually have

555
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,678
much higher load in the residential area

556
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,280
normally not so in some of the cases uh

557
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,600
the the uh the cfn node here which is a

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,520
mini data center gateway here can can

559
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,678
determine that

560
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,520
this this computing request would be

561
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,880
best handled by

562
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,240
the mec site too so that's

563
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,440
the green line shows where the data

564
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
flow goes so the client normally use the

565
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,760
anycast address

566
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,080
to access a service and this package

567
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,039
will be routed to the best edge

568
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,760
in terms of both the computing resources

569
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,919
and the load and also the network status

570
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,799
and which one to be chosen is

571
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,600
transparent

572
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,600
to the client all clients is the adding

573
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
cast address to access the

574
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,840
service that's why we call it the

575
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,720
dynamic ending cost

576
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,600
so that would we we presumably there

577
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
should be some

578
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,279
protocol change both the data plane and

579
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,720
the control plane so

580
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,720
the the brown arrow lines there uh

581
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,880
indicate there should be some control

582
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,840
plane uh information change

583
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
from the server to the uh to the data

584
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,240
center gateways and

585
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,400
also between between the uh

586
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
between the data center gateways all the

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,880
cfl nodes which are the blue

588
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,240
lines here so we want to actually we

589
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,240
want to propose

590
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,440
three features to be supported in

591
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,360
dyncast

592
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,600
the first one is the ending cost-based

593
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,559
service addressing methodology

594
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,840
then the second one is to ensure the

595
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,440
flow affinity

596
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,240
then the third one is the computing

597
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
aware routing

598
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
to this this slide show the activities

599
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,600
we are going to have

600
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,840
for the comp for the coming idea week we

601
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,559
are having a side meeting on wednesday

602
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
uh it starts five minutes after the itf

603
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,720
plenary

604
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:18,559
ends so it will be a 75 session

605
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,760
uh so the webex can be found here

606
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,799
and also the webex can be found on the

607
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,919
side meeting wiki which is uh url here

608
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,400
so the purpose of it we are we're trying

609
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,720
to

610
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,640
understand the use case problem space

611
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
and review the framework and also

612
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,520
discuss the potential work and the where

613
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,559
to fit them

614
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:43,279
in its so you're welcome to join us

615
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:46,720
thank you thank you very much

616
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,320
uh we our next speaker i think may not

617
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,279
have uh joined yet um do we have

618
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,240
uh zidago sako on the call i'm not

619
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,360
seeing

620
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,159
anybody by that name and the

621
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,158
participants

622
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,760
okay i think not i'm gonna move on to

623
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,159
the next talk

624
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,640
so massimo nilo is going to talk about

625
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,640
android explicit monitoring app as soon

626
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
as i can make him the presenter

627
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:25,840
okay massimo you can start whenever

628
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:25,840
you're ready

629
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:33,520
okay my name is martimoni

630
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,200
i will present our work about an android

631
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:41,039
split monitoring application

632
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,600
uh what are the goals our goal was

633
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,440
the mobile tool for traffic performance

634
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,000
monitoring

635
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,640
of increased transfer protocols also

636
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,559
using

637
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,640
the explicit flow method for measuring

638
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,158
the switches flow measurements employ

639
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
few marking leads

640
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,720
inside the heater of each pocket for

641
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,158
lost and the lame turmeric

642
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,520
is protocol independent it is valuable

643
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,080
particularly for encrypted headers

644
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,080
for quick

645
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,480
the idea was to giving the monitoring

646
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
power

647
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,360
to customers our application is a

648
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,879
android application based on the

649
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,000
ericsson spin dump

650
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,279
open source code then okay the name of

651
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,320
our

652
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,840
session is team quick

653
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,799
presentation and up up live demos

654
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,559
and uh the extern that is just it has

655
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,879
just finished

656
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,240
the first idea was already introduced in

657
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,279
the last uh

658
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,159
after ssc in july and

659
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,679
was all to miso network performances

660
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,600
with user devices

661
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,520
there is a youtube video that you can

662
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,480
see

663
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,960
there are also two related drafts that

664
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,000
describes the details our uh

665
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,039
the idea the ideas behind and the

666
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,559
details

667
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,039
one is about explicit flow measurements

668
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,918
and the second one that is just a new

669
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,559
draft

670
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,960
is a user device explicit monitoring

671
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,960
here are

672
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440
here is is the link to the project to

673
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,559
the library

674
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,559
something on github

675
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,559
here there is some screenshots of the

676
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,840
application

677
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,320
the idea is to play is placing the

678
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,439
splits performance server on the user

679
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,480
device

680
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,559
that gives many advantages for example

681
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,320
in terms of scalability in the

682
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,120
measurement precision

683
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,399
and in saving and hardware deployments

684
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,918
are the deployment for the probe

685
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,719
a good idea was to have a real-time

686
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,240
mobile traffic monitoring in this

687
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,240
example you can see the

688
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,279
for example the list of connections and

689
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,240
the details

690
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,240
of the of the measurements

691
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,279
uh exactly for example uh when you

692
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,600
launch

693
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,559
the youtube application with the video

694
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
that flows

695
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,120
continuously you can see directly in

696
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,918
real time what happens to your

697
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,639
connections

698
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,200
on the network and what are the the

699
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,120
measurement about the time or loss

700
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,960
and what kind of connection are you

701
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,399
using

702
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,880
the operators with the customer

703
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,639
permission may use this information to

704
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,559
identify network problems

705
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,120
and pro improve their customer

706
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,120
experience

707
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,120
what are the main main features of the

708
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,678
application of this mobile application

709
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,479
the first is the customer choose whether

710
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,240
to mark

711
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,320
is mobile traffic or not to mark

712
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,440
making it monitorable by the android

713
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,240
application and the network probes

714
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,679
the second feature is also that the

715
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
customer choose whether

716
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,039
to share the performance data for

717
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,760
example

718
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,240
uh that the option is mobile phone as

719
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,279
collected

720
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,640
uh the first the third feature is

721
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,080
that um should be

722
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,720
possible in the future to put

723
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,960
performance ratios on the probe

724
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,360
in order to signal connections with

725
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,279
problem to the network operator

726
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,399
thus the network probes will primarily

727
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,200
monitor only

728
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,320
the the connections that are affected by

729
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,360
impairment

730
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,918
on loss or delay and help to localize

731
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,918
the problem

732
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,678
uh if you want to

733
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,158
next monday and we have the icpm

734
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,880
working group meeting and we will

735
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,960
present

736
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,440
our tutor um and also okay we

737
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,720
