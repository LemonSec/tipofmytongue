1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,439
screen

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,080
two

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:31,840
this seems different than last time yeah

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:31,839
it's a little bit different but

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
we are at the bottom of the hour

6
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,559
okay it is not letting me

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,320

8
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,320
i can only get in with firefox

9
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,720
for me using firefox using firefox but

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,000
it's not letting me publish my screen

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,960
it says now new screen's been shared

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
screen sharing has started are you

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,320
seeing anything

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
no it just says it's being started and

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,479
shows 0k

16
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,479
and then it dies

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
we're using the publish screen

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
money is that what you're trying yes i'm

trying

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,559

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
to do with

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,000

no well all right here's our agenda we

82

have a

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
uh packed agenda today probably the

84
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,599
busiest agenda we've had in years

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,560
um so and not a lot of time so uh

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
these are the items we plan to cover

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
anybody want to

88
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:47,359
bash this agenda any anything to add

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,479
subtract multiply divide

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
okay all right let's move on to the

91
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,280
status of

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
active working group docs

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,919
so since last we met

94
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:07,520
since 108 the deprecate asm draft

95
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,400
has become has been published as rfc

96
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,919
8815

97
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,840
so um we're happy to have that

98
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:19,120
there and it's um you know it's been

99
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,840
actually applied as a bcp in uh

100
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,000
internet 2 already so that's having an

101
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,239
impact

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,280
the multicast problems draft that was

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,479
sitting that's been sitting in ietf last

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,520
call for a while there were

105
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,080
several discusses and it looks like mike

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,240
just updated that um mike do you want to

107
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,280
give a very brief

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,639
mention about what um

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,679
what uh on the updates on that one

110
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,800
yeah so um alyssa

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,240
and a couple other actually ads

112
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
mentioned a whole list of things that we

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,319
needed to change

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
there um it kind of was a depressing

115
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
amount of discusses

116
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
actually so we kind of just working on

117
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,800
it for

118
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,680
for quite a while but um

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
recently got motivated to just get it

120
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
done

121
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,599
and so i addressed all of alyssa's

122
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,719
comments

123
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,960
we're just waiting for her response

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
she said she'll get next week and then

125
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,239
um

126
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
the next two sets of discussions are

127
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,240
actually manageable

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,120
so we'll get them done we are proud of

129
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
this draft

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
and we keep being told that it's a good

131
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
draft but we just need to make it so

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,560
that

133
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,318
the different areas like transportary

134
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
and others are satisfied with things

135
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,080
that are confusing to them so we're

136
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
we'll get it we haven't given up and we

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,318
will get it done and

138
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,159
i'm confident that by uh next itf it

139
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,280
will all be done

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,199
okay and the changes are not massively

141
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,840
substantive it's more clarifying

142
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,280
so we don't necessarily need to run

143
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,039
another working that's right

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,198
or what do you think that's right that

145
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,318
should that's that's correct

146
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,919
it's just a lot of people are not

147
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
familiar with multicast a lot of people

148
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,758
are not familiar with

149
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,240
wi-fi and this draft addresses both and

150
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,160
so we have to just kind of

151
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
not make assumptions that people know

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,800
what certain things mean and so we have

153
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
to expand it

154
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,160
and just explain things a little bit

155
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,759
more

156
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,800
gotcha all right cool thanks mike

157

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,320
jake um so jake uh

173
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,240
two things jake did you

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
i got your multicast to the browser

175
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,399
drafts

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,640
slides did you send something for mnet

177
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,680
oh i uh i combined them because you said

178
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,680
you were compiling oh yes

179
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
okay great cool now would you like to

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,440
drive or do you want me to drive

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,080
and you tell me to advance uh

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
why don't you drive i haven't tried the

183
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
screen share right here

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,000
you guys sharing enough sure i've closed

185
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
everything yeah

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,839
all right let's bring that up

187
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,880
i it you know if you can i can i can

188
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,240
find it if you need me to

189
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,240
uh i got it i had that it kicked me out

190
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,440
in order to get

191
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:19,120
firefox to let me

192
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:22,480
present and now that i am

193
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,120
oops there it is

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
yeah so i framed the the slides as an

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,040
update on

196
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,519
on our multicast browser uh project uh

197
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
of which all three of the currently

198
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
adopted

199
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
uh drafts that are listed there uh are

200
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
are

201
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,319
already apart but also the m-nat is

202
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,359
driven by the same project so i

203
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,079
i just kind of combined them together

204
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,720
so that's what i'll be going over when

205
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,719
we get there

206
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,880
okay this was i guess i can

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
i can say my name too i'm jake holland

208
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,000
supposed to do that still right

209
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,800
looks like it's hanging out

210
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
it is uh yeah yeah we had the screen

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,040
being shared notification and then

212
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
it went

213
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,839
yeah i'm trying to bring it's a pdf

214
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,839
and move it into it

215
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:40,560
should i give it a try then you can

216
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
um it might be better if you

217
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,720
i don't try how this works but uh it

218
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
it might make things even worse who

219
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,959
knows

220
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:58,160
yes things have changed since last

221
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
uh do you really want to share your

222
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,279
screen

223
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,079
yes i will try it does this

224
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,079
does that show up

225
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
nope we're still waiting it says his

226
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
being started

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,120
let me take one more shot at this can

228
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:21,920
you unshare jake

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,920
yeah uh

230
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
unpublish your screen there okay we got

231
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,600
it uh

232
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
we got it it did work

233
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,439
and does that show in presentation mode

234
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,880
perfectly this works go forward this

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,920
works okay so we're there

236
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,360
we'll do it all right so hi i'm jake

237
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,800
um what i'll be going over is uh

238
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,519
updates about our our multicast to the

239
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,519
browser project

240
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:55,519
since uh ls presented on it at ietf 108

241
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,560
we have several trials in progress um

242
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,000
the the browser api implementation

243
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,479
is coming along uh not

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,160
everywhere we want it to be yet but uh

245
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,200
but getting there uh

246
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,920
doc status and next steps for a few uh

247
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,920
things where i think the docs are ready

248
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,279
to take some actions

249
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,079
um and then i'll be spending

250
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,600
probably about half the time if i can on

251
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,359
on the new multicast nat

252
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
draft i'll go over a little bit of why

253
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,800
i'm doing it what i'm hoping it to

254
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,319
achieve with it

255
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,439
and then how it works and what it does

256
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,200
and then pause for discussion on next

257
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,680
steps

258
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
uh so the trials we've got eight isp

259
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,279
partners that have signed on

260
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,439
to um have agreed to do testing with us

261
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,560
uh and to try this stuff out

262
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,079
plus a number of uh of content owners

263
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,079
that are

264
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,439
geo relevant that will be making sure

265
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,120
that their content is

266
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
uh is something that we're able to

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,639
transport uh

268
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,880
properly um we were aiming to

269
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
to wrap things up uh this year which i

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,760
think with a couple of the partners we

271
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
might do who've already started

272
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,800
uh with some of the ones that are still

273
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,839
waiting to start

274
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,880
uh we are extending into into the next

275
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,600
quarter

276
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,959
um that that might be going as late as

277
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,160
march but we're hoping to be

278
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,800
all done uh with our with our sort of

279
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,600
initial examination trials by then

280
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,920
uh the the structure of the trials uh at

281
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
least

282
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,240
phase one is lab testing what they're

283
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
going to be doing is setting up the

284
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,639
multicast ingest platform that we

285
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
published

286
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,000
we've talked about that before that's

287
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,399
running essentially

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,920
a dryad based amt gateway system that um

289
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,800
that uses dryad to ingest global

290
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,760
traffic according to the fgs we've got

291
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,279
and then

292
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,120
also we'll be applying the seaback logic

293
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,120
to

294
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,160
uh to uh ensure that the traffic stays

295
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,720
within

296
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,719
boundaries um that'll be attached

297
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,839
are you using

298
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,519
at the access router point um

299
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,079
which is which would be just uh

300
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,680
deploying the the ingest platform at

301
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,199
access routers where they where they

302
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,120
want the uh the

303
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,758
traffic to be multicasted across that

304
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,240
access um

305
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
so depending on on their deployment

306
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
plans for this

307
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
if it uh if it serves their needs then

308
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
they'll be

309
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,399
uh testing it in both of those ways uh

310
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,680
the traffic that we'll be running

311
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,000
is uh we have uh

312
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,359
these are both still proprietary at this

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
point they're essentially

314
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,199
kind of the same thing as flute but not

315
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
actually flute because it's not encoded

316
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,160
in the same way but it's using

317
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,560
um it's using fec based

318
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,600
stuff for essentially reliable multicast

319
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,920
delivery

320
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
um and we've got implementations of both

321
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,079
of these so they'll be running those to

322
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,199
uh to make sure that the traffic as we

323
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,399
intend to deploy it

324
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,160
uh is going to you know that it's

325
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,759
plausible that it will serve the needs

326
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,160
that they have um

327
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,839
so for that we're still uh we're still

328
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,519
talk we're still trying to get

329
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,279
like uh the right level of engagement

330
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,279
with uh some of the game

331
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,439
downloaders which we think has has

332
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,680
driven a lot of the interest in this

333
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,639
um you know everybody recognizes that

334
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,599
those big

335
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,759
video game downloads has become a strain

336
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,560
on the network for a lot of cases

337
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,079
um and the the live video also is is

338
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,160
still of interest but the

339
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,000
the game downloads we do think is is a

340
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,199
critical component of this

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,480
um and we basically got some survey

342
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,279
questions that we'll be asking them to

343
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
answer

344
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,480
uh and it's an evaluation of cbac

345
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,799
and the overall viability of the system

346
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,039
the the question we're looking to get

347
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,319
answered is whether the isps would

348
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,760
actually deploy this if we were running

349
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,280
production traffic

350
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,319
uh that could be reached in this way and

351
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,160
had it uh had it deployed at scale

352
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,000
and that will inform our decision of

353
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
whether to you know commit all the

354
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,359
resources

355
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,799
to this to to turn it into a real uh

356
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,799
production system

357
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,480
right now it's it's all still kind of

358
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,080
prototype it's not

359
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,280
it's a little questionable to call it

360
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,280
suitable for production but

361
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,960
but with that said we

362
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,199
we are looking still to do possibly an a

363
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,480
b

364
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
production test using um using some real

365
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,080
traffic from

366
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,080
uh from a real content provider uh if we

367
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
have any content providers that

368
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,840
end up signing on to this and network

369
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
operators that

370
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,080
that think it's reasonable enough to try

371
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,720
it we think this is somewhat plausible

372
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,159
because

373
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,840
our um our uh

374
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,400
our our video system that we've got will

375
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,879
uh transparently work over unicast if

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,919
it's

377
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,880
uh if it can't do the multicast so

378
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,320
um that's sort of a critical component

379
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,200
of this

380
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
of this whole architecture um we're

381
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
still looking to

382
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,559
to possibly do that but we won't know uh

383
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,918
for at least a few months whether we

384
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,120
intend to go forward with the production

385
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:33,039
test at this time or not

386
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,479
the sum of the isps

387
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,280
depending how you count two or three of

388
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,559
them are going to need the mnat thing

389
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,000
um in order to to run this first pass at

390
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,799
the trial

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
for for some reason or i should say are

392
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,799
going to need

393
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
something that solves the problems that

394
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,679
mnat solves uh

395
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,200
whether whether it's mnet as uh

396
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,840
as i'm writing it up or not uh

397
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,360
is is not necessarily clear yet but um

398
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,918
but that's part of why i'm working out

399
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,678
the uh

400
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,039
the prototype to actually try it out for

401
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,919
those trials and see if

402
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,720
see if it meets their needs um and we've

403
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,080
also been

404
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,240
uh digging through our log line are

405
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,918
our logs of of the actual traffic that

406
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,200
we send in production to try and

407
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
estimate like

408
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
how much of the gain are we going to get

409
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,879
out of this and that that

410
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,320
should hopefully in some anonymized

411
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,280
sense uh will

412
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,399
will try to present um the results of

413
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,399
that analysis

414
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,919
at an upcoming meeting probably in march

415
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
or july

416
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
uh but that's sort of the outline of

417
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
what we're doing with the trials

418
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,400
and how they stand now um

419
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
there have been two partners that have

420
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,919
actually set up the multicast ingest

421
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,280
platform in lab and are

422
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,160
you know currently engaged in in trying

423
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
to

424
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,280
hook it up to their systems and get it

425
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
transported all the way through their

426
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,480
cpus

427
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,080
i haven't heard yet whether any of them

428
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,559
have succeeded at that yet they've got

429
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,039
like a

430
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,480
a few hops uh working fine but they're

431
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,400
still working through all the uh

432
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
all the challenges in you know working

433
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,840
with the the rest of their

434
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,840
uh stack uh so

435
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,400
a link to the repo there um it's not yet

436
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
in the

437
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,440
uh in the chromium canary um but we're

438
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,320
trying to get a dev trial started this

439
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,400
month which should

440
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
put it into the chromium canary which

441
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,080
would be accessible through

442
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,760
a command line flag or or like the

443
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,158
you know the chrome flags page where you

444
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,039
can turn on experimental features

445
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,720
they've actually updated that process

446
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,360
recently and and we think it's actually

447
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,039
uh

448
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,959
going to be helpful for for making that

449
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,600
happen but that felt a little stalled

450
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,760
until

451
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,799
until we were looking at what it's going

452
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,400
to take to start that

453
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,840
and we're trying to get the right

454
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,280
engagement to get that to

455
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,039
actually begin and get our code checked

456
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,559
into chromium now

457
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,879
um there's still a whole lot of work to

458
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,879
do though and

459
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
so it won't be we won't be able to do an

460
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,960
origin trial

461
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,880
probably like if we're in that position

462
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,080
by july i'd be really happy but it might

463
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
even be

464
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,439
it might take longer than that uh

465
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,720
because we're definitely get before we

466
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,120
can do an origin trial we're gonna have

467
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,799
to

468
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,360
to solve uh ambi and probably do the um

469
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,918
do the tag review which is i'm expecting

470
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
will be

471
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,679
uh will be a bit of a grind and take

472
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,280
some back and forth so

473
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
and might have impact on what we do with

474
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,399
the docs

475
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,919
uh so the docs uh that we have here

476
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,280
um i recently posted an update to

477
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,000
uh dorms and back and ambi but the ambi

478
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,120
one was

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,520
not very extensive um so i think

480
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,479
dorms right now has all the known dvds

481
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,639
and feedback

482
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,039
done i added i added the missing ayanna

483
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,799
stuff

484
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,320
and checked it against the yanguide lens

485
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,799
that resulted in some changes

486
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,610
so right now from the working group

487
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,120
we're looking for

488
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,719
[Music]

489
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,799
a yang doctor review to begin

490
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
i think it's a reasonable and

491
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
appropriate time

492
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,080
um if there's changes that come out of

493
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,918
that then it would be good to get that

494
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,120
you know as soon as quick as soon as we

495
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,840
can uh

496
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,000
not clear whether the changes if they

497
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,918
happen would go into

498
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,400
into our trials or whether they'd be

499
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,400
sort of follow up afterwards and just

500
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,480
make a claim that we believe that can it

501
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,919
can be equivalent

502
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,640
we're also we think it's a good time to

503
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,240
do an

504
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,320
a request for early allocation of the

505
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,400
service name dorms

506
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,760
for ianna if we think this is the

507
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,000
the way it'll go and i also had a

508
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,640
question about whether to request a

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,120
cluster

510
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,000
for the dorm seaback and ambi drafts

511
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
which are

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,840
seaback and envy are built on top of

513
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,959
dorms as an extension

514
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,840
uh so and then the sea back updates

515
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
um likewise most of the tbds are

516
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,639
finished there's

517
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
there's a couple uh remaining that are

518
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,039
there in the drafts

519
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,240
um in that draft but

520
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:19,520
we one of the things we had was to uh

521
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,240
to request a review from the transport

522
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
area about the circuit breaker behavior

523
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,080
they being the experts on what circuit

524
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,918
breakers should do and stuff

525
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,000
um and then i'm not sure whether we want

526
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,400
to do the yang doctor review of seaback

527
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,600
at the same time as dorms

528
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,520
with a sort of joint yang doctor review

529
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,879
or whether we should do the dorms one

530
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,279
first and then

531
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,320
that will obviously if there are changes

532
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:46,720
drive uh

533
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:51,120
drive changes to uh to see back as well

534
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,039
uh so i guess should we

535
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,600
discuss that now or should we bring that

536
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:58,720
up after

537
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,719
i can pause here for

538
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,320
um first do we have do we have our ad

539
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,520
here is warren i'm not seeing warren in

540
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,678
the list is warren

541
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,679
in

542
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,520
um yeah so why don't we continue

543
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,159
on with the updates and then at the end

544
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,400
to kind of see where what we should

545
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,840
okay that works for me next um

546
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,760
there's a question wait hold on there's

547
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,199
a question

548
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:37,039
from robert

549
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,919
how do i add him is my audio coming

550
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,960
through

551
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,600
yes i can hear you all right yes

552
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
i don't see warren here either um but in

553
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,559
terms of the young doctor review

554
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,200
i would suggest it'd be easier to put

555
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,760
them through together um and request the

556
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,120
same

557
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,720
personal review both of them assume

558
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
there's quite a lot of context

559
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,120
content and context shared between the

560
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,240
two

561
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,760
you'll make it an easier job for the

562
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,880
reviewer to understand both of them at

563
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,320
the same time

564
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
and give more appropriate feedback so

565
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:15,840
that's my recommendation

566
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:15,840
that makes good sense to me thank you

567
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,799
uh anyway so multicast net um

568
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
during the course and you're thinking um

569
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,440
by the way you're thinking early review

570
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,880
i i assume there's there's different

571
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
states yeah so they're doing

572
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,880
review uh i put a link uh in

573
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,400
in this in the slides to the page that

574
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,240
describes what the request

575
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,919
looks like um there's a so yeah please

576
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,200
i guess if you can take a look at that

577
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,799
and and let's follow up with

578
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,200
any questions you've got for me about it

579
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:01,918
like i'm i don't have anything to add to

580
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,039
to what that document says for how we

581
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,400
should do the yang doctor

582
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,158
request i think um

583
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
but uh i think it's just a matter of

584
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
like

585
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,279
uh i'm not sure if there's a button in

586
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,960
the data tracker or if you send an email

587
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
i think they had a mailing list where

588
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,279
the request goes

589
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,678
uh perhaps but um but it was supposed to

590
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,159
come from the chairs i think it said so

591
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,000
uh if you agree that these docs seem

592
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
seem ready to move to that stage then i

593
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,279
would be grateful for their feedback

594
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,279
at the earliest chance we can get yeah

595
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,840
all right so um if there's nothing else

596
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
about those docs and the actions there

597
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,799
then i'll move on to multicast nat

598
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,279
so during the course of trying to

599
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,799
arrange all the trials that we've been

600
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,400
trying to arrange for the

601
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,600
um uh for the evaluation of our

602
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,159
of our uh architecture for the external

603
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,799
deplo

604
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:03,279
you know ingest ingest of external

605
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,720
traffic

606
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,440
into a into an isp and delivery to their

607
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,240
end users uh there were several

608
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,440
different stoppers that were brought up

609
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,400
along the way for so some of the

610
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,520
networks

611
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,279
were satisfied that that we

612
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,559
might be able to address some of these

613
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,679
stoppers during the trials

614
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,520
and uh so

615
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,039
and would like to go forward with

616
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,158
something that tries to address those

617
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,279
stoppers and see if

618
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,559
if uh if we can go ahead and and get

619
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,559
multicast to work for them uh others

620
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
of the isps we talked to you know

621
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,520
declined to participate in the trials

622
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,399
citing some of these issues uh as

623
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,520
as reasons that they uh don't think it's

624
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,158
plausible at this time

625
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,440
to uh to do anything with it that

626
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,480
there's no point in them

627
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,159
uh trying to adopt it now um but

628
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,840
you know the hope is really to change

629
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,679
their minds uh

630
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,399
at some at some stage um

631
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,840
and make it so that multicast becomes

632
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,239
ubiquitous but we think there's going to

633
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,720
be

634
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,320
essentially an adoption curve no matter

635
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
how we slice it people are going to be

636
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,639
incrementally adopting this if it does

637
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,080
move forward but you know our goal

638
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,000
in in this work is to get uh is to end

639
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,279
up with ubiquitous deployment at some

640
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
point where

641
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,279
uh networks that that haven't got around

642
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,678
to it yet

643
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,480
uh are going to sort of be increasingly

644
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,840
realized

645
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,120
realizing that they're missing out on

646
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,000
something that's working for other

647
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,039
people

648
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,960
um that's kind of the the way i see this

649
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,559
playing out uh assuming we don't you

650
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,840
know hit a wall somewhere

651
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,840
um but the the

652
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
the issues that were cited that

653
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,600
that came up during the course of trying

654
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,679
to set these trials up

655
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,719
uh are listed here uh there there are

656
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
several different

657
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,960
cases um there's been some discussion of

658
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,679
that on the list thank you lenny i hope

659
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,600
that's

660
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,679
helped to clarify some of these issues

661
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,639
and i am aware i'll try to get that into

662
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,399
the draft if we

663
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,159
if we do anything uh with this draft

664
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,559
about amna so hopefully that's

665
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,919
reasonably clear about the problems that

666
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,080
i encountered

667
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,440
and one the the reason i went with mnat

668
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,678
is that i noticed that

669
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,559
all the problems that that i did

670
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,039
encounter

671
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,399
could be addressed by this one you know

672
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,640
by this one neat trick

673
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,080
of just putting my multicast traffic

674
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
into different addresses

675
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,799
into a different address space uh while

676
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,919
it's within the network that has some

677
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,320
special restrictions right so um

678
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,520
so that's really what drove the the work

679
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,960
on this

680
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,520
um the way that it works uh

681
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
is written up in in the draft i hope a

682
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
couple of people have gotten a chance to

683
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
read it

684
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,000
uh hopefully i'd be happy to take

685
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,919
comments and stuff

686
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,080
but the basic idea is that there's an

687
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,039
ingress and an egress

688
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
um at the ingress you translate into an

689
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,600
address space

690
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,399
that uh so you take the the external sg

691
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,918
and you translate it into a an address

692
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,879
space that works within the local

693
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,880
network

694
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,159
and that address space that works within

695
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,720
the local network

696
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,720
it might be

697
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,840
in general

698
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,479
uh of those groups that are local within

699
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,399
the network

700
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,159
is managed by an external service and

701
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,158
that service is essentially located

702
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,640
http api essentially and the egress

703
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,919
and the ingress are both talking to that

704
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,799
service

705
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,240
to find out what that mapping looks like

706
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,200
and then the ingress just

707
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,320
um you know at the ingress point there's

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,159
a translation

709
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,918
of because we know that that

710
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,840
within this network we have subscribers

711
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,360
to an external global

712
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,199
sg we're going to you know do something

713
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,320
to propagate the ingest of that traffic

714
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,159
into the network

715
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,600
and then we're going to change it into

716
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,919
the addresses that

717
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,959
that are appropriate for this uh for

718
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,120
this network

719
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,080
according to whatever the mnat service

720
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,199
told us

721
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,678
and likewise at the egress we're going

722
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
to be

723
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,399
taking information about we know that

724
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,039
there are clients that want to do a join

725
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,799
of the global sg i'm going to report

726
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:33,600
that to the mnat service

727
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,200
and ask them if there's a translation

728
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,760
that should be performed

729
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,640
and then we'll be signing up to receive

730
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
the

731
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,640
the locally mapped addresses that are

732
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,440
that are appropriate for within this

733
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,120
network

734
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,399
and then turn that back into the

735
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,760
the global sg before passing it on

736
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,080
and then one of the

737
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,679
neat tricks about this is that with an

738
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,000
http api

739
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,760
we could run the egress all the way in

740
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,679
the client app

741
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,919
itself or in the os for the client app

742
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,360
so that outside of the device it just

743
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,640
looks like the client is trying to

744
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,479
subscribe to

745
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,559
you know the the perhaps the star g that

746
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,039
makes sense for within this network

747
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,720
um but the client knows that subscribing

748
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
to that star g

749
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,840
uh what it really means is it's

750
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,959
referring to traffic that comes from the

751
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
global sg

752
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,000
and it can treat it accordingly and it

753
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
can do the things like like

754
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,240
the authentication with ambi that's

755
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,640
based on the the global sg

756
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,919
that is you know looked up in the global

757
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,960
sg

758
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
uh according to the the dns that comes

759
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,440
from the global source

760
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:45,200
um and apply those uh that

761
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,960
authentication for example to the

762
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,960
payloads that it's receiving

763
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,799
uh in the locally assigned uh star g

764
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
or or whatever it is that's that's been

765
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,000
locally assigned

766
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,760
um and one of the key uh reasons i'm

767
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,600
trying to do it this way i think there

768
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,440
might be a few other ways to approach it

769
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
but this seemed the simplest to me

770
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,360
um and one of the things that you get

771
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,879
out of this is that there's not

772
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,959
a an upgrade to the cbe devices which is

773
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,360
quite expensive for some of the isps

774
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,360
like in general they are willing to do

775
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,279
things that improve their efficiency

776
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,279
but they're not willing to do like a

777
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,000
major sort of uh

778
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,960
greenfield rollout right and which makes

779
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,200
perfect sense

780
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
it's in line with with how their

781
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
finances are

782
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,000
are run right so um by running something

783
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,519
potentially

784
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,480
as deep as inside the app you can really

785
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,279
dodge a lot of

786
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,399
um a lot of the need for new equipment

787
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,360
all you need to deploy

788
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,279
is a new service somewhere that's

789
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,678
discoverable within the network

790
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,840
and then that new service needs to be

791
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,039
standardized enough that you can

792
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,039
that you can communicate all the

793
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,120
signaling about what this translation

794
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,200
for the local network should be

795
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,320
the way i propose to do the discovery in

796
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,159
the draft is with dnssd

797
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,840
you can also do it by configuration

798
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,559
because sometimes the dumb access points

799
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,000
also

800
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,600
aren't going to be able to pass the

801
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,800
search domain that you need to use

802
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,679
the nssd um but that's the

803
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,440
the basic outline of what it's trying to

804
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,960
accomplish and why

805
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,320
um and

806
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,560
i guess so

807
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,919
i've got an early prototype i really

808
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,839
should say almost running

809
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,199
it's not doing the full end-to-end

810
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,359
translation yet

811
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,319
but it is doing most of the back and

812
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,639
forth signaling

813
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,760
it's using an updated yang model that's

814
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,240
different from what's in the draft but

815
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,359
i'll be

816
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,439
uh i'll be posting that soon i'll be

817
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,719
posting the code that goes with this

818
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,720
prototype implementation

819
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,480
and my real question is whether this uh

820
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,760
is suitable for

821
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,839
mbondi adoption and whether uh

822
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,359
the mbod participants think that we

823
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:57,839
should do so

824
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,359
there's one caveat about suitability

825
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,720
that maybe i should raise i looked at

826
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,000
the charter for mbud

827
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,799
and it did say that group management

828
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,119
protocols

829
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,800
are out of scope i'm not sure whether

830
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,119
this qualifies as a group management

831
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:17,839
protocol because the egress does report

832
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,839
to the central service

833
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,839
equipment

834
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,560
um but it's not passing that uh it's not

835
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,280
um replacing igmp in that the next hop

836
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,560
router

837
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,280
still gets told through igmp or or mld

838
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,200
uh about the group management for the

839
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,200
traffic within the local network

840
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,399
so um i think we're fully in the clear

841
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,799
here jake

842
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,400
uh okay great i mean because really

843
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,760
we're talking about is igmp we didn't

844
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,200
want to modify the stack if you look

845
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,599
historically where group

846
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,598
it was it was at the stack right so i

847
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,160
we're totally clear

848
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,079
okay so you know when you call it a

849
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,680
group management protocol i mean

850
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,960
there is some group management reporting

851
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,319
but it's doing it to a centralized

852
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,599
service so there's a little bit of a

853
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,000
difference there but i just wanted to

854
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,040
raise that

855
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,839
as a as a possible uh thing that he's

856
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,880
discussing

857
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,000
um but outside that i don't see any

858
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,359
reason that it's not

859
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,040
in scope for mbondi um and i hope it's

860
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,839
useful but i'd be willing to take

861
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,839
comments on that point

862
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,200
and that's all i got um it's it's not

863
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,560
modifying the

864
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,000
igmp or pim or mld right

865
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,799
nope nothing yeah

866
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,160
so i i i would say that it's and it's

867
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,720
not creating a new

868
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,640
group membership protocol uh it's really

869
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,480
just using those so

870
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,078
um and and and mapping

871
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,000
with those so i don't think that it

872
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,800
would be a uh

873
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,920
i agree with greg there i think this is

874
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,440
a great piece i mean

875
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,200
it's clearly part of the puzzle and the

876
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,400
feedback you got directly from operators

877
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,799
showing these the gaps and

878
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,480
you solve them with a single clever tool

879
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,839
is fantastic

880
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,960
um so i'm i i'd support adoption we need

881
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,119
to take it to the

882
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,520
list here or the room here right now

883
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,760
i'll try the tool see how this works

884
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,759
um

885
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,119
i'll call it mnap look at that start a

886
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,839
session

887
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,839
there it is raise your hand do not raise

888
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,720
your hand participants

889
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,200
that's huh uh raise your hand if you

890
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:40,399
think it should be adopted

891
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,399
do i get to vote on this yes you do

892
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:54,320
isn't that a cool tool

893
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,599
is raising the hand that the same as the

894
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,079
q join q no that's different so there's

895
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,599
the q

896
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,280
in the left but the next toolbar down

897
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:05,040
you've got the participant list you got

898
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,880
the chat g panel you've got a show of

899
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,800
hands tool oh chef handstand

900
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,720
all right got it all right i think we're

901
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,599
there 11 of 23 come in

902
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,118
we have no dissent uh all right we'll

903
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,440
take the list for adoption

904
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:24,000
thank you very much great thank you

905
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,000
uh that is it then so back to you guys

906
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,560
okay

907
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:36,640
all right next up is

908
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,000
yisha uh on the multicast redundancy

909
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,279
ingress

910
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,800
yeah can you hear me yes yes

911
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,240
uh should i share with my screen

912
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,000
or you can help me um

913
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,200
can you try yours okay

914
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
and if it doesn't work

915
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,119
i had it working with powerpoint slides

916
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,119
pdf

917
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:15,839
i have sent the request of the

918
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,839
shared screen

919
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:29,839
[Music]

920
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,839
i'm not seeing it yet

921
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,880
yeah it says you have to accept the

922
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,200
request but i'm not seeing the request

923
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,560
come through

924
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,680
are you seeing a request to to accept

925
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,520
i have said the request of yeah but

926
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,319
lenny do you see it i don't see it

927
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,920
i don't know where i haven't got it i

928
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,750
haven't seen it yet

929
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,400
it's in the q panel

930
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,800
[Music]

931
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,040
join q it's in the queue yeah

932
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,440
yeah i have said the screen requested in

933
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,440
the queue

934
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:11,599
oh up there gallery countdown take note

935
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:15,118
cleaning start in settings leave room

936
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,200
on top of the participant list uh

937
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,599
all right let me see if maybe i cannot

938
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,598
do this

939
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,319
ah you have to scroll to the top

940
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,200
participants list there it is

941
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,200
grant screen

942
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,240
that was probably the mistake we were

943
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,240
making before wait for that to come up

944
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,240
okay thank you

945
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,040
okay and we get it i love the recursive

946
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,160
view that pops up first that's

947
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,880
okay the um

948
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,319
yes we see them excellent go right ahead

949
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,680
okay okay

950
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,920
uh i'm miss liu from china mobile and uh

951
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,879
today i will represent the

952
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,560
multicast redundant uh ingress router

953
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,599
failover

954
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,759
this is the first presentation

955
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,960
of this chart firstly i will

956
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,240
introduce the concept of this uh draft

957
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,880
and the maticosa doma and the

958
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,000
ir and er and the the multicultural

959
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,400
domain means that

960
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
uh forward multicast flow according to

961
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,880
the specific

962
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,079
multicast technologies uh like uh pm

963
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,880
beer ptmp mpls etc

964
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,599
this domain may or may not connect the

965
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,720
multicast

966
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,440
source and the receiver directly and the

967
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,759
ir

968
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,200
means the ingress router and the er in

969
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,960
the egress editor

970
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,399
that it means that in the multicast

971
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,839
domain that

972
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,200
it may or may not connect the source or

973
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,799
receiver directly

974
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,960
but it's the most adjacent

975
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,520
router to the source of the receiver in

976
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,960
the multicast domain

977
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:08,800
the next uh i will introduce the

978
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:13,200
uh redundant ingress router failover

979
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:17,839
uh a multicast source uh connected

980
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,960
to irs uh in order to avoid the single

981
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,319
node

982
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,760
failure in this draft the single node

983
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,720
the the irs failure means that the ir

984
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,640
node failure

985
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:34,000
and the ir to er part failure

986
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,598
and the two irs are all uh umh

987
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,440
candidates for the

988
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,640
ers in case the ir who is in charge of

989
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,880
uh

990
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:48,560
forwarding flows or uh

991
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,200
it when it fails all the parts from the

992
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,400
ir

993
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,680
to the er fails and

994
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,319
it can cannot be recovered and the

995
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,359
forwarding ir is switched over lack of

996
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,440
ir2 to the r1 to r2

997
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:08,560
and for different multicast technologies

998
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,440
like pim or beer or ptmp mpls and

999
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,960
different

1000
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:17,920
functions used to build the

1001
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,920
a tree or a sub tree or to uh

1002
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,480
to to build a tree uh wholly or

1003
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,000
partially

1004
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,280
next here is the example and the ir1

1005
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,040
is a sr sr means the selected ir

1006
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,400
and ir1

1007
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:44,079
and rx are the keynotes

1008
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,800
keynote means that one uh ir1 and the ir

1009
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
x

1010
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,440
rx sales there is no any other

1011
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,000
parts between the ir1 to the ers and the

1012
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,680
er

1013
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,760
e1 r2 three it's the keynotes

1014
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,118
to the r1 for all of the uh ers

1015
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:07,119
and uh like pim or uh uh

1016
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:10,480
rm and iron can choose

1017
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,960
uh the iry as the upstream node

1018
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,839
to send a drawing message and to build a

1019
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,200
new tree

1020
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:20,400
uh which uh which rooted at the ir2

1021
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,040
and the same as the mrdp it can can send

1022
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,079
the

1023
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,119
label mapping message

1024
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,560
and for the beer the r2

1025
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,079
should forward the to the ers

1026
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,560
uh to encapsulate the the

1027
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:41,680
b string for the

1028
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:45,680
p2mp rsvpte

1029
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,680
it should be rebuild the

1030
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,359
rsp or the sub-rsp to replace the old

1031
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,560
one

1032
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,560
from the r1

1033
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,560
and we we have three types of the

1034
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,640
standby modes

1035
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,200
the first is the code standby cosine y

1036
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,200
means that

1037
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:11,598
uh er selects a ir

1038
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,359
as the selected ir is there and the

1039
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,400
signals to the

1040
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,759
sir to get the automatic flow

1041
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,720
when the er fans sr

1042
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,000
is done all the parts is broken and the

1043
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,359
er signals the

1044
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:30,560
bar the backup ir

1045
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,078
that's the code standby uh the mode this

1046
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,119
is the second mode is the

1047
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:39,040
uh warm standby whoops means that the er

1048
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:42,319
signals both the error and the

1049
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:46,640
the slr forwards the flow to the er

1050
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:50,400
and the bir must not forward the flow

1051
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,759
unless the sr fails

1052
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,359
and the the third mode is the hosting by

1053
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,319
houston by means that

1054
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,359
er signals both the irs both ir send the

1055
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,480
flow

1056
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:06,480
to the er and the er must

1057
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,040
discard the duplicated flow

1058
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,160
and in this situation ir does not

1059
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,359
distinguish

1060
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:17,759
the sr or bro

1061
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,000
uh for the three type of the mode we can

1062
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,560
have a compilation of that

1063
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:28,000
uh the first is the iro

1064
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,759
uh for the code standby the iron

1065
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,760
forward the flow according to the

1066
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,960
request from the er

1067
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,319
and for the worm standby it will

1068
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:42,400
take the role of slr or blr

1069
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:45,920
and also the bir must not

1070
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:50,160
forward flow to the ir until the

1071
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,119
sr fails and in the host and by

1072
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,440
the ir need not to know the roles of the

1073
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,640
sr obr

1074
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,680
it's both a forwarding flow

1075
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,960
according to the request of firm er

1076
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:08,000
for the er for the ero for the ero

1077
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,520
in code standby it must

1078
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,040
select an ars sr to signal the

1079
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:19,040
flow request and

1080
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,440
it it also signal to the br to request

1081
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,279
the flow when the sr fails

1082
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:28,720
and in warm standby mode the er does not

1083
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,319
select the sro blr just a signal to both

1084
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,279
of them

1085
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:33,839
uh and in a hot standby it will discard

1086
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,040
the

1087
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:40,799
duplicate flow from fbr until

1088
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,920
the slr fails and for the regular router

1089
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,920
in the multicultural domain

1090
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,040
it doesn't need to know about the sr or

1091
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,078
bir

1092
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,720
for the same role so scene router

1093
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,359
uh the code standby and the warm standby

1094
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,959
mode

1095
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:02,160
no duplicated flow is forwarded and

1096
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,599
maybe uh in some

1097
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,558
situation uh duplicated flow may maybe

1098
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,559
forwarded in the

1099
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:16,079
same router and

1100
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,119
we have uh some uh consideration

1101
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:22,240
about the three types of the mode

1102
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:25,359
and that is the coder standby

1103
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,240
is the easiest way to implement it

1104
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,440
but it will take the longest to watch

1105
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,919
time

1106
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,800
in warm standby everything will take the

1107
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,440
middle

1108
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,720
packet loss and convert time but it's

1109
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,240
hard for the

1110
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,359
bir to know the failure between the

1111
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:46,799
isr and the ers it means that

1112
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,640
it's a little bit difficult for the

1113
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:54,000
br to know the parts from the ir slr to

1114
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,879
a er and for the house done by

1115
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
it will take the most last packet loss

1116
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,400
but

1117
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,200
uh the duplicated backhand forwarding in

1118
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,640
the dorman

1119
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,640
so more bandwide occupied

1120
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,078
the next step we will uh welcome to

1121
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,040
more comments or questions

1122
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,040
thanks that's all

1123
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:37,040
hello great so uh yes

1124
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:39,359
jake talk um

1125
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,480
all right thank you for writing this up

1126
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,680
uh i think it's

1127
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,240
it's kind of interesting but i'm a

1128
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,759
little confused like what is the

1129
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:51,200
goal for this document like

1130
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,839
it almost seems like it wants to be a

1131
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,118
bcp

1132
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,599
but it's informational

1133
00:49:55,119 --> 00:50:00,319
and just sort of covers what people do

1134
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,319
is that the idea

1135
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:06,400
uh it's it's it's provided

1136
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,279
a general consideration for the

1137
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:11,119
multicast

1138
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,720
uh ingress router failover uh

1139
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:18,079
can uh a diplomat and uh

1140
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,118
uh here here in the draft uh which

1141
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,079
which mode which mode uh the the the

1142
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,440
network

1143
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:28,880
uh uh should take

1144
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,200
and we think that it depends on the

1145
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,160
specific network deployment and it

1146
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:37,919
depends on the

1147
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,920
uh choice of the network administrator

1148
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,079
all right i guess um i i did read this

1149
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,200
document and i was

1150
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,880
uh trying to figure out like if you're

1151
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,480
running pim can you do anything besides

1152
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,880
a cold failover or is this

1153
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,760
like how does that you know there were

1154
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,359
some

1155
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,040
assumptions i did not follow about the

1156
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,920
way the signaling would work

1157
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,558
i guess and i'm i'm not sure if the plan

1158
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,319
is to clarify that or you're looking for

1159
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:08,720
uh feedback on the list about the

1160
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:11,119
uh about the doc or like

1161
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,240
what is that i i'm not sure where the

1162
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,559
stock is

1163
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,078
going like who's the who's the main

1164
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,839
audience and what are they

1165
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:23,839
intended to do with it i guess okay

1166
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,839
okay

1167
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,480
yeah we're out of time um we would love

1168
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,759
to

1169
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,440
talk more but unfortunately we have uh

1170
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,920
we have two more presentations in nine

1171
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,359
minutes and uh

1172
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,359
they cut things off so if we could take

1173
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:43,440
this to the list um are you

1174
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,480
you sean are you i assume you're you're

1175
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,000
seeking um

1176
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,520
working group uh adoption

1177
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,880

the multicast young data mode update

1200
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,319
from the draft we know that there's no

1201
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:28,480
significant

1202
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:31,599
modification version 0 0 to 002

1203
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,880
and in the update of the version 0

1204
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:38,960
3 and 0.4 we made

1205
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,280
big changes but the main

1206
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,319
modification is about the editorial

1207
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,079
modification

1208
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:50,480
according to fc8407

1209
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:54,839
and we add more description in the model

1210
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,240
to helpful the reader understanding the

1211
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,599
model

1212
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:03,680
okay this is the major update of the

1213
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,720
chapter and the later is

1214
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,759
wanted to recall some memory or

1215
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,279
attention on this structure

1216
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:17,200
the time limit we i wanted to

1217
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:21,520
present this content but you can read it

1218
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:24,399
from it okay that's all

1219
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,200
thanks we'd like to request more

1220
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,400
comments

1221
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:31,598
and the reviews before walking ghouls of

1222
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,920
king group last call

1223
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,920
thanks

1224
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,200
so so sandy this had previously gone to

1225
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,440
um

1226
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,799
uh the yang doctor yang doctor review

1227
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,000
right and there was

1228
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:48,880
feedback uh and i assume you've updated

1229
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,319
it

1230
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:55,200
based on that feedback yes i had

1231
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,160
done the modification according to the

1232
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,520
young doctors

1233
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,960
review but i think they will

1234
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,960
they need to review it again because

1235
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,960
different young doctors may have

1236
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,799
different

1237
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,280
suggestions on it so maybe i can need

1238
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:16,559
more

1239
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,559
require review and comments

1240
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:26,319
um because one distractor goes into

1241
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,000
open group last call the young doctor

1242
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:31,359
will review it again

1243
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,839
so before that i i'd like

1244
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,960
more people to view it and give us

1245
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,319
comments about

1246
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:41,760
the model itself and the young doctor

1247
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:45,200
will give me the program suggestion

1248
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,400
for the structure or some

1249
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:51,759
programmer something else

1250
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,920
yes so we'd like to

1251
00:55:51,760 --> 00:56:03,760
make this structure uh technology and

1252
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:08,559
the grammar is all good for us yeah

1253
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,640
jake this is jake again um

1254
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,760
if i remember right from the discussion

1255
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,960
this uh

1256
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,760
this document is already in production

1257
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,359
and deployed

1258
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,440
in a number of places right are there

1259
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:23,440
any reports from

1260
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:27,200
uh from them uh where it's deployed

1261
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,720
or implementations uh

1262
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:34,160
where it's in youth we have the

1263
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:37,279
implementation for it and this project

1264
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,558
is open for everyone and because it's in

1265
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,960
open daylight and in our

1266
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:48,079
controller product it can also be used

1267
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,359
to manage the multicultural service

1268
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:54,559
yeah so but we know that

1269
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:57,920
they are only partial of the

1270
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,880
only part of the drug model has been

1271
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,079
verified

1272
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,000
and maybe some uh late

1273
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:09,200
uh some some part of the uh

1274
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,559
young model has not been verified so we

1275
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:14,558
would like more review on it yeah

1276
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,839
can you identify which parts are which

1277
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,880
like which parts are like

1278
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:21,680
really uh could you maybe send something

1279
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,680
about that to the list like sort of

1280
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:27,359
which parts have been exercised in

1281
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,960
you know in production or by uh

1282
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,640
the way it's used in products

1283
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:35,839
extensively and which parts really need

1284
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:39,118
more uh digging or more uh examination

1285
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:42,799
and so yes because you see the

1286
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:46,559
this there's many parts parts in

1287
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:49,440
this model and some we know that

1288
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,160
there's many options for the multicast

1289
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,599
deployment

1290
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,040
such as overlay your vlc european

1291
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,839
european bdp

1292
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:59,520
or something else and in transporter we

1293
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:03,040
may choose beer ping

1294
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,160
or other things so we

1295
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,440
needn't define the detail of this model

1296
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,720
because this model has

1297
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:14,079
a mature model here we just

1298
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,359
like to organize

1299
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:20,799
them and make them

1300
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:23,680
mix them together to help the

1301
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,640
multicultural service deploy but

1302
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:29,200
something

1303
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:32,960
in some parts of the draft we made some

1304
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,640
such as backup tunnels or something else

1305
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:40,240
because when uh we talk the

1306
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:44,000
issue with our customers they think it's

1307
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:47,520
important so i also added them

1308
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
into the uh model so we'd like

1309
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,799
more review on it if you think it's

1310
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,079
reasonable

1311
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:57,359
or available and it's

1312
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,160
good for us yeah okay thanks

1313
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,960
all right so unfortunately we don't have

1314
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,279
any more

1315
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,240
time uh but just please um sandy take it

1316
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,599
to the list uh

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,279
and um get folks to uh

1318
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,880

1319
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,599
um you know

1320

1331
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,960
minutes uh grace period

1335
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,200
take it to the end to see if we really

1336
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:10,799
do get kicked off five minutes after

1337
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,960
i never got that question answered but

1338
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:15,920

ippm working group ip performance

1345
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,759
measurement

1346
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:37,280
working group because it

1347
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,960
it is calling for some modifications

1348
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,960
to some protocols

1349
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,079
and as what happened we we discussed

1350
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,520
this briefly with warren

1351
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,160
and as what happens oftentimes with oam

1352
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,960
related

1353
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,680
documents especially when it's multicast

1354
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,839
related is

1355
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,839
that there's there's not much interest

1356
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,520
or understanding of multicast related

1357
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,920
technology so

1358
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,440
it just kind of gets ignored and that's

1359
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,119
kind of where we are with

1360
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:12,799
this draft and so we our new strategy

1361
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:15,520
is to um revisit it with an mbondi

1362
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:17,520
as well as pim and we're kind of

1363
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,400
thinking now if i can just skip to ahead

1364
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,000
real quick

1365
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,640
this is the very last slide then i'll go

1366
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,440
back if if we don't get cut off is

1367
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,240
that um we are looking for adoption in

1368
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,880
mbondi

1369
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,759
uh it may be better in the ops area

1370
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,280
working group

1371
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,839
they don't know much about multicast so

1372
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:36,000
it may be difficult there

1373
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:37,119
so what we are thinking about doing and

1374
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,040
we did discuss this

1375
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,480
when we presented this last time in mod

1376
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,440
is to have a more

1377
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,480
general problem statement exist in mbo

1378
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,680
and d

1379
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:51,280
having to do with oam and multicast

1380
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:54,240
and then have the proposed protocol

1381
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,520
modifications done in pin since

1382
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,520
as far as i know that's not something

1383
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:00,799
that we do in mbondi so that's

1384
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,038
kind of our strategy right now um

1385
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:04,880
and so that's why we're here and how you

1386
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,960
and greg are both on the call they

1387
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,480
understand ippm related protocol

1388
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,000
especially iom and

1389
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,440
other protocols very well and so

1390
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,920
of course multi you know monitoring

1391
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,559
multicast traffic is is important

1392
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,000
uh it's it's helpful to be able to

1393
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:23,760
reconstruct and then visualize

1394
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,599
that multicast tree using telemetry data

1395
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,000
and being able to monitor the

1396
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,400
performance troubleshoot

1397
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,640
find out where jitter is where drops

1398
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,039
were occurring

1399
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,799
and things like that and so conventional

1400
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,680
oem techniques are not

1401
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:42,480
sufficient and there are some good on

1402
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,520
path telemetry techniques

1403
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,920
such as i om and

1404
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,119
post guard base tree and hybrid two-step

1405
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,920
that's being

1406
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,200
done in ippm and again how you and greg

1407
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,400
are leading some of those

1408
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:59,439
that protocol work and what

1409
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,839
the iom anyway has to do specifically

1410
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,000
with

1411
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,599
is adding telemetry data to the packet

1412
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,200
itself instead of doing an

1413
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:10,240
out-of-band mechanism for

1414
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,640
telemetry data operational data

1415
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:13,598
it's it's put in the packet itself and

1416
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,640
so

1417
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,480
you get real-time

1418
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:20,720
information and you can send that

1419
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:23,839
information where you want to do some

1420
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:25,520
analysis on it but the the current

1421
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,599
on-path telemetry techniques do have

1422
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:31,280
some flaws for multicast

1423
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:34,319
with iom every packet can

1424
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,280
cont carries the entire data trace

1425
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:38,558
and so there's a lot of um redundant

1426
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,079
data

1427
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:45,039
that occurs when you uh have entire

1428
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,760
paths multiple paths from end to end

1429
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,280
that are being

1430
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,480
um captured and sent to

1431
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,039
um telemetry um engines

1432
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,640
and so that's there's there's got to be

1433
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,520
some good ways and we've proposed some

1434
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,038
to

1435
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,319
to make it so that there isn't that

1436
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,599
redundancy at wasting bandwidth

1437
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:06,000
particularly when you're adding

1438
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:09,039
additional fields to

1439
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,480
packets which is what you do with

1440
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:16,240
iom and then with something like a

1441
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:18,079
postcard based type tree um

1442
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,279
there's no branch identifier so when

1443
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,440
you're correlating these

1444
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,559
postcards and postcards i'll show you in

1445
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,760
just a second here

1446
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:29,920
um when you

1447
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:32,000
correlate them um there's no way to tell

1448
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,039
uh when you're quoting where the

1449
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,319
branches uh

1450
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,880
exist and so we are again the objective

1451
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:39,359
is to

1452
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,280
to propose some modifications to allow

1453
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,759
the tree to be correctly reconstructed

1454
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,760
without

1455
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:46,160
unnecessary replication of telemetry

1456
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:49,359
information

1457
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:51,038
and so um just very quickly

1458
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,960
because we're going to just discuss this

1459
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,039
in pin and just the next

1460
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,160
meeting is there's there's a couple

1461
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,640
solutions one is

1462
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,920
um if you see in the bottom there's um

1463
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,960
we're proposing a branch

1464
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,799
identifier um each branch adds a branch

1465
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,000
identifier to the instruction header

1466
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:10,880
and so that you're able to when you're

1467
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,559
sending that data you're able to

1468
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,440
identify the branch points and then you

1469
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:19,760
can properly reconstruct the tree

1470
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,760
and then you can also do so when you

1471
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,960
correlate the data and can the data

1472
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,319
contains the entire section and then you

1473
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,160
send the data up to a

1474
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:33,119
um to when you're correlating that data

1475
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,319
um there's these are two examples of

1476
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,880
ways that you can

1477
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,640
capture and correlate uh there's other

1478
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,960
ways to do so as well and we we

1479
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:43,598
mentioned those in the draft

1480
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,039
um so i i mentioned this at the end at

1481
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,359
the beginning and this is at the end and

1482
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:47,039
just

1483
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:49,520
if we have time just wanted to see what

1484
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,680
people thought about

1485
01:05:49,520 --> 01:06:05,839
we're proposing and if this is the right

1486
01:05:51,680 --> 01:06:05,839
strategy to have

1487
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:19,839
any comments from anyone or any

1488
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:19,839
questions sorry

1489
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,079
i'll i mean this does seem valuable my

1490
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,960
only question is like

1491
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,920
uh is you know what's ipp i'm gonna

1492
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,880
think

1493
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,520
i guess yeah that's a that's a good

1494
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,960
question

1495
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:50,160
and um it's kind of similar situation

1496
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,760
to us uh point-to-multi-point drafts

1497
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:53,759
happening in spring and we've brought

1498
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:55,520
this into pym

1499
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,200
the pym chairs worked with the spring

1500
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,720
chairs and they said yeah please pim

1501
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:01,279
take it we don't have the time or

1502
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:03,839
interest or expertise to deal with it

1503
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:05,440
and so we did

1504
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:07,680
i'm anticipating something similar

1505
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,599
happening here um

1506
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,759
so this will be adopted in pim you think

1507
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,359
um well that's yet to be determined but

1508
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,359
um i think ideally

1509
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,799
in my mind we would have a problem

1510
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:22,319
statement draft being done

1511
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:24,079
here in mbondi it's operational related

1512
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:25,920
just and it will cover some of the

1513
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,799
things we mentioned here and then

1514
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,039
the protocol modifications being done in

1515
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,038
pym

1516
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,039
that sounds reasonable to me sure

1517
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,960
yeah you know

1518
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:47,279
sorry yeah it seems reasonable to uh

1519
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,799
do this here uh are you saying that it's

1520
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,079
going to be a different draft will be a

1521
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:52,240
problem statement

1522
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,359
uh yeah take this draft and turn it into

1523
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,919
a protocol

1524
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,640
uh draft and a problem statement draft i

1525
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,079
think so

1526
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:03,920
i think that's uh i think that's

1527
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:05,920
i think that's the case yeah so

1528
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:07,680
um we'll we'll see what happens in pim

1529
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,200
but i think uh that would make the

1530
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,839
most sense to me we would turn this one

1531
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,839
draft into two

1532
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,080
you also get confirmation of that in

1533
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,080
ippm or

1534
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,439
like yeah i think what we'll do and

1535
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,759
again i'm just

1536
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,599
using the example we did with the spring

1537
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:29,439
and point of multiplying is we would

1538
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,960
kind of discuss this and right we're

1539
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,799
doing it so right now we'll discuss in a

1540
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,359
pim and then we'll

1541
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:36,479
ping the ippm chairs and tell them

1542
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:38,000
what's going on and

1543
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,519
this is what we prefer to do and if they

1544
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
agree then we'll do it

1545
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,319
if the working group decides to bring on

1546
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,319
the work

1547
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:53,359
so i don't really have an action for you

1548
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,279
right now lenny and greg i just

1549
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,960
want to give you maybe a heads up and

1550
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:58,159
when you see an email coming your way

1551
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,439
then you'll know what the heck i'm

1552
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,599

1553

excellent thank you i think we're all

1554

01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:14,800
it's fuller than i expected though for

1579
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:18,239
the middle of the night

1580
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:20,480
that's true uh we do have somebody at

1581
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:20,480
the mic

1582
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,000

1584
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,400
haven't hear it clearly

1585
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,639
it's magic it happens automatic because

right so

1591
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,800
when i think we should just shut this

1592
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:52,080
down um rather than just wait for it to

1593
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,159
kill us because they do need resources

1594
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,760
sounds good all right thanks everybody

1595
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,839
