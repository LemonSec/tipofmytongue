1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,440
well by now

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,360
i'll be very surprised

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,119
but of course we are operating under

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,400
this note well welcome to the extra

5
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,240
session

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,439
at ihf 109 virtually in bangkok

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,519
we have a couple of

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
submitted documents that i'd like to

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,439
just do a status check on

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,280
and then we have three work items to

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,800
talk about and we'll finish by reviewing

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,360
our milestones

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
so looking across at those couple of

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,960
documents

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,000
braun can i yes quickly interrupt you uh

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,160
who's taking notes uh i'll probably take

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,160
notes actually

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,640
i have the session open to do that

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,639
all right then

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,519
just want to make sure that nothing is

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,920
lost

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
yep thank you

23
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,720
so we want to look at the

24
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,159
documents

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,080
so we have fetch preview and sieve

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,080
mailbox id that are both

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,720
sitting uh submitted for publication

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,679
and in area director follow-up so barry

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
if you

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,000
are available to to talk to what's

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
happening there that would be great

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,640
i know it's civ mailbox id the the most

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,000
recent thing on that

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:49,759
yep go ahead which one the fetch preview

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,439
um okay i mean i guess what's

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,520
status of that is i need to go look at

37
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,880
it so yeah let me do

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,798
while we're having this meeting and i'll

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
get back to you cool

40
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,520
yeah i think that fetch preview is

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,119
pretty much ready to go the big

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,439
discussion point was

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,040
civ mailbox id was how to deal with the

44
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,478
case where you specified

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,680
a mailbox id and a

46
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,840
special use in the same document

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,200
um so in that case right

48
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,440
what i said to do in there was

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
to resolve mailbox id first because it

50
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,720
is the most explicit and exact thing

51
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,399
um right then to go go and follow the

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,319
special use process which includes

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
creating a new mailbox with that special

54
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,399
use if it doesn't exist

55
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,160
but it's it's basically binding the

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,239
mailbox i do most tightly

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,519
which i think does actually also make

58
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,800
most sense because it's the most

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
explicit

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
thing but it's very unlikely that

61
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,760
anybody would ever specify both

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
well and that's that's really my

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,160
question that um

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,920
it doesn't make sense to me to specify

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,680
both and it would make me happier

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,280
although i'm not going to hold out

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,720
on this one too long but i wanted to

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,040
have the discussion

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,480
it it would make more sense to me to say

70
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,519
that they that you can't put them

71
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,119
together

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
because in the one case you're looking

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,599
for a specific mailbox

74
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,679
by id and in the other case you're

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,959
looking for a function

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,319
and yeah put them both in the same

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
command yeah i guess the the question is

78
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,879
whether

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040
the the answer there should be don't do

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,280
it and it's not allowed or don't do it

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
but if it does happen then then here's

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,120
how it works

83
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
i would prefer to say don't do it it's

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,799
not allowed but as i said

85
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,400
i'm not going to hold out on it once we

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,879
have the discussion

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
does anyone though i guess what i'd like

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,480
to ask is does anyone have a use case

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,560
where it actually makes sense

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
to specify both including a use case

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
where

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,200
you want to be tolerant of certain

93
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,079
errors and and it makes sense to do that

94
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,839
which i don't see it but if you

95
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
if someone wants to speak up for that

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
please

97
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
so what is the semantic of this going to

98
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,519
be do you have to

99
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,238
it has to be both have the id and

100
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,798
the special use no no it's the other way

101
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,719
around

102
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,198
the idea is that if you're using mailbox

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
id

104
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,479
it doesn't make sense to put special use

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
on also

106
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,520
and if you're using special use it

107
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,479
doesn't make sense to put

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,680
mailbox id on there and they're

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,240
completely different

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
things that won't work together now i

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,400
understand i was just trying to

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
uh think of if we are to leave the

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,159
combined

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,520
allow the combination of the two what

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,720
the semantic is going to be

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,560
ah the semantics would be that

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,479
if the mailbox id exists then you use it

118
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
otherwise you fall back to the special

119
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,198
use

120
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
yeah and the the most complex thing was

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
was this example here where there's

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
create as well

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,400
in which case if nothing existed it

124
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
would create a new mailbox with the

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
archive special use but it would not get

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
the same mailbox id

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,919
and and that specific one sounds like it

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,240
really would be an implementation

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,680
issue uh it would complicate

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
implementations

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
i mean you you have to check for the

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
mailbox id existing

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,758
then you have to check for the special

134
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
use existing and then you decide whether

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,960
you're going to create something

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
but what you create i guess would have

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
the

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,639
um the special use attached to it but

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,638
would be a different mailbox id

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,039
it it all seemed to have the same name

141
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,880
it seems much better to me to say that

142
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,400
it does not make sense to put them both

143
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,400
together and it's an error if you do

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,360
i'm happy to do that as well i think uh

145
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,160
i can't think of a reasonable case where

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
you would have to have both um i guess

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
it's a nice

148
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
fallback in in the case where that

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
mailbox gets deleted

150
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
that it would get recreated with the

151
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
special use but if

152
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,638
it gets deleted and then something

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
creates something with that special use

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,759
already then it will

155
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,119
file into there without having to create

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,319
a new one

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
and this is i'm thinking kind of on my

158
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
feet here

159
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,520
but the example i'm thinking of is that

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,360
you had to file into with the specific

161
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,840
mailbox id defined just because your

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,319
system

163
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,080
automatically does that but you also say

164
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,840
that the purpose is

165
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,120
as ascent folder and then

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,119
you might want to tie other things that

167
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,639
mailbox id in your sieve management

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
system as well

169
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,919
and then if someone went ahead and

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,000
deleted that mailbox and then

171
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,440
another client created a new mailbox

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,720
with that special use

173
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,240
you wouldn't necessarily want to go

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,280
ahead and create it yourself in your

175
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
script because

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
it had been created by another client in

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,160
the meantime

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
and and what if you cross the

179
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,759
international date line i mean you know

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,520
it starts i mean the answer there is to

181
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,120
make your sieve generation script not

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,560
use the mailbox id if it's

183
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,919
right for a file into my use um

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
let's see what ken has to say it's going

185
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,880
to work your way i i think i'm leaning

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,880
towards

187
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
very suggestion of making them mutually

188
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
exclusive and they cannot be used

189
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
together

190
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,639
especially in light of the fact that we

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,719
have a test for both

192
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
if the mailbox id exists and a special

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,039
use exists so

194
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,440
you can write a script that will handle

195
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,960
both cases just by using the tests

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,199
as opposed to having everything jammed

197
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,198
into one action

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,039
all right i will go ahead all right i

199
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:45,039
think

200
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:47,039
just say that okay thanks

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,560
cool done and you're going to read

202
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,440
through fetch preview which means we're

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,520
now on to the next item in our agenda

204
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,360
which is imap4 rev2

205
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,960
alexa you're welcome to share slides

206
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,160
yourself if you want or i can manage

207
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,799
them for you

208
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
um if you manage them for me that would

209
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:12,240
be

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:13,919
great thank you cool

211
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
so we do have murray here so that's

212
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,198
great um

213
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,560
right um quick update and the war

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,879
uh i think there were like three

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,560
revisions since

216
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:31,520
july um finishing

217
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,159
um yeah move to the next slide um

218
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,640
finishing comments from stefan uh as

219
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,640
well as

220
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:43,598
um catching few other remaining things

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,320
like list of recommended extensions and

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
stuff

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
um next slide please

224
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,839
that's right there you go

225
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,760
yeah so um on pointed out that

226
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,839
the text in the at the front of the

227
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,720
document was still talking about sort of

228
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,959
um changes in rfc

229
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,360
3501 which is previous version so needed

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,359
to be adjusted

231
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
i didn't quite go all the way with on

232
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,200
suggestions to list

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
everything that changed but um i think i

234
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
added enough pointers so hopefully this

235
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,399
is clear

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,399
um a few clarifications

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,560
um i've noticed that star tls

238
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,519
description

239
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,239
command description was uh saying that

240
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
it can

241
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
return bad if command is not recognized

242
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,519
well

243
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
how can it be not recognized if it's

244
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,600
here so that sort of

245
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,240
sounded like a silly case but um there

246
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,320
is a more useful one which is

247
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
if somebody issues 30 ls when tls is

248
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,720
already

249
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,519
active whether just repeated start tls

250
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,279
or on

251
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,560
telesport so this now is clear that this

252
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:08,000
returns bad

253
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
um we had several

254
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
there were several remaining issues from

255
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,160
um

256
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,680
last atf um about making sure that list

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,319
responses are mandatory for selected

258
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,319
and examine

259
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,800
so uh this is fixed and examples were

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,880
updated if people can send you check

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,640
examples that would be great um

262
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,360
some clarification there was some old

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,760
text about uid and x and ud validity

264
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
about

265
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,680
what the behavior is if they're not

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
there at the same time they are

267
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,479
mandatory

268
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,040
elsewhere in the text so it's it wasn't

269
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,800
entirely consistent so i think

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
yeah i basically deleted the old

271
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
text

272
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:06,959
and we also uh added some text about

273
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,880
how um mailbox canonicalization

274
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,199
whether it's due to normalization or

275
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,880
some other kind of mapping rules

276
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,720
can be done and how this is written

277
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,680
returning list responses

278
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
for when mailboxes get deleted when

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,560
mailboxes get renamed

280
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,200
like uh to specify that client

281
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,518
issued this name but now new name is you

282
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,800
know something else

283
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,839
um so please text about that

284
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,680
i think that's all changes oh actually

285
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:43,279
no i think there is another slide um

286
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:46,399
next slide please

287
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,560
yes um there are there are uh there were

288
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,880
a few more things we had discussion last

289
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,040
uh

290
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,120
itf that uh whether to clarify that

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,639
each you search with the currently

292
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,720
specified

293
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:06,480
options like mean man max count and all

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,079
uh whether it allowed to return multiple

295
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,880
research responses that have to be

296
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,279
amalgamated and now the document says

297
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,519
that

298
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,959
that's not allowed you can write an

299
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,920
extension which allows for that but

300
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,119
you'll need to specify this explicitly

301
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,079
um some editorial changes um

302
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,600
moving section specification into a new

303
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,638
subsection

304
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,360
of and um

305
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
referencing it elsewhere in the text

306
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,439
um there were several comments from

307
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,518
stefan about um

308
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,959
like for well-formed messages it's clear

309
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,399
what the date should be

310
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,199
what uh you know

311
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,200
in in envelope um and various other

312
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,560
places um

313
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,639
so there is now more clarity about how

314
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,199
this kind of football formed or draft

315
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,880
messages

316
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,839
so like when you wrote an empty strings

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,839
when you return nails and stuff like

318
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
that

319
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,720
next

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:20,079
now there is a reference to tls 1.3

321
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:24,800
um the text is worded such that

322
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,800
both are allowed in use um

323
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:32,079
tls 1.3 is recommended but uh

324
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:35,680
tls 1.2 is still loud um which i think

325
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
is very similar to recommendations

326
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,800
coming from

327
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,800
tls working groups anyway um

328
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,800
i cleaned up appendix d um they were

329
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,800
like

330
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,599
i was supposed to list all the pending

331
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,880
changes as well as changes made sense

332
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,279
i rationalized that i think i removed

333
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,320
everything that was done now because

334
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,839
we're really late in in the process and

335
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
there shouldn't be any open issues about

336
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,240
that

337
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
and then there is a new section about

338
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,639
recommended extensions

339
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,839
um i'll revisit this very quickly today

340
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,839
just to make sure that people are

341
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,639
comfortable

342
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,120
for now it it mentioned quicker sync on

343
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,720
store and object id but

344
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,279
we can discuss if people want to add

345
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:31,839
something else

346
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,839
next slide please

347
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,479
right um i was checking my notes and i

348
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,680
was like i thought i i did

349
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,600
everything and then i found out that uh

350
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,279
there was some changes in relationship

351
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,720
to supporting

352
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,720
64-bit message sizes

353
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,279
um i forgot to do this change

354
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,639
i think i still i or somebody or chairs

355
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,959
should probably still double check on

356
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,720
the main english that people are happy

357
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,800
to go with this because this

358
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
your servers don't have to support this

359
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,079
but the clients always have to support

360
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
this because they they have to

361
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,959
accommodate

362
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,439
bigger message sizes basically orbit bar

363
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,439
sizes

364
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,360
that shouldn't take very long um i

365
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,759
had a separate draft on this

366
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,519
which was parked few years back so uh

367
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,920
this is mostly just debian f

368
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,839
fixes to allow for bigger sizes

369
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,959
if you have opinions one way or the

370
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,560
other

371
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,959
please shout um i

372
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,599
double checked with teemo see ryan and

373
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,599
yesterday

374
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,079
he said that he served already support

375
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,320
64-bit

376
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,479
message and body part sizes so he will

377
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,560
be quite happy with this change

378
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,920
and from notes from our previous meeting

379
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,599
i think braun was happy

380
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,599
with this as well um but if somebody

381
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,720
really doesn't like it please let me

382
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,800
know

383
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,399
yeah the only challenge with it is what

384
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,560
happens if you have a message in your

385
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,839
store which is more than 32 bits

386
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,758
and a non-imap4rev2 client connects

387
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,519
does it get a truncated version does the

388
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,480
message not appear to it

389
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,079
um and how does that work and we haven't

390
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,079
solved this problem

391
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,758
no um particular trick is if you connect

392
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,239
us an imap

393
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,240
for rev1 do some queries decide to

394
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,240
upgrade to imac 4 rev 2 and suddenly

395
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,519
uids appear that were not present as

396
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,120
rev1

397
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,560
so it does mean that you need to treat

398
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
rev1 and rev2

399
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,560
as completely separate for caching

400
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,399
message id number

401
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,560
purposes if you're going to have

402
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
messages that disappear and reappear

403
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,839
depending which mode you're in

404
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,279
this is going to be very tricky to be

405
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,959
honest

406
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,600
i said i mean the the main thing is to

407
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,920
say either always use it for f2 or never

408
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,640
use i'm at 402 with the same server

409
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,639
don't mix them

410
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,079
yes which is probably a good good advice

411
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
anyway um

412
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,959
yeah so it might be worth putting

413
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,079
specific suggestion for that in the text

414
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,919
clients should not on pain of

415
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,959
confusion mix the two

416
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,799
because they'll be in there we'll make

417
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,799
sure this is in the notes please

418
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,879
so that we don't forget um and

419
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
i i think yeah we might need to discuss

420
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,919
the whole concept of hiding some

421
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,120
messages which are too big

422
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,120
to be exposed uh how this is going to

423
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
work

424
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,160
um however irrespective of this question

425
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,200
i think the document

426
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,799
as far as our

427
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,400
responsible id is concerned

428
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,360
i think murray can just review the

429
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,360
document as is

430
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
once this is implemented this will be a

431
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,199
very very small

432
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,439
small patch to the draft

433
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,320
so murray don't make it uh stop you from

434
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,200
reviewing the document

435
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,120
uh no problem this is reminding me is

436
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,720
this going through

437
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,559
another working your blast caller that

438
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,919
closed already

439
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:31,039
that should be closed okay yep the

440
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,880
working group last call

441
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
is finished i was just checking if

442
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,360
there's anything to oh i would have

443
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
submitted it

444
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,559
a couple of weeks ago but life got in

445
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
the way and now i thought we're going to

446
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,600
be talking about now anyway i'll submit

447
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,280
it after this just in case some last

448
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,280
minute thing comes up

449
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,639
okay yeah when it goes into publication

450
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
requested that's when i'll be able to

451
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,720
finish

452
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,399
it otherwise it doesn't get my attention

453
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,919
as easily as stuff on

454
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,280
pending telechats so yeah

455
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,200
which brings me to my request

456
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
can this be put into publication

457
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,080
requested

458
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,918
i think we discussed this uh maybe even

459
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,799
a couple months ago

460
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,320
yep we can do that i i wasn't sure if

461
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,080
this was the final version to do it but

462
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
i can certainly go ahead and do that now

463
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,159
it's

464
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,600
the last call has expired and there's

465
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,600
been no feedback on that

466
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,559
all right um

467
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,639
next slide just to triple check

468
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:34,480
um fairly new section

469
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
about recommended extensions

470
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,960
do people have any feelings about

471
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,600
whether we should

472
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,200
mention acl and multi multi mailbox

473
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:53,840
search

474
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:53,840
or anything else for that matter um

475
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,360
i don't have strong opinions on that

476
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,158
fuzzy's already in which is the main

477
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,439
thing in search

478
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,679
that that i really care about

479
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,640
but certainly i mean recommending is is

480
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,760
pretty

481
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,480
lightweight it's not

482
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,480
a requirement

483
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,760
yeah i suppose um

484
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,240
writing a client i found bits of acl

485
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,039
expect to be useful for example some

486
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
clients issue my rights very frequently

487
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
just to see whether they are allowed to

488
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,760
do various operations which

489
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,520
so um i

490
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,240
would be weakly suggesting to add

491
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,760
acl to the list just as a you know

492
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,679
obviously it might not work for

493
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,840
access control models for some mail

494
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,760
stores but if you do it you know do it

495
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,439
this way kind of thing

496
00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:00,240
yep that makes sense and list returned

497
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,240
my rights as well

498
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,480
yeah i'd be in favor of including pcl

499
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:16,000
all right um multi-mailbox search

500
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
i think it it's a great functionality

501
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,799
not sure how

502
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,679
widespread it is so maybe

503
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,679
not just yet

504
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,840
but if you have an opinion please

505
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
come to the mic

506
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,360
it doesn't hurt either way as far as i'm

507
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,679
concerned because it's just recommended

508
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
so

509
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:45,840
you do it or you don't do it depending

510
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,840
how you feel as a server implementer

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,600
yeah well um i did add some weasley

512
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,120
words in the document saying that

513
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,520
uh if you don't see your favorite

514
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,639
extension here it doesn't mean that it's

515
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,639
not recommended so

516
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,280
just to make sure that people don't

517
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,639
think that these are you know

518
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,639
more blessed than others

519
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,678
but

520
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,679
i'm happy to edit if people are using it

521
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,918
we aren't we're doing other evil stuff

522
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,158
that's mostly gmap these days

523
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,159
what

524
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:42,799
okay uh is this the last slide i think

525
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,799
one more i think next steps

526
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,240
awesome all right then i will

527
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,760
submit it apologies if you can hear the

528
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,000
noisy helicopter that's just come over

529
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,039
my

530
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,640
house we cannot

531
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,480
excellent i have a very high quality

532
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
microphone it it

533
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,400
collects things at my mouth and not much

534
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,120
else which is fantastic because it's

535
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,480
super loud for me

536
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,760
so um just back on fetch preview

537
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,640
i put in an rfc editor note for the

538
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,080
a small edit that we had talked with rob

539
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
wilton about

540
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,199
and that michael hadn't put in but other

541
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,000
than that i

542
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,640
uh it's fine so i i gave it the final

543
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,360
approval

544
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,480
you should see it going to the rfc

545
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,479
editor queue anytime

546
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,559
great thank you

547
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,399
cool um

548
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,000
then we are done with i'm at four rev

549
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,360
two and we are well ahead of schedule at

550
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,159
the moment

551
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,439
but i guess we may as well move on to

552
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:56,320
our next topic

553
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,320
which is quota so alexi welcome back

554
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,000
yeah i was um my apologies for

555
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,039
i just posted the zero three yesterday

556
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,440
because

557
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,440
i haven't done much on it um

558
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:19,440
but changes are fairly simple

559
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:22,080
next slide please

560
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,080
next slide

561
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,799
yeah so um i was debating this for very

562
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,240
long time about

563
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,039
whether the document specifies status

564
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
deleted and

565
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,600
capability storage which is number of

566
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,440
deleted messages and number

567
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,559
uh total ties of delete messages

568
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,279
um i was sort of debating uh

569
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,360
four months with myself whether they

570
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,440
should be tied to specific

571
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,039
capabilities as in you know if your

572
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
server supports

573
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,080
quarter on message numbers then you

574
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,480
should support my

575
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,120
status deleted um

576
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,200
i didn't get much feedback on this but i

577
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,279
thought i'll just go ahead and

578
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,720
go with it and make it slightly easier

579
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,520
to implement

580
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,279
uh obviously if you do both uh already

581
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,279
that make no change

582
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,279
you know it doesn't make any difference

583
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,360
for you but if you are thinking about

584
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,480
implementing one another

585
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,799
then it makes it slightly easier to

586
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,520
implement on the server side

587
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,000
and then the idea is deleted and stated

588
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,960
deleted

589
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,159
storage is client can answer ask the

590
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,039
question

591
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,880
um how much space can i free to get

592
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,480
under quarter for example this sort of

593
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,039
thing

594
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,840
that's the point of that

595
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,840
next slide

596
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:59,760
oh yeah that's actually

597
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,760
possibly a question about

598
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:07,520
a map4f2

599
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:10,960
basically syntactic issue is that

600
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,440
response codes are not allowed to

601
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,520
have close square bracket and

602
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,190
tags are at the moment allowed to have

603
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,229
this

604
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,229
[Music]

605
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,799
do people have a strong opinion either

606
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,520
way i um

607
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,200
on one hand we can tighten definition of

608
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,039
tag to disallow this but

609
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
if there is any client that decides to

610
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,960
generate tags with this

611
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:40,639
then they will become non-compliant

612
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,640
with this change i'm slightly

613
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,559
apprehensive about it

614
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,240
yeah clients man

615
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,000
i would be pretty happy to say once

616
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,480
you've enabled map4rev2 you're not

617
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
allowed to use that in tags but

618
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,559
the problem is what do you do for i'm

619
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,279
for rev one

620
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,080
clients do they not have this over quota

621
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,760
supported

622
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,960
is it something that only gets turned on

623
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,960
in our map for rev2

624
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,080
or do you not generate them if the tag

625
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,879
is bogus

626
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,799
yeah i suppose we can say that you know

627
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,840
it will work most of the time as in

628
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,240
you know unless you have a stupid tag

629
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,678
it will work uh over quarter has

630
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,720
actually two forms one is

631
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,039
uh just over quarter with no tag uh it

632
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,960
means you know for the current

633
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,240
the current operation uh and over

634
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,600
quarters space tag

635
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,360
is for cases where um

636
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,039
you're moving message like from one

637
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,520
mailbox to another you sort of want to

638
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,158
know whether your current one is

639
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,279
reporter or the destination one so it

640
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,520
helps a little bit

641
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,520
um

642
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,360
how important is this uh

643
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,439
do people think as in to convey this

644
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,080
information that over quarter relates to

645
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,080
a specific

646
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,840
command as opposed to the current

647
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,840
mailbox

648
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
i don't think it's generally going to be

649
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,760
important

650
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,120
if if you're doing a move operation then

651
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,039
over quota is very likely to be the

652
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,399
destination and regardless your response

653
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,840
to getting an over quoted message is

654
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,439
going to be to tell the user hey you

655
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,799
can't do that

656
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,840
you hit a quota limit and you can then

657
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,120
poll the quotas at the various locations

658
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,120
if you want to check what happened

659
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:55,520
okay so actually uh

660
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,039
yeah sort of just like this but i think

661
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,639
you answered my question that it's

662
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,120
probably just drop this feature and

663
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,919
don't bother with

664
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,279
um this will avoid all sort of

665
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,799
complications

666
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:13,200
fine let's do that

667
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:16,639
unless i hear otherwise

668
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,399
i'll do this in an extra vision i think

669
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,399
that's it what's the next

670
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,559
is there are more slides to this i don't

671
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,239
remember now future directions

672
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,120
yeah my usual questions basically

673
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,559
anything missing anything

674
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:38,158
should be removed i think this is ready

675
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,158
for working group last call

676
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
um

677
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,279
cool should i do that with the next

678
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,080
document whether where the

679
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,080
uh over quota space tags been removed

680
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,799
uh fine i mean i guess you can always

681
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,880
upload that during yeah i can start the

682
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,320
working group last call now

683
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679
and just note that you'll be uploading

684
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,678
one more version of the document that

685
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,919
will have this minor edit

686
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,080
yes that that would be my preferred

687
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,399
solution if you're happy with this

688
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,399
cool

689
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
done

690
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:34,479
awesome all right thank you alexi

691
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,480
uh next topic is gmap civ snooze from

692
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,760
ken

693
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,639
okay so uh the first revision zero zero

694
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,158
pretty much encapsulates what we have

695
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,679
implemented and are using

696
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,279
at uh fast smell at this moment

697
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,840
the next slide if you want to move

698
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,840
forward please

699
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,600
so what are we talking about here so

700
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,360
it's basically a sid action

701
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,279
that postpones the following of a

702
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,918
message to a later point in time

703
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,799
which essentially means that it behaves

704
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,159
very much like

705
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,760
a file into which is delayed

706
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,159
at some point in the future the draft

707
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,399
is somewhat vague on the actual

708
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,559
mechanics of house news works

709
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,760
but it does discuss that this could be

710
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,678
done either via

711
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:26,080
a special met mailbox or via smtp

712
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,000
currently we use a special mailbox at

713
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,240
fast mail

714
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,039
next slide please

715
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,519
so here's a current syntax um there's

716
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,000
one

717
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,039
required argument which is a list of

718
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,519
times

719
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,480
uh in hour minute second format

720
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,919
along with that there's a time zone id

721
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:54,080
string which is a a timezone ib

722
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,559
there is a list of weekdays using

723
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,240
strings but they're digits from 0 to 6

724
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,399
that borrows from

725
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,080
ned's date draft and finally there's a

726
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,918
destination mailbox

727
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,080
that you want the message to appear in

728
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:14,480
once it has awakened from its

729
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:17,199
snooze next slide please

730
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,080
so basically the uh combination of

731
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,360
weekdays

732
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,240
and times forms a chronological list

733
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,199
of awakened times so when a message

734
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,519
arrives

735
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,039
it gets snoozed until the next awaken

736
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,960
time in that list so

737
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,039
a couple quick examples obviously if

738
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,919
you've got something that's uh

739
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
monday through friday awaken times of 9

740
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,360
00

741
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,840
a.m and 3 p.m the message arrives at 8

742
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,918
a.m

743
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,158
it'll awaken the same day at nine it

744
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,399
arrives at three

745
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,480
um pixel if it arrives at noon it'll

746
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,879
it'll awaken at three the same day

747
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,080
and similarly if it arrives after three

748
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
pm on monday

749
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,158
it'll show up the following tuesday and

750
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,240
if it shows up

751
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,399
on the weekend late friday or saturday

752
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,320
or sunday would show up on monday

753
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,199
pretty straightforward i respect

754
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,200
next slide please

755
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,959
so we also support with our current

756
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,320
implementation of these various

757
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,600
extensions

758
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
so if you have imp for flags you can

759
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,519
specify

760
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,279
and add flags and remove flags option

761
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,960
which will set an unset flags when the

762
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,080
message is awakened

763
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,960
um you can use the

764
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,960
uh map4 flags with the variables if you

765
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,200
want to set something at snooze time

766
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,360
that's done via the internal variable so

767
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,760
that would be a set flag or add flag

768
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,678
actions

769
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,360
separately um

770
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,960
additionally going back to one of our

771
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,240
earlier conversations we actually

772
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,440
support

773
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,799
create special use a mailbox id

774
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,840
i will certainly update this draft to

775
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:56,080
discuss that mailbox id and special use

776
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,199
are mutually exclusive uh in that

777
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,360
respect but

778
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,240
in any case all three of those options

779
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,439
have to do with the

780
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,799
awaken mailbox not the

781
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,918
snooze mailbox

782
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,918
uh next slide please

783
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,399
so it was mentioned on the list by

784
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,239
stefan i believe uh he asked

785
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,560
why this is a separate action versus

786
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,359
just being additional parameters or

787
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,320
arguments

788
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,279
uh keep and file into which seems like a

789
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,679
logical discussion to have

790
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,119
two questions are what's the syntax

791
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,800
going to look like

792
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,760
and more importantly at least for our

793
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,119
use case how do you specify flags to be

794
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,440
set at snooze time

795
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,770
and at the awaken time

796
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,839
next slide please in terms of

797
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,599
[Music]

798
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,639
syntax i think there are three possible

799
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,679
options maybe more

800
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,520
if someone here has uh alternate

801
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,599
solutions i'm

802
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,960
open to hearing them so we could just

803
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,320
jam all the additional

804
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,520
arguments uh in line with the existing

805
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
file into

806
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,079
arguments um but if you've got something

807
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,200
that's gonna support

808
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,440
um you know the times

809
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,078
the weekdays the timezone id create

810
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
and special use the the list of

811
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,000
arguments is going to get pretty

812
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,079
unwieldy

813
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,760
kind of what we already have with uh fcc

814
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,800
uh i did some digging around the abn f

815
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,359
for civ itself

816
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,880
and it appears as if even though it

817
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,160
might be ugly

818
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,359
we could use the test list syntax

819
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,720
at the end of a command which appears to

820
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,640
be legal

821
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,160
so there's an example there of what this

822
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,960
may look like

823
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,399
um it kind of encapsulates all this new

824
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,440
specific stuff

825
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,119
uh into its own uh apprentice

826
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,640
uh its own um

827
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,760
structure at the the very tail end um

828
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,240
don't know how people feel about that uh

829
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,680
additionally on the next slide it also

830
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,279
looks like we could use

831
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,440
a block at the end of filing to or keep

832
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,760
which also appears to be legal for the

833
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,480
syntax

834
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,119
this seems a little bit cleaner to me

835
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,800
but again

836
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,000
it may confuse some parts just not sure

837
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,000
i actually haven't tried it with our

838
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,680
parser to see

839
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,440
how this would work it's also somewhat

840
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
confusing in that in this case snooze

841
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,160
really isn't its own

842
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,160
command it's just a way of

843
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,279
parameterizing file into

844
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,399
any comments or suggestions

845
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,119
um making this a separate

846
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,240
make making this part of keep a file

847
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,400
into and how to do the syntax

848
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,319
what is the advantage of making a part

849
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,520
of keep or fall into

850
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,520
other than than reusing the name i guess

851
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,839
i don't see any per se

852
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
but i'm open to hearing any argument

853
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,279
when people um list

854
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,520
interactions with other actions

855
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,119
this is less likely to be forgotten if

856
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:25,119
it's already an existing action

857
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,200
that i know it might not be a strong

858
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,720
argument but the fewer actions we have

859
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,759
the easier it is to list how you

860
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,759
interact with all of them

861
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,839
this is true

862
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,760
can uh ken can you uh

863
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,760
remind me why you want flags to be both

864
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,880
at the snooze time and then at delivery

865
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
time

866
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,599
i could let neil uh make that argument

867
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,359
if he wants to jump in

868
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,359
otherwise i'll i'll go ahead

869
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,320
sure uh is this on yes yes we can hear

870
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,160
you yep all right

871
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:15,920
great um yeah so basically

872
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,598
um at delivery time

873
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,960
the flags are set as pony normal stuff

874
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,079
so you might mark red

875
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,680
or pin or whatever uh but then at

876
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,720
awaken time um we set a particular

877
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,440
dollar new flag

878
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
so that we can mark out those messages

879
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,240
especially when they move back to your

880
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
inbox and then once when you actually

881
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,439
open the message we clear that flag

882
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,640
um we

883
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,079
and because conversations amalgamate

884
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,118
different messages some of which may

885
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,680
be snooze you

886
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,800
they also make keywords and so that that

887
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,040
could lead to

888
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,040
um

889
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,720
yeah so so so that that's basically so

890
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
you you could leak out even while it's

891
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,598
still in the snooze folder because it

892
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,240
might be flooded with other messages

893
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,079
i guess in theory you could set it when

894
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,479
you snooze

895
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,079
but i i think yeah it's safer to do it

896
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,520
when it you wake up because

897
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,280
you could again have more client logic

898
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,480
to exclude stuff that's currently lose

899
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,800
from the keywords

900
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,599
kind of malformation within a thread but

901
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,599
that's the reasoning

902
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,400
the other issue we have in our

903
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,960
implementation is because

904
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,359
we actually have a news mailbox that

905
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,359
that an imap client can see

906
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,640
the user could fiddle with flags and

907
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,240
change something that they may actually

908
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,400
may want to have

909
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,279
um set or run set when it actually does

910
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,480
get awakened

911
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,119
right yeah but this is really a you're

912
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,200
expecting user to sort of project how

913
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,119
this is working for your implementation

914
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,319
if they mess with flags you know they

915
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,320
probably know what they're doing

916
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,279
just well i mean yeah it depends which

917
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,480
flags obviously

918
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,800
clients make it very easy to change

919
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,720
things like the scene flag and

920
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
flag flag etc um

921
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,960
uh yeah i can have i'll bring up the

922
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,000
code down have a quick look but

923
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:14,000
it might be okay if you only set them

924
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,599
on delivery um

925
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,040
but i'd have to double check all the

926
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,280
things we do to see if that is going to

927
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,279
work

928
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,200
i just see this as an option that

929
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,680
users are likely to confuse themselves

930
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,960
with i don't object to having it but i

931
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,078
can't imagine

932
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,079
actually using it and i

933
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,280
can see if you don't use it very

934
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:39,839
carefully

935
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,440
you're going to wind up getting some

936
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,759
parts of a conversation

937
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,440
delivered right away and others snoozed

938
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,640
which probably isn't what you're really

939
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,480
meant to have so

940
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,520
i mean as long as the

941
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,599
if all the messages are actually

942
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,200
delivered to a mailbox it's just it's

943
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
delivered to a snooze mailbox and

944
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,720
the conversation view in your client

945
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,040
shows all of them

946
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,078
then you won't like miss some that were

947
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,440
snoozed earlier if

948
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,520
something else comes in like that's

949
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,440
actually a valid use case if like

950
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,960
you normally you would snooze it because

951
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,240
if it's from a main list you don't care

952
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,839
about too much but if it comes from a

953
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,200
particular person you do care about you

954
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
don't want that to be snooze

955
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,160
that conversation will now show up in

956
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,440
your inbox and the previous messages

957
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,560
from people you don't normally care so

958
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
much about that were snooze will still

959
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,160
be in thread

960
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,680
for you to get the context that depends

961
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920
upon whether your client

962
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,799
is uh threading them that way and not

963
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,680
all clients

964
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,119
do that's true that's presumably a

965
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,720
thread across mailbox not just within a

966
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,839
member so it might be worth putting

967
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,560
something like that

968
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
in uh as non-normative text in in the

969
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,839
document

970
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:49,280
um somewhere of uh maybe implementation

971
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:51,920
considerations

972
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,160
just warning that this can cause some

973
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,839
funny things depending on how the client

974
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,200
displays the messages

975
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,759
that's all yeah i i brought this up

976
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,879
on the list um that there's some

977
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,000
security in

978
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,680
um you know implications here um

979
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,359
and they they vary pretty dramatically

980
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,799
depending on how you implement this if

981
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,640
you implement it like

982
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,480
using a future release sort of mechanism

983
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,680
uh then the messages aren't visible at

984
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,040
all anywhere until they're unsnoozed

985
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,839
um and that has some really i think

986
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,880
potentially

987
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,000
you know serious implications um

988
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,680
you know to users uh and if you use the

989
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
mailbox trick where you put them in one

990
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,560
and then switch them to another you get

991
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,240
different behavior

992
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,680
but the other thing you you know when

993
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,279
you use those different tricks you know

994
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,319
the delivery dates are going to be very

995
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,160
different

996
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,319
and the threading situation is going to

997
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,359
be different um you know

998
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,640
lots of potential confuse you know for

999
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,640
confusion here yeah i mean we didn't

1000
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:54,078
really go with the deliver to a special

1001
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,160
mailbox one which i think solves the

1002
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,680
most these problems the delivery date is

1003
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,839
the regular delivery date because it's

1004
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,200
not delivered late um it's threaded in

1005
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,640
with all the other messages immediately

1006
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,680
if you want to go find you can search

1007
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,040
with everything else

1008
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,919
um i i think that the the reason the

1009
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,279
spot's kind of

1010
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,000
more open on that you know maybe maybe

1011
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,680
the right thing to do

1012
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,760
it that's how you have to implement it

1013
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,240
if that's you know if that's bad

1014
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,240
yeah i think

1015
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,640
yeah i think it was the spec was written

1016
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,200
this way to just try and

1017
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,480
make it easier to accommodate for if

1018
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,680
there's existing systems doing something

1019
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,720
different but having said that

1020
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,000
i don't think any i know of are doing a

1021
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,640
delayed delivery

1022
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,240
um but please correct me if someone

1023
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,759
knows about one that is implementing

1024
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,520
this in a different way

1025
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,599
well the point is you're bothering

1026
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,720
themselves you have no way of predicting

1027
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,599
what people are going to do in the

1028
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,279
future

1029
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,960
you know if someone sees publishes in

1030
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,160
rfc and they already have

1031
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,400
you know they already have future

1032
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,839
release that's just a logical way to

1033
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,400
implement it

1034
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,759
i mean yeah absolutely i was saying

1035
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,280
sorry the issue that ned and i are

1036
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,400
bringing up isn't that we shouldn't

1037
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
do this but that you need to say more in

1038
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,520
the document

1039
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,520
to guide people who are implementing it

1040
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,960
on what the pitfalls are

1041
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,800
and you know you can say that if this is

1042
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,480
implemented this way it works better

1043
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,160
than if it's implemented that way or

1044
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,000
something like that

1045
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,839
um but without that you might get some

1046
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,760
very weird implementations that could

1047
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,319
cause problems

1048
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,000
yeah and you you've got a security issue

1049
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,359
either way because people

1050
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,040
you know average users aren't going to

1051
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,799
know to look for some special snooze

1052
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,279
mailbox

1053
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,920
you didn't even gonna occur in the um

1054
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,240
queue for a while too so let's not

1055
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,240
forget

1056
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,480
so who's

1057
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:51,839
daniel gilmore is is in queue just yep

1058
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,839
just talk isn't it

1059
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,839
still very soft

1060
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,079
okay hopefully um

1061
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,920
so uh i i want to uh second that the

1062
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,960
other thing i think is right on that we

1063
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,319
should

1064
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,640
think about how this is going to

1065
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,640
actually perform for for the user

1066
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,078
um i think barry's concerned that like

1067
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,799
if someone setting flags that they know

1068
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,000
what they're doing

1069
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,599
is maybe not um

1070
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,880
maybe not correct what we're specifying

1071
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,280
here is not actually something that's

1072
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,280
like

1073
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,040
a user-facing feature this is like a

1074
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,880
mechanism that i would imagine

1075
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,800
good male clients will

1076
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
use to implement something that the user

1077
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,079
is going to understand right like

1078
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,520
they'll have a fuse button in it and

1079
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,800
they'll choose one standard set of

1080
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,359
behaviors

1081
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,560
um and they'll implement and they'll

1082
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,759
they'll encode that maybe

1083
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,040
via active uh command on the back end

1084
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,440
but the user is not going to be

1085
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,319
like crafting what these specific

1086
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,800
options are

1087
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,079
right that just seems unlikely to me so

1088
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,359
i think you know

1089
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,319
i think that kind of guidance for um

1090
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,319
male user agent implementers um is going

1091
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,520
to depend on what the back ends actually

1092
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,880
do and so i think that

1093
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,640
you know this this idea that will make

1094
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,280
it generic and you can do arbitrary back

1095
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,598
ends

1096
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,400
isn't actually a safe thing to specify

1097
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,160
so i i support the idea of

1098
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,000
um saying that this is you know you

1099
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,640
really shouldn't do this with smtp

1100
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,960
um you know delayed delivery or anything

1101
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,960
like that

1102
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,040
yeah i i'd be happy with that i also

1103
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,400
think it makes sense because if you're

1104
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,759
this is just for basically creating

1105
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,800
rules that snooze if you're going to

1106
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,640
implement snooze

1107
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,920
like manually for a user you're going to

1108
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,359
need a special folder for anyway the

1109
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,640
best years have already been delivered

1110
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:47,920
uh so it it's much better to use a

1111
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,279
single mechanism and have two different

1112
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,920
mechanisms of doing snooze depending

1113
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,720
whether it's

1114
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,599
on delivery time or manually afterwards

1115
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,160
um

1116
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,040
i also i just had another quick look at

1117
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,598
what we're doing

1118
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,200
um the reason we want uh to be able to

1119
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,319
set flags on awaken time

1120
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,598
uh the main one is uh some some users

1121
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,960
said that they want it to be marked

1122
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,160
unread when it's awakened

1123
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,599
but they don't want it to be marked

1124
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,078
unread immediately because they might

1125
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,599
have a

1126
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,880
view that shows all on their mail they

1127
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,319
currently have and so you don't want it

1128
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,560
showing up there until it's

1129
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,560
news

1130
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,839
we include that as an example um

1131
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,599
right i mean as you're writing this

1132
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:31,279
draft we're thinking about how

1133
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,200
implementers are likely to use it

1134
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,200
and just having you know a sentence

1135
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,319
example of you know this is one way that

1136
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,839
you can use it

1137
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:43,200
uh might might be useful that

1138
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:45,040
yeah that makes sense right without

1139
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,240
example like there is quite a lot of

1140
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,160
extra complexity

1141
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,118
that the draft is proposing which is

1142
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:55,040
like you know

1143
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,440
i think i'm just about to be convinced

1144
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,880
that it might be worth it but

1145
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,960
please add an example at least yeah

1146
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,720
yeah i i definitely would probably lean

1147
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,800
towards i think mandating you

1148
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,759
use a special mailbox not future release

1149
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,800
and

1150
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,839
let's register if you're not already the

1151
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,839
role for the imac game roles

1152
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:21,839
uh special use registry uh

1153
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,839
like yeah

1154
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,160
i'm fine with that appending any strong

1155
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:35,839
objections to leaving it

1156
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,839
open-ended like it is now

1157
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,800
um as far as synthetic is concerned um

1158
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:46,720
the the one on the screen i think it's

1159
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,440
very cute but

1160
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,000
it's sort of i'm concerned that it will

1161
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,440
break

1162
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,040
quite fastly it might not be a bad

1163
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,280
thing you know if your pastor doesn't

1164
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,520
know about it

1165
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,520
um

1166
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,680
yeah that comes down to whether we want

1167
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,920
to make this its own action

1168
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,799
or roll it into keeping file into right

1169
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,599
so i think that's the first decision we

1170
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:15,119
made and then

1171
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:18,319
if we decide to go with the keeper 512

1172
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,319
with the settle on the syntax

1173
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:25,119
right do you have any strong opinions on

1174
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,118
that alexi or no

1175
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,280
um i have slight preference for using

1176
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,040
file into

1177
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,880
but then it comes with so you're saying

1178
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,880
it comes with extra synthetic complexity

1179
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,800
i don't know or you have a lot of extra

1180
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,480
arguments

1181
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,640
yeah it's it's news

1182
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,400
yeah as neil said it's not really making

1183
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,759
it more complex it's just making it

1184
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,640
unwieldy with the number of options that

1185
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:55,440
can be in there and they

1186
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,240
i guess i'm just i don't like the fact

1187
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,960
that you've got

1188
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:04,000
a set of flags a set of options that

1189
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,760
apply to one particular functionality

1190
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
that could be spread all over the place

1191
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,000
right

1192
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,440
by definition the tags are unordered so

1193
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,720
you know you could have these things

1194
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,680
intermingled with any other file into um

1195
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:20,319
argument like we had with with fcc which

1196
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,319
you know

1197
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,839
after having written that um and

1198
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:26,720
implemented it it this looks kind of

1199
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,000
ugly

1200
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,839
yeah i think it's gonna be cleaner as a

1201
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,040
separate command because you have

1202
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,400
multiple arguments you need for the

1203
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,279
snows and as ken said if they're

1204
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,359
intermixed with

1205
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,640
other arguments and they only make sense

1206
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,040
if you like

1207
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,319
a snooze add flags argument only makes

1208
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,920
sense if you have a separate snooze

1209
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,359
argument so it's invalid if you have one

1210
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,400
not the other

1211
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:46,480
it seems cleaner to me to have a

1212
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,559
separate command but i don't really care

1213
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,200
what the syntax is usually i'm just

1214
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,200
it's just might be

1215
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,359
actually related to that do we have a i

1216
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,359
am registry for action

1217
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,119
we there's a registry for the extensions

1218
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,759
but

1219
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,079
not specifically for actions i don't

1220
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,079
believe

1221
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,119
it's just it's just an extensions

1222
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,960
registry i mean

1223
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,000
you know an extension can define one

1224
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,280
action zero actions 50 actions

1225
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,280
i know but it would be nice you know uh

1226
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,000
even if you're writing you like if

1227
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,880
you're considering interactions

1228
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,200
or you know look up in action and find

1229
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,119
out

1230
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,040
all the other seeds of the being

1231
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,200
mentioned and all of this

1232
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,319
yeah i get your point it's it's a valid

1233
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,640
point that

1234
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,000
you know we didn't really think about

1235
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,680
you know the fact that things have to

1236
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,160
enumerate their interactions pretty

1237
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,160
thoroughly

1238
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,160
ned i know you've you've implemented a

1239
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,640
lot of the stiff stuff do you have any

1240
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,720
strong

1241
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,720
opinions on whether to make this its own

1242
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,839
separate action or to roll it into

1243
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
keeping file into

1244
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,520
i don't have a strong opinion though i

1245
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,598
really don't

1246
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,400
um there's arguments either way i

1247
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,040
i'm i am a little concerned about the

1248
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,160
whole

1249
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,440
you know using tricky syntax

1250
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,558
um to do things i wonder if i mean

1251
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,400
i can handle that in my implementation

1252
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,559
but i

1253
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:36,240
uh i mean i have the ability to

1254
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:38,559
you know um evaluate arguments

1255
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,720
you know it says mine's essentially call

1256
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,240
by name is what it boils down to

1257
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,839
and if your implementation works that

1258
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,118
way you can probably handle this but

1259
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,839
they're probably our implementations

1260
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,839
don't work that way

1261
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,359
yeah fair point we're kind of

1262
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:58,640
limited by the by the fact that 5228

1263
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:00,078
does not allow arguments to arguments

1264
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,759
and these are only two ways that these

1265
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,400
are only two ways they could find even

1266
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,400
shoehorn stuff

1267
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:20,079
all right

1268
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,079
um i'm not

1269
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,240
i i mean you know the way i though you

1270
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,640
know i i

1271
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,319
this will probably sound stupid but uh

1272
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,598
you know basically what you do is you go

1273
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,640
through the code and look for all the

1274
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,319
places where you're

1275
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,680
doing those you're looking around at

1276
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,119
file enters and you make sure that

1277
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,160
they're looking at snoozes where it's

1278
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,839
appropriate

1279
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,520
so it's not that hard to add

1280
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,799
you know all of the interact you know to

1281
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,800
deal with all the interactions

1282
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,000
right again that's how my implementation

1283
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,000
works who knows

1284
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,680
yeah that that's how ours does too it

1285
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:59,680
kind of treats 512 and snoozes

1286
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,799
you know equivalent actions with

1287
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,799
somewhat different semantics

1288
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,919
what can i say

1289
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,000
i think after listening to this i'm

1290
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,520
leaning towards

1291
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,040
let's do a separate uh action

1292
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,800
just that's that's kind of what i'm

1293
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,599
hearing too uh

1294
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,839
and uh we can have a separate discussion

1295
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,359
you know

1296
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:30,000
uh registry for actions that might be

1297
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,319
just a nice thing to do anyway

1298
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,440
i i noted that as potentially a separate

1299
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,040
draft

1300
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,839
um anyone want to volunteer to author

1301
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,839
that

1302
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:47,359
well i seem to care so i think

1303
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,040
yeah but if somebody wants to help me

1304
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:53,839
out i mean it should be just a simple

1305
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,839
iron registration

1306
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,919
cool all right i don't think i have any

1307
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,599
more slides i think the last slide was

1308
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,839
basically discussing what we've already

1309
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,839
discussed

1310
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,079
yep that's the final slide

1311
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,399
all right um so i guess the next step is

1312
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:25,599
for you to go back and rewrite

1313
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:27,520
uh having made it that it requires

1314
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,200
the message to be placed into into a

1315
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,040
folder somewhere that the user can see

1316
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,839
somehow

1317
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,839
and creating the snoozed registration

1318
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:40,319
and i didn't quite follow is is a snooze

1319
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,839
mailbox then

1320
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:46,319
a special use mailbox a new kind of

1321
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,839
okay it's a new special use so that will

1322
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,839
get registered

1323
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:57,359
are we going to limit this to imap

1324
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,359
servers

1325
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,559
oh it's just for example

1326
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,400
i'm sorry i like say i was talking over

1327
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,920
there i didn't hear what you said uh it

1328
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,920
was just as well does jm app

1329
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,520
yes that that's so that's i mean yeah my

1330
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,520
question was

1331
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,079
we don't want to limit this to just imap

1332
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,359
servers it obviously it could you could

1333
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,880
make this work with a mailed or

1334
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:20,880
mailed their server as well right

1335
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,359
yeah so we can make it that if if uh

1336
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:30,558
you're using an imap or jam up server

1337
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,880
then you should

1338
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,079
file these messages into a mailbox with

1339
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,440
special use snoozed

1340
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,280
as registered here right

1341
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,640
and then but people can still do it

1342
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,559
other ways so

1343
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,879
yeah it

1344
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,559
i don't know maybe a silly argument but

1345
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,680
if you use pop for access

1346
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,960
with save then you this will be just not

1347
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,078
something you can access

1348
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:59,280
probably until you you get the message

1349
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,000
just to be clear we want to remove any

1350
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,680
hint of using smtp to implement this

1351
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,079
from the draft correct

1352
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,879
i think i've got even more over

1353
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,680
suggesting

1354
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,680
not to do that

1355
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,839
yeah that's what i had okay but we just

1356
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,920
want to discuss

1357
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:18,400
potential security issues and pitfalls

1358
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,400
in doing so

1359
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,839
ideally yes okay i'll

1360
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,760
i'll craft some text along those lines

1361
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,000
and then hopefully i can get some help

1362
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,119
with

1363
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,240
wordsmithing things that aren't clear

1364
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,240
or incomplete

1365
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,040
right all right thanks thanks everyone

1366
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,598
the last

1367
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,720
thing that we have here is just a glance

1368
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,720
at our milestones

1369
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,480
looks like civ ai we still need to come

1370
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:49,839
back to

1371
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,599
quota is there to be sent off timings

1372
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,720
about right there ima 402 will be

1373
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,839
submitted now

1374
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,558
sip mailbox id has been submitted so i

1375
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:01,279
can mark that one as done

1376
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:04,960
and sif's news has been adopted so i'll

1377
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,960
update that and mark that as done

1378
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,799
i don't think we've got anything new to

1379
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,160
add there other than

1380
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:14,960
to adopt a document creating

1381
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,480
the civ actions registry do we have any

1382
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,240
other work

1383
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,839
that anyone wants this working group to

1384
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,839
be doing

1385
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:33,359
that was a a not really

1386
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,440
um because i suspect that given that we

1387
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,598
will finish this work off

1388
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,559
fairly early next year and we'll be very

1389
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:40,559
quiet for a little bit

1390
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,680
which i'm fine with until being a

1391
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,799
working group that can

1392
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,680
take up issues as they come up in this

1393
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:53,040
space because there's

1394
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,040
there's still plenty of action

1395
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,680
and how email core is going that being

1396
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,640
quiet for a while is a good thing

1397
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,640
i i agree

1398
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,240
