time you see the not well

12
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,120

so when you want to talk just

20
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,839
press the right icon which is the

21
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
microphone

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,958
share the camera

24
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
i don't expect you to share the screen

25
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,439
but we have a specific icon for that

26
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,640
and there are also other tools if we

27
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,920
would like to hum

28
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,920

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
daniel or mohammed did

111
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,800
it's just how we're going to coordinate

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,720
a response to that liaison statement

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,400
and will that be discussed on the

114
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
mailing list or is this something

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,280
the working group chairs are going to do

116
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,840
in coordination with the area director

117
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,840
and the its i2 liaison

118
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
so um is your question how are we going

119
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,839
to proceed or

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,839
is it a recommendation that um

121
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
yeah it's a question about how to

122
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,359
proceed and is this something that

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,959
he says to use a loose term is going to

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
be decided by the working group's

125
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,439
leadership

126
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
or is this something that the working

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
group is going to be involved in either

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,640
drafting a response

129
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
or approving the response before it gets

130
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
sent

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,080
so maybe eric wants to respond on that

132
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,959
yes indeed and thank you jim indeed

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
that's a good question

134
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,279
and the working group will reply so it

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,959
will be

136
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
i mean we will not spend hours and hours

137
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,079
on this but the point is that the

138
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,120
working group

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,040
itself will reply of course

140
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,480
the letter or the email will be written

141
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,120
by the chair

142
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,959
but content will be based on the working

143
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
group

144
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,479
yeah we will just be the pipe um so

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,279
i mean the idea is that if you want to

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,040
make comments

147
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
please provide those comments on the on

148
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,240
the mailing list and we will also make

149
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
it clear

150
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
that um this has been discussed

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
internally

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,839
sean

153
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
oh hi can you hear me now oh yeah um

154
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,519
they often do this while they'll lob

155
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,360
liaisons over at us and ask us to review

156
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,880
ask a working group to review

157
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,880
um their output it's up to you to decide

158
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,959
how much in-depth review you want to

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,600
provide either individuals the working

160
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,040
group

161
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,600
um so you know approach at

162
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
you know as you see fit but i think the

163
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,399
the

164
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
going up and using the existing channels

165
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,959
and making sure that it all gets

166
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,760
answered in a timely fashion is

167
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,599
important

168
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,880
you can literally just thank them for

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
their output document

170
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,959
and be done with it um you don't have to

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
technically enter into

172
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,319
any kind of back and forth with them but

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,720
it's up to you

174
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,720
thanks okay thank you

175
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,800
yeah i haven't had time to to go through

176
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,800
the document i must say

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:45,600
yet but um i hope it's not too

178
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,119
or forgotten to um what we're doing

179
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,120
okay so let's start

180
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
eric you want to say something

181
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,200
otherwise too please think the floor is

182
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,199
yours

183
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,519
actually i thought that the architecture

184
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,719
update was coming from schwei

185
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,760
oh okay right i took the the first uh

186
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,760
so i yeah

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,839
go ahead

188
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,279
i mean at least me i have problem

189
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,319
hearing you

190
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,320
he's very quiet

191
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,839
it looks you're not speaking to your mic

192
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
now to me it sounds completely quiet

193
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,880
okay one two three but now yeah

194
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,720
that's better to me okay all right all

195
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,360
right just take off my speaker

196
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
so i want to say thanks to for uh making

197
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,519
the

198
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,200
effort already um hopefully we can make

199
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,000
this out together on time

200
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,240
uh next slide please

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,920
so we're sending out the uh zero five

202
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
version just trying to address the

203
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,120
previous issues from the

204
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,160
uh i would say 10 reviewers already

205
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,720
uh we have a github to list other

206
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,519
issues which is not a shared to the

207
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,040
other person

208
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,200
except the author yet so we also try to

209
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,800
analyze the issues we're trying to

210
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,440
improve um

211
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,319
at the end of the presentation um just

212
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,480
to keep in mind that

213
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,519
we have not addressed all the comments

214
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,040
yet

215
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,760
uh i will specify what comment has been

216
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,959
addressed in uh following slide but we

217
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,079
haven't got the time

218
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,839
and the the i will see um

219
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,079
the first thing we want to try to

220
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,440
organize the context a little bit based

221
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,760
on the comment

222
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
and we needed to figure out what goes

223
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,519
where and

224
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,399
what really needed this draft once we

225
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
figured that out

226
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,320
um so the the rest just filled out the

227
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,160
details

228
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,839
uh hopefully under the working group

229
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,160
logical we can

230
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,160
get a solution on that next slide please

231
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,680
so the reason i put this office slide

232
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,760
here just to remind people

233
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
who are not a family or the i uh drip

234
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,720
drafts

235
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,920
i called the drip architecture

236
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,360
drafter a drip

237
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,040
ecosystem correct me if i'm wrong this

238
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,120
is my understanding

239
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,319
so yeah i mean i think the drip

240
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,079
architecture driver should

241
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,880
describe ecosystems including um

242
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,319
read which is called remote id design

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,680
emphasize on

244
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,920
why we use um um issued id

245
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,800
and instead of how so the details of

246
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,199
course gonna go to the specific draft um

247
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,839
then we also refer to the requirement

248
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
itself

249
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,480
and that's also some of the comments

250
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,479
from the previous already and the

251
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,760
architecture should also explain

252
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,800
um the relationships among

253
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,480
all the drip entities such as the uav

254
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,639
ground control station operator registry

255
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,760
and security trustworthy all these

256
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
entities

257
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
and the current arc draft including uh

258
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
all of them

259
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,319
so and stu has already shared offline a

260
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,638
list of the entities

261
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
which we needed to um i think we needed

262
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,240
to cherry pick

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,120
and discuss and hash out all the details

264
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
what should be

265
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,240
including this architecture so as far as

266
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,319
i can tell from the list

267
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,839
we have most entities covered in

268
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,920
solution draft in

269
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,760
in separate draft we just need to

270
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,279
explain how it's going to be used

271
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,880
and the relationship in between

272
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,079
different entities in the architecture

273
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,000
graph

274
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,359
i think that's the most the comment and

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,279
some of the comments from previous is

276
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,880
kind of overlapping but that's the main

277
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,079
concerns to explain the english uh

278
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,880
the connections between each of entities

279
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
uh next slide

280
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
next slide please yeah

281
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,240
thank you all right uh you can skip this

282
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
one just basically summarize what i said

283
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,440
from last slide

284
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
so uh you can you can skip with this one

285
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,440
okay so this is one of the uh summary we

286
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
have tried to address

287
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
on the new version some of the comments

288
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,959
are the same

289
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
with from others such as lack of a

290
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,239
broadcast

291
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,920
read introduction so we added section

292
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,839
1.1 1.2.2

293
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
which is borrowed from the requirement

294
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,800
uh documents

295
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
i think one of the comments from daniel

296
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,079
from you is actually trying to make sure

297
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,319
the architectural draft is

298
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,120
self-contained

299
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,480
so that's one of the things we taking

300
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,720
actions on it

301
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,959
and we also added section three to

302
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
explore all the um acronyms

303
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,239
that's the michael's comment there's too

304
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
many tl is and

305
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
it's hard to understand so we we try to

306
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,079
edit uh

307
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,000
as much as we can on the section three

308
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,599
so there's a new section on section four

309
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,720
um this is it for us id

310
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,279
um i expect the most in this section

311
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,040
will resolve lots of existing comments

312
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,759
such as like

313
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,599
uh why hdit is a perfect design i'll

314
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,079
call it perfect design for a read

315
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,519
and what perk pro what's the problem it

316
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,880
will solve

317
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,639
um so it's current format we put lots of

318
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,240
notes in there um because michael has

319
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,079
has comment i think it's pretty common

320
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,000
to list the issues

321
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,399
uh we're trying to address this issue in

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,799
this section um

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
and also the comments regarding inform

324
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,639
to language

325
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,280
usage that will be we will be gradually

326
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,439
fix it

327
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,319
once we put all the details in there so

328
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,120
that's shouldn't be a big deal

329
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,119
next slide please

330
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,640
so more comments regarding the hybrid

331
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,960
remote id subsection we remove that and

332
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,080
i've discussed with bob i think that's

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,280
not to be used useful anymore uh

334
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,559
hopefully everybody agrees that

335
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,200
again we added the broadcast id figure

336
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,440
and

337
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:52,480
we will put more explanations

338
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,360
for the comments regarding how

339
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,919
a broadcast study would be used without

340
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,159
networking or with networking

341
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,919
we also planning to address the safety

342
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,039
and the security issues

343
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
uh i would assume gonna be in section 10

344
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,080
security considerations

345
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,799
but there's i think there are three

346
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,600
people comment on that constantly and

347
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,720
amelia think that we need to make

348
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,760
distinction right

349
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,640
what is safety and security in in in the

350
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
architecture draft

351
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,880
uh okay

352
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,000
next slide please so this is uh

353
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,640
um this slide lists the things

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,120
at least i think we need to focus on uh

355
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,559
for

356
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,000
next one or two revisions so mostly

357
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,440
existing comments

358
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
uh uh maybe it's solved you will fill

359
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,919
out

360
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,639
all the details in the list items um

361
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,440
for the others like alex and i think and

362
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
uh

363
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,600
um his comment we have i haven't got

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,440
enough time to look at it but uh his

365
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,600
comment is more regarding why it is not

366
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,160
perfect i mean it's perfect i mean so we

367
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,559
need to explain that in section four

368
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,600
uh also as i already mentioned that we

369
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,120
have done

370
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,280
in section one and the detail of the

371
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,760
section 1.4 which is uh the

372
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,320
drip architecture overview and that

373
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,640
still needs

374
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,960
some work to explain drip ecosystems

375
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,480
plus the stews of uh

376
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,799
recommend uh sorry um uh at least over

377
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
the

378
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,639
uh entities will probably need to put

379
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,559
the some of the entities there

380
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:38,400
uh try to make connections um

381
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,039
um then section five um comments

382
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,960
regarding

383
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,559
adding a ds registry section i think

384
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,640
this is great comment

385
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,799
uh then we can use that session to

386
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,600
explain why reid

387
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,440
uh should be using reverse dns lookup

388
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,799
and i think that's one of daniel yours

389
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,559
commenting you

390
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,559
and also stu also um

391
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,160
uh i mean as i mentioned still stress

392
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
the list of uh uh

393
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,200
and youtube sorry the entities that will

394
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,679
be also explained in section five

395
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
currently there are only two or threes i

396
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,600
think a product source

397
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,320
and a registry is in there but the other

398
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,158
is not

399
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,918
i think i think it's important we

400
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,039
explain what other entities are

401
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,159
then in section 6

402
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,879
is more about how us id

403
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
can be used in the real world of project

404
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
or solve

405
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,639
practical problems uh things like http

406
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,720
naming collisions and that's one of the

407
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,200
comments we need to explain

408
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
and why hrit has a better encryption

409
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,840
than the others

410
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,840
like x509

411
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,879
so um i think

412
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,719
that's that's that's my last slide

413
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,640
that's a that's a summary

414
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,360
uh i have done and

415
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,320
the the things i in my mind things we

416
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:02,000
need to improve with this draft

417
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,600
so any comments i think this goes faster

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,559
than i expected but

419
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
that's all i want to say

420
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,400
okay good thank you do we have any

421
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,840
comments or

422
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,840
from the audience so when do you expect

423
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
them

424
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,919
the next version or do

425
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,639
well i'm guessing

426
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,600
in one or two weeks we should have a new

427
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,080
version

428
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,240
to get the architecture we want the the

429
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,158
structure we want it

430
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
uh right at least one or two weeks i

431
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,600
think we need to

432
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,520
we need to hash all the details um all

433
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,879
right i mean i only took it over like

434
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
two or three weeks so i need to

435
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
understand

436
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,480
the the the other draft uh

437
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
to understand what i mean i think the

438
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,120
first thing in this meeting we

439
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
understand if

440
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
because i keep seeing the drip uh

441
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
ecosystem

442
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,918
um when we're talking about the

443
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,240
architecture it's this the same concept

444
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:04,400
that you guys have or the working group

445
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,520
has like it is the architecture's

446
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,000
job to explain the ecosystem inside the

447
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,158
group

448
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,240
not outside the group right whatever we

449
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,760
have currently in our

450
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,280
working group repository so i think

451
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
that's uh that's the things we need to

452
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,039
agree on

453
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
uh because previous comments is to keep

454
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,919
explaining that

455
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,080
and droop architecture i mean we don't

456
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
have architecture but

457
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,439
in my mind we do have architecture but

458
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,120
should be focusing inside the group

459
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
that that's my understanding so i think

460
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,399
when you hash out the architecture

461
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,480
the structure first in one or two weeks

462
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,240
then the rest will be fitting details

463
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,679
and i think everybody can chip in

464
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,880
for that okay the original deadline

465
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,200
milestone we had should work out um but

466
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,080
they

467
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,159
consider this holiday season on december

468
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,439
and also the thanksgivings um

469
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,440
but you know expect some delays as well

470
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,480
okay right so um i i i i expect that

471
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
the next version uh people should commit

472
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,159
to

473
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,200
to get some reviews

474
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,520
right i i would i would

475
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,840
let people wait uh for next revision

476
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,879
because we have so many notes in there

477
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,879
uh just wait a little bit and then we

478
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,400
will call out people then

479
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,760
things are ready to for uh deep reviews

480
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,760
okay great andre

481
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,360

just getting ready for

486
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,320
my presentation testing if video works

487
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,320
and stuff

488
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,840

okay good so let's move on to the next

490
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,480
presentation

491
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:06,880
thank you very much bye

492
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
okay uh so my name is andre guerto from

493
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,760
linchpin university sweden and

494
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,559
i'm going to describe process for making

495
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,640
open source implementation of drip next

496
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:22,240
slide please so

497
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,640
it's a joint effort by

498
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
the nine students and me in the in the

499
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,720
course in the university

500
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,760
and we have two components to to develop

501
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,960
so first

502
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
openhip open source version which have

503
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
been

504
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,879
updating for for few years and the new

505
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,000
crypto

506
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,400
protocols that bob is

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,799
submitting in that draft and we also

508
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,600
took open source open drone id

509
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,960
as a starting point for for develop

510
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,240
observer app and also

511
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,240
a broadcast study

512
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,240
next slide please

513
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
so for hip we need to update that code

514
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,360
because

515
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,200
it's used in uh at least part of uh

516
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,360
solutions in indrip

517
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
so first we needed to make better

518
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,158
signature algorithm

519
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,120
for for signing messages so edward

520
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,960
digital's initial algorithm then the

521
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,199
structure of new arcades which

522
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,640
describe how the host identity tag is

523
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,480
made

524
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,919
and finally they're introducing

525
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,760
hierarchy into the heat

526
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,200
so that for example it's not like plain

527
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,720
text

528
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,679
128 string but

529
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
it's also include some data like who

530
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,679
issued this

531
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,679
hit next one

532
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,840
so this orchid actually now is a little

533
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,200
bit outdated because it's

534
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,520
describes the first version of um remote

535
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
id

536
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,240
draft but as you see the traditional

537
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,240
orchid they had the reserved prefix

538
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,279
and for for new orchid where we have

539
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
hierarchy

540
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,400
we need like a special hash function

541
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,919
called c shake

542
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,919
uh definable output and uh

543
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,120
it's also inco includes the id of

544
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:12,320
organization that issued it so it's a

545
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,320
new change next one

546
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,720
so for new crypto we have uh currently

547
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,720
implemented kiock cipher um

548
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,000
because it's light weight and more

549
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,000
efficient than ies

550
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,760
but it has not been selected for next

551
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,799
nist route so maybe we are

552
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,559
switching to hudiak also a key

553
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,158
generation function based on it

554
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,678
and the edwards curve digital signature

555
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,559
algorithm that i already mentioned

556
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,559
for efficient small signatures next

557
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,679
so uh to test all this we are using the

558
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
open source core network emulator that

559
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,440
we also have

560
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,360
updated to include latest version of

561
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,120
python test suits so that we can check

562
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,080
that all the new features are working

563
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,279
and the

564
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:06,000
base exchange works and in general

565
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:07,760
code is operational next please

566
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,159
in this picture for example you can see

567
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,360
the heap version 2 base exchange

568
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,840
completing with

569
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,799
new crypto um yuck cipher

570
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,399
so this is like prerequisite to have

571
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,918
this feature when we start

572
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:28,158
adding trust into the remote id

573
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,159
or provide transport for network id

574
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,559
next please so

575
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,200
for the drip implementation we want to

576
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,799
start with

577
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,200
uh implementation of broadcast drone id

578
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,879
using bluetooth orifi where we just

579
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,279
assign this

580
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,960
post identity tag in hierarchical way

581
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,799
and for development platform it's a

582
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,399
raspberry pi

583
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,879
304 with gps receiver a very limited

584
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,120
space

585
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
something like 20 bytes to include into

586
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,959
the

587
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,399
broadcast messages and to develop

588
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,279
android application

589
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,080
that people can can see which are drones

590
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,159
offline

591
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,399
nearby and maybe in future use as a

592
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,279
gateway for network id

593
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,799
and we started with this us redraft zero

594
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,120
one which explains why

595
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,600
our uh orchid version is a bit outdated

596
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
next one

597
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,120
so for android application um

598
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,240
for open drone id it supported only

599
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,360
bluetooth

600
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,080
so far uh but we wanted to try

601
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,439
wi-fi first because we didn't have like

602
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,000
bluetooth dongle

603
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,720
and we took this wi-fi analyzer as like

604
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,360
open source application to start with

605
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
and um it proved to be a bit challenging

606
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,439
because actually

607
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,960
uh to get some data from the drone you

608
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,159
need to connect to it as

609
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,520
access point and then like

610
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,520
try to figure out what is it

611
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,240
broadcasting so it's uh

612
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,559
as uh next slide will show it's a bit

613
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,039
tricky in practice

614
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,039
next slide

615
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,080
so um currently we are reading this

616
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,320
ssids of wi-fi

617
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,918
drones and try to identify them this way

618
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
in future maybe using wi-fi

619
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,279
neighbor neighborhood aware networking

620
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,678
mode would will be

621
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,399
like more practical because uh in

622
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,200
current mode

623
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,760
you basically need to root your android

624
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,440
device

625
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,080
and it it's not uh corresponding to the

626
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,240
model when

627
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,520
a user just installs something from up

628
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,640
uh play store

629
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,120
and see let's see the drone so it's uh

630
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,279
uh but on the other hand this nine mode

631
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,559
it requires hardware support from wi-fi

632
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,880
chip and also

633
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,600
maybe updating the android version so

634
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,240
maybe it's

635
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
also a bit challenging at least in the

636
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,360
short

637
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:54,158
slide so in this

638
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,199
slide you can see a prototype of wi-fi

639
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
listening and

640
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,360
displaying access points which are like

641
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,960
flying drones in in this our current

642
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,840
prototype

643
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,559
but since it's kind of hard and

644
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,240
implement without rooting so maybe wi-fi

645
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,279
is not the best option for

646
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,720
using this broadcast remote id and that

647
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,440
might be explains also why

648
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,960
open drone id and the adams prototype

649
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,799
has not been using it

650
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,080
so now we are switching to bluetooth

651
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,879
because it seems to be easier and

652
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,439
does not require this rooting problem

653
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,440
next slide

654
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,199
so currently we started to look at the

655
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,039
back performance

656
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
in bluetooth and there are different

657
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,919
versions

658
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,279
so this is even like bluetooth low

659
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
energy but

660
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,200
i think for for drones it makes sense to

661
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,918
use regular bluetooth because we need

662
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,559
the

663
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,159
bigger range and also it's uh not so

664
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,200
critical on the battery i mean

665
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,120
drones operate max few hours so

666
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
it's not like a sensor that needs to

667
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,600
save battery for for

668
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,840
for i don't know weeks or years so

669
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,840
maybe it'll switch to the standard next

670
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
slide

671
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,080
but so far we found bluetooth much

672
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,200
better to and

673
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,480
easier to work with than than wifi

674
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,000
so there are already several

675
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,679
applications available that we

676
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,679
are working to to improve on and uh

677
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,279
bluetooth flow energy range is not that

678
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,159
big around 50 meters but

679
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,039
uh i think in adams experiments they

680
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,120
reached about

681
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,000
100 meters total to 4 and 500 4.25 so we

682
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,279
are looking

683
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,600
also to achieve this kind of ranges

684
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,600
slide

685
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,480
so that's basically it so we are aiming

686
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,760
to complete

687
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,120
complete like a full version of um

688
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,879
uh remote broadcast id

689
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,000
with uh bluetooth and wi-fi by end of

690
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
this year

691
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
so now we are working to update their

692
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
kit implementation

693
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,320
of hit to 2.5

694
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,519
also uh take hodjak latest cipher

695
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,559
and update to the latest air id04

696
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,519
implementation hopefully we also have uh

697
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,279
time to to try on a real flying platform

698
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:24,080
like attach some raspberry pi

699
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:27,279
and gps to uh phantom four tron

700
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,840
and in future i'm already defining for

701
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,320
the spring terms some physics topics and

702
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,439
projects

703
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,480
also for remote id and maybe

704
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,919
bringing implementing claims and

705
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,000
having trust into the hit

706
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,000
so that's it any questions

707
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,879
well thank you that's um that's very

708
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,158
nice to see

709
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,159
things flying i would say

710
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:59,120
any comment any questions

711
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,840
hearing none i think we can move to the

712
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,840
next presentation

713
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
um

714
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,440
so um perhaps adam you could take over

715
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,880
um note taking for the moment while i

716
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,880
present the next few slides

717
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,440
so we've had some activity beyond

718
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,799
writing drafts is my audio going out uh

719
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,640
clearly

720
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,918
yeah okay great oh astm

721
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,919
the the overall uh uas committee f-38

722
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,600
met in the first week of november

723
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,799
um but the uas remote id

724
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,158
working group within f38 did not meet as

725
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,279
part of the big

726
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,159
plenary meetings because the agreement

727
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,279
remains

728
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,320
that the f-3411 updates will wait until

729
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,560
the faa publishes their final rule the

730
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,359
uh uas redworking group did have an

731
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,599
interim meeting

732
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,560
they're very friendly to our few small

733
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,079
requests but

734
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,839
all mods not just ours are in the

735
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,119
backlog iko's trust framework people

736
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,639
are also um accepting our inputs in a

737
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,480
very friendly way they've made some

738
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,159
substantial revisions to their documents

739
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,040
based upon our inputs

740
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
um i've mostly been working lately with

741
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
the

742
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,119
the people who are doing the use cases

743
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,719
that's the tron working group

744
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,639
and then that gets um turned into

745
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,638
identity standards by the di working

746
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,079
group and then a network by the grain

747
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,639
working group and bob has been more

748
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
active in

749
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,320
in those but he indicated to me uh

750
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,159
earlier today that

751
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
that that's been a little bit quiet in

752
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,560
the last few weeks

753
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,078
we've had a number of interactions with

754
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,560
various us

755
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,960
agencies starting with uh faa of course

756
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,240
all the other agencies besides the faa

757
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,960
are waiting to see

758
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,720
what the faa publishes in december and

759
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,800
the faa claims that they are on track to

760
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,879
publish in december

761
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,079
and the the rumor is that they're

762
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,320
flipping from

763
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,680
network remote id to broadcast remote id

764
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,040
as the baseline and that would be fairly

765
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,720
disruptive to what a lot of people have

766
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,880
been assuming

767
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,640
there was a lot of interest in what's

768
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,760
variously called blue force tracking or

769
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,839
iff

770
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,839
which leads to interest in resilience

771
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,560
against spoofing which drip

772
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,160
provides

773
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,359
in the utm pilot project 2

774
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,879
we showed multi-vendor uss uss

775
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,319
interoperability

776
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,000
with you know key functions including

777
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,480
both forms of remote id uh remain

778
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,079
range of the broadcast remote id remains

779
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,200
a concern

780
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,800
and the faa in their nprm

781
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,720
said don't use um

782
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
unmanned aircraft registration numbers

783
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,399
as the uas id type and they gave their

784
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,440
reasoning for not wanting to do that but

785
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,680
in upp two

786
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,359
the faa said do correlation queries into

787
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,000
our database and what you must use as a

788
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,319
key

789
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,400
is the ua registration number so the faa

790
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,760
needs to sort some things out internally

791
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,119
and i want to quickly flip through the

792
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,119
next four slides very quickly

793
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
so you've all seen this before i just

794
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,880
wanted you to see

795
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,119
what we said to the federal agencies and

796
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,800
how we set it and i don't see any point

797
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,160
in drilling into it right now

798
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,040
people can look at this slide later if

799
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,040
they want to next slide

800
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,560
and we had a lot of slides like this

801
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
that you've seen before

802
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,759
now you see the fine print under the red

803
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
cannot be spoofed of course there is no

804
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,680
such

805
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,200
thing as a system that can't be spoofed

806
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,799
but we think that to spoof this

807
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,720
you need to have a little tiny quantum

808
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,240
computer

809
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,078
and this was very popular with the

810
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,520
federal agencies

811
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
and the point is that this is the first

812
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,119
thing that we do above and beyond astm

813
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,119
f3411 next slide

814
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,200
so this is what it looked like we did a

815
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,078
we did a

816
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,000
scenario where we had operators alice

817
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
bob and carol and we had observers doug

818
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,200
and eve

819
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,480
and there was a several step scenario

820
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,598
and we showed that if the sender has

821
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,359
only baseline

822
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,000
astm or if the observer

823
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,240
the receiver has only baseline astm then

824
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,440
you cannot disambiguate between spoofers

825
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,839
and real folks

826
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,359
but if both the sender and the

827
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,240
observer's receiver

828
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,799
have our trustworthy extensions then yay

829
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,439
verily

830
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,800
you can disambiguate a spoofer from the

831
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,720
real deal

832
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,240
next slide oh the the picture in the

833
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,919
middle is adam's app yep

834
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,640
okay so it's really nifty so way forward

835
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,320
uh registries big open area uh this

836
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,879
really needs to be hit hard

837
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,800
um we have talked about crowdsourced

838
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,720
grid feeding broadcast into network we

839
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,040
need to start prototyping that

840
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,919
and then we need to start leveraging um

841
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,200
drip

842
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
to enable the things beyond you know id

843
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,640
as an end

844
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,839
itself things where id is instead a

845
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,520
means to various

846
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,119
ends and so you know making the sender

847
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,480
trustworthy not just the communications

848
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,920
trustworthy but the origin of the

849
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
communications trustworthy

850
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,520
would be um an obvious next step and

851
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,720
then we need to start thinking about

852
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,160
what happens

853
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,078
you know on beyond that with

854
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,000
intermittently networked autonomous uas

855
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,000
and i believe that was my last slide

856
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
so anyway a lot of interest from u.s

857
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,960
federal agencies

858
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,560
i can't say what the europeans or

859
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,800
anybody else may be thinking at this

860
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,920
point we kind of need some champions

861
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,640
to you know to put this forward to easa

862
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,599
and other caas around the world other

863
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,078
regulators

864
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,320
and and um you know not just the faa

865
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,880
thanks i'm done

866
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,200
okay so what you're saying what you said

867
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,400
in the beginning was um

868
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,919
that the broadcast mode is um is

869
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,640
prioritized or

870
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,880
they completely get rid of the network

871
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,879
mode

872
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,920
they're just well okay so this is all

873
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,919
rumor because the faa

874
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,000
rule writers are not allowed to talk to

875
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,440
anybody else even other federal agencies

876
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,920
while they're writing a rule

877
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,160
but the rumor is that they are

878
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
abandoning the concept of network remote

879
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,118
id

880
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,720
now i've gone on record with the federal

881
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
agencies as saying that's not going to

882
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,279
happen because even if there's no

883
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,160
network remote id

884
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,320
by name there will nonetheless within

885
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,960
the scope of utm

886
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,560
be functions that are essentially the

887
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,560
equivalent of network remote id

888
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,799
okay any question

889
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,560
so one last question for me but does it

890
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,000
mean that the drone

891
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,320
and a provider will not establish

892
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,320
a tls or ipsec session

893
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,640
right uh broadcast remote id is um

894
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,960
a link layer phenomenon that is

895
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:15,118
not udp but very udp like

896
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,400
okay okay right thank you

897
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,560
good to know um

898
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,560
i suggest we move to the next

899
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,400
presentation

900
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,400
um let me try

901
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,359
which is

902
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:41,119
adam yes

903
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,880
and and and

904
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,880
is that the certificate at the station

905
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,520
yes

906
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,879
oh there it is there we go

907
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,680
pardon the cheeky name i worked

908
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,200
i worked it's 3 10 a.m for me so i've

909
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,480
been working on this the past couple

910
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,118
days so my

911
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,240
mind turned to mush uh so i'm going to

912
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,480
just talk about

913
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,839
claims assertions attestations and

914
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,880
certificates

915
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,240
oh my next slide please so

916
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,200
small recap this was first off the draft

917
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,319
that this is

918
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,040
pulling from was rewritten massively it

919
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,440
got switched from xml to markdown

920
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,480
i've started to call it drip proofs but

921
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,880
that's kind of

922
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,359
me talking out of wherever i'm talking

923
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,319
but uh stu started a conversation on the

924
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:40,000
list

925
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,480
uh because he was realizing that there

926
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,440
was a lot of people getting confused

927
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,040
because we were throwing the term

928
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,560
certificate around we were throwing the

929
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,720
term claim around

930
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,560
and then the word attestation started

931
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,160
getting thrown around

932
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,920
and he started a email chain in the list

933
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,160
to be like what do we mean by these

934
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,680
terms there were some great responses

935
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,200
from carsten michael richardson hank

936
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,799
bob and michael pelage but it was clear

937
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,240
just from the conversation that we

938
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,280
needed to put a stake in the ground and

939
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,000
we needed to

940
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,800
define these terms how drip was going to

941
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,319
use them

942
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,680
and give some examples so this

943
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:23,759
presentation's kind of me after reading

944
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,560
the emails about 7 000 times

945
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,720
what i saw and how it fits into what

946
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,720
drip is doing so this is my proposed

947
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,919
way of going forward with it because

948
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,759
it's important it

949
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,599
touches the claims draft it touches the

950
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
auth formats draft it touches the

951
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,040
registry draft which hasn't been written

952
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,160
yet but is going to be and is the next

953
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
thing on my list

954
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
along with bob and michael pelage and

955
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,640
also the uas draft

956
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,640
next slide

957
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,240
okay so we'll start

958
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,560
simple there's claims and there's

959
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,160
assertions claims are a predicate

960
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,040
consisting of two elements this comes

961
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,839
from a definition i think stew

962
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,040
um put into the list um there are some

963
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:14,078
examples there

964
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:16,480
x owns y x is y x belongs to y

965
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,520
um and a little hints of what it looks

966
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,880
like in drip

967
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,119
and an assertion is a grouping of one or

968
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,560
more claims

969
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,560
uh by a given entity next slide please

970
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,118
so here's an example of a claim this was

971
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,000
something that bob pointed out

972
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,359
in his email a hierarchical host

973
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,720
identity tag

974
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,520
is an assertion slash

975
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,399
claim i'd argue it's an assertion it has

976
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,119
a bunch of claims

977
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,640
in it as you can see in the color-coded

978
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,040
portion at the bottom

979
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,759
we have a claim of i have a unique

980
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,079
identity

981
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,319
or a unique hash that points to a key

982
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,560
pair and i have a unique

983
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,599
registry that i belong to that's a

984
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,000
pairing of a

985
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,400
rra and an h an raa and an hda

986
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,400
you could also extend the claims to be

987
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,599
oh well i'm using this prefix and i'm

988
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,200
using this oga

989
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,480
id and these are the claims that the

990
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,919
hit asserts

991
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,400
but that's all it is it's just an

992
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,800
assertion of i'm i'm in this registry

993
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,920
and i have this identity which is

994
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,720
64 bits of entropy

995
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,720
next slide please

996
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,560
so we move to the next piece attestation

997
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,920
and certificate

998
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,119
an attestation is a signed assertion

999
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,480
it can be signed by anybody uh

1000
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:50,000
in drip scenario it would most likely be

1001
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,359
signed by the party that

1002
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,880
owns or claims to own said

1003
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:59,598
assertion so they have the

1004
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,280
uh associated private key pair public

1005
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,640
private key pair that the hit

1006
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,119
points to and you sign against it

1007
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,000
or anything else that you want and use

1008
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:11,359
the hit as

1009
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,400
a key to get in um

1010
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,359
the minimum is a hierarchical hit hi

1011
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,040
pairing

1012
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,799
the host identity pairing you can also

1013
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,680
use it to bind relationships between

1014
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,280
different parties

1015
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,680
using other pieces the second

1016
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,720
thing is certificates so a certificate

1017
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,759
is

1018
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,319
by stu's definition that i kind of

1019
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,119
took and i think is a generalization of

1020
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,240
what carsten

1021
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,359
and hank and michael were going after is

1022
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,279
it is signed by a third party and that's

1023
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,119
the critical thing a certificate is

1024
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,640
something that a third party is

1025
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,280
attesting to

1026
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:52,240
and for drip it is mostly identities

1027
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,040
um we could narrow this further to be a

1028
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,759
trusted third party aka the registry

1029
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,680
though i think that gets us in a very

1030
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,440
weird situation where we're saying oh

1031
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,960
it's a trusted third party but then how

1032
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,400
do you trust it i don't wanna go down

1033
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,119
that rabbit hole

1034
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,599
so it's a thought but i don't think we

1035
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,520
need to

1036
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,359
go there unless the working group thinks

1037
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,720
we do

1038
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:16,319
next slide please so this is i'm sorry

1039
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,399
if it's small

1040
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,160
the slides are available so you can blow

1041
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,520
this up to see it a little bit better

1042
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,680
these are the um examples

1043
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,520
of attestations and certificates the

1044
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,560
structures that are defined

1045
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,720
in the identity claims draft so a

1046
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,160
typical attestation is a hierarchical

1047
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,078
host identity tag

1048
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,520
it's a corresponding higher host

1049
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,160
identity a

1050
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,240
expiration timestamp signing timestamp

1051
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,118
and the 64 byte signature

1052
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,799
that's at the max the minimum would be

1053
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,400
the hierarchical host identity tag

1054
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,560
an expiration time stamp and a signature

1055
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:57,839
certificates embed

1056
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:00,799
these attestations so c x x

1057
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:01,200
c x x and c y y in these examples is

1058
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,560
wrong

1059
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,240
it should be a x and a y y

1060
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,680
because it would use the things on the

1061
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,799
left

1062
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,078
in those place marks and a third party

1063
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,240
would sign against

1064
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:19,119
those to assert and to attest to

1065
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,879
the entities owning it with time stamps

1066
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,880
and expiration time stamps

1067
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,160
and there's varying forms of this making

1068
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:30,160
it shorter changing the fields

1069
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,160
removing fields etc

1070
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,439
next slide please

1071
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,960
so this is the proposed flow in drip

1072
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,599
using the provisioning process as a

1073
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,440
guide

1074
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,359
so the registry the aircraft and the

1075
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,400
operator would create attestations on

1076
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,680
themselves

1077
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,000
uh i'm going to be root and say these

1078
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,200
are

1079
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,240
r ah and o

1080
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:56,640
but it's a-r-r-a-a-a and a-o-o

1081
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,439
the operator creates a certificate for

1082
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,759
the relationship

1083
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,640
between itself and an aircraft this

1084
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,200
would be

1085
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,720
coa so the term doesn't actually change

1086
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,240
it's still a certificate

1087
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,640
and the registry would use aoo to create

1088
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:14,319
a certificate between itself and the

1089
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,839
operator with cro

1090
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:18,800
um and the registry would at least use

1091
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,839
coa

1092
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:25,119
a certificate on the certificate regis

1093
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:28,240
operator on aircraft to create

1094
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,800
croa and what

1095
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,680
we've been calling cra for a long time

1096
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,640
now which

1097
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,000
bob is now starting to call the offline

1098
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,520
attestation

1099
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,160
certificate and this actually changes a

1100
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,559
little bit

1101
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,558
so let's go to the next slide

1102
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:51,200
so we had a discussion

1103
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,960
me and bob because bob realized that

1104
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,839
there was a timing attack or there was a

1105
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,760
replay attack

1106
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,839
on the certificate that we were actually

1107
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,520
using and that we've been demonstrating

1108
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,319
for the past couple months

1109
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,640
and that is that it can just be replayed

1110
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:05,839
and

1111
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,879
this is his proposed fix to it i see

1112
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,599
where he's coming from

1113
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,720
i think it's a good idea um so the top

1114
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,359
portion

1115
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,480
uh is created by the registry it uses

1116
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,839
coa

1117
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:21,040
to glean the pieces and create

1118
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:24,160
this attestation

1119
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,880
structure of the identity of the

1120
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,040
registry

1121
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,800
the identity of the aircraft the hi of

1122
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,839
the aircraft and the timing

1123
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,079
and expiration time stamp over

1124
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,960
being signed over to be like the

1125
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,440
registry

1126
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,280
approves that this aircraft uses this id

1127
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,920
and this hi to do

1128
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,839
whatever it's doing and then live on the

1129
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
aircraft with every authentication

1130
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,920
message being sent

1131
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,599
which is a cert message well what we

1132
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,240
call a certain message right now

1133
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,319
the aircraft would add in another

1134
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,000
timestamp assigning timestamp or current

1135
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:59,040
or expiration timestamp

1136
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,559
and another 64 bytes worth of signature

1137
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,079
which is created by signing the entire

1138
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:08,640
uh upper structure and the four byte new

1139
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,640
timestamp

1140
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:16,319
the question um well

1141
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,559
uh can you go back daniel sorry so

1142
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,359
i believe that the upper portion will be

1143
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:22,960
defined in the

1144
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:24,480
identity claims it might get defined in

1145
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,599
the registry draft that has yet been

1146
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,200
written i do not know

1147
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,119
for now it will be in the identity

1148
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,118
claims draft

1149
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,720
the lower portion is going to be defined

1150
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,520
in the auth formats draft i know that

1151
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,118
for certain

1152
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,800
so that will we have to make some

1153
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,640
amendments there um

1154
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,559
i have an open question is this a

1155
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,720
certificate or an attestation

1156
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,240
the whole structure i know that upper

1157
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,720
bid is an attestation

1158
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,439
definitely because it fits with the

1159
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,680
definition

1160
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,280
but what's the whole thing is the whole

1161
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,598
thing a certificate or is it

1162
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,520
an attestation because it's the aircraft

1163
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,960
signing i'm not sure

1164
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,759
so i think it's an attestation and i

1165
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,359
think

1166
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,040
bob is right in saying it's an

1167
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,960
attestation as well

1168
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,880
but i'd like some feedback on the work

1169
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,000
from the working group on this

1170
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,280
because i'm not a hundred percent sure

1171
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,119
how it what bin it falls under

1172
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,119
it doesn't matter to me it's just the

1173
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:20,400
text of what i use

1174
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,400
uh next slide daniel

1175
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,279
okay so what needs to change so in the

1176
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,079
identity claims draft specifically what

1177
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,200
needs to change is section 1.1

1178
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,599
1.1 is where currently i defined all

1179
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,439
four

1180
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,440
terms i need to make sure that they line

1181
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,960
up with what i've just discussed here

1182
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:40,640
and with examples as needed um i need to

1183
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,119
change all the terms around to say

1184
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,078
search change certificate to attestation

1185
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,079
where it needs to

1186
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,359
and attestation to certificate where it

1187
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,160
needs to

1188
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,558
um and change some of these short names

1189
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,160
or

1190
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:56,559
friendly names to some of the structures

1191
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,279
um i believe the offline form is a good

1192
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,640
name

1193
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,720
it might just be called offline

1194
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,680
attestation to match with what bob was

1195
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,200
going with

1196
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,960
and i need to prefix the provisioning

1197
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,480
section so that all the naming

1198
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,000
conventions flow through the whole

1199
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,559
document

1200
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,559
next slide

1201
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,040
so other to-do's this is kind of

1202
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:20,558
overarching for

1203
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,960
me so that the working group kind of

1204
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:25,200
knows where i'm going

1205
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,800
with a lot of the work i'm doing um so

1206
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,759
first off is the authentication formats

1207
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,520
draft

1208
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,160
obviously i need to update that if i

1209
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,759
update the identity claims

1210
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,279
i need to update the structures there to

1211
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,839
make sure that everything aligns and

1212
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,200
isn't

1213
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:40,640
being fragmented um

1214
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,480
i need to start working on a registry

1215
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,558
drive for bob we've been discussing this

1216
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,160
i'm getting in touch with michael polage

1217
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,000
me and bob and michael

1218
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,839
will be sitting down hopefully in a week

1219
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,200
or two

1220
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,440
to discuss some things

1221
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,279
i have to continue the ax implementation

1222
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,200
which is still unfortunately closed

1223
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,640
source

1224
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,720
i'm working on that fingers crossed

1225
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,319
um i still haven't switched to the newer

1226
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,040
off style it's still on the old off

1227
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:09,520
style

1228
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,319
um it got frozen due to the many demos

1229
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,800
that stu

1230
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:14,640
actually briefed i didn't want to change

1231
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,359
anything too suddenly and

1232
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,720
make um things explode in front of a

1233
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:21,759
customer's face

1234
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,680
uh next slide

1235
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,680
i think that's it yeah that is it so

1236
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,200
here's a nice little xkcd comic which is

1237
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,520
becoming a

1238
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,040
growing trend with me any questions

1239
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,880
comments or concerns

1240
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,759
either raise them on the list bring them

1241
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,640
here i'd be more than happy to answer

1242
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,640
anything i need to

1243
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:43,839
jonathan

1244
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,400
hi could you go to slide four please

1245
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:08,800
so in uh in claim one

1246
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:11,598
you say uh enzione's unique id

1247
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,000
um yes yeah unique i'm not quite sure

1248
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,240
what this

1249
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,599
can't be claimed or sorry uniqueness can

1250
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:21,520
be cleaned uniqueness can't be proven

1251
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,359
so it seems like strange thing to define

1252
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,280
so i think this ties into a little bit

1253
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:26,078
what the registry does because the

1254
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
registry

1255
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,640
would get it an age hit and then check

1256
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,000
in the listing of eight hits that are

1257
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,359
available

1258
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,880
of oh is this unique within my scope the

1259
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:42,000
hda scope and then the sign

1260
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,359
and the certificate come in to

1261
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,520
claim uh this is a unique id so

1262
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:50,000
the wording i i agree with you is wrong

1263
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,280
here that's not the right term

1264
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,200
i don't remember exactly what i was

1265
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,240
going for thank you for pointing that

1266
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,640
out

1267
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,680
it comes it comes down to the the dance

1268
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,558
with the registry

1269
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,558
wow the you know the ua creates a

1270
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,040
hierarchical hit for itself

1271
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,799
it creates a key pair and then it hashes

1272
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,480
it and then creates the hierarchical hit

1273
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:13,520
and then it asks the registry the hda

1274
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:16,720
i have this new 128 byte thing

1275
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,839
can i use this to be who i am can i use

1276
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,078
this as my name

1277
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:22,078
as my identifier and the registry gets

1278
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,920
the final say of saying

1279
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,599
no someone's already taken that that's

1280
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,760
already in my list

1281
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,119
or yeah that's yours now here's a

1282
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,119
certificate claiming

1283
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:32,480
or an attestation how whatever the term

1284
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:36,160
we use to say

1285
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:39,119
yup this is yours you can have it

1286
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,640
so wording needs to be worked out thank

1287
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,280
you for pointing that out i'd be

1288
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:44,879
happy to get some wording from you if

1289
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,920
you have an idea of what needs to be

1290
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,599
there

1291
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:53,839
for the wording i'll see you all right

1292
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,839
thanks thank you

1293
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:02,640
anybody else any other question comment

1294
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,480
med to move to the next slot because we

1295
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,839
are running out of time so

1296
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,640
uh bob can jump in

1297
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,640
thanks everyone hello

1298
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:21,680
hope i'm coming through i hope so too

1299
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:23,680
okay because it's just reloaded

1300
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:26,640
okay i'm gonna have to go fast here so

1301
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,078
let's go on the next slide

1302
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,920
and this draft has been around for a

1303
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,760
while

1304
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,799
this is from the drip charter why we're

1305
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,799
doing this let's go on

1306
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,440
privacy to whom and that is to the

1307
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,200
observer what whether they should know

1308
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,079
or not no let's go on

1309
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,520
um the problem statement is that in the

1310
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,960
standard messages

1311
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:53,040
there is uas operator pai and

1312
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,880
uh something needs to be done about that

1313
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:59,839
to fight to meet

1314
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:03,280
pai regulations go on

1315
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:06,558
um who should have access pai the uss

1316
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:10,000
for the ua authorized entities um

1317
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,599
no whom and so forth others

1318
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,960
but we do need to protect we do need to

1319
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:15,760
encrypt the api that's coming with the

1320
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,760
broadcast go on

1321
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,640
um so how to encrypt the pei um the us

1322
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,799
should have business relations with some

1323
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,960
uss in fact that's basic requirement

1324
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,960
thus they can establish a symmetric key

1325
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:31,200
for encrypting the pai

1326
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,880
with authorized entities able to access

1327
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,839
ask the uss

1328
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,240
for either the pi directly or for the

1329
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,839
key

1330
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,879
for ongoing real-time access to the

1331
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:44,640
information and

1332
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,960
so on um so let's go next slide here

1333
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:49,920
so the symmetric cipher must encrypt

1334
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,559
without expanding clear text that's hard

1335
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,200
no bites to spare they would encrypt

1336
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,040
multiple

1337
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,799
messages the operator id message

1338
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,799
operator location

1339
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,240
in multiple system messages obviously

1340
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:01,680
that operator can move

1341
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,520
a foot and all of a sudden their

1342
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,118
location changes

1343
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,520
so be able to do this in the

1344
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:11,440
high constraints i think michael st

1345
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,200
johnson will point me to a solution

1346
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,520
going on michael st john's is very

1347
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,558
simple ascfb

1348
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,240
uh with a small uh with this with

1349
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,760
whatever your block is in this case

1350
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,000
cfv 32 with the hidden iv

1351
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,960
and this metric key derived by a hybrid

1352
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,920
ecis

1353
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,839
scheme handled by when the operation is

1354
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,680
registered

1355
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:37,680
and key duration function is now

1356
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,879
included in this last graph using

1357
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,919
kmac so this is using in many ways

1358
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,520
standard components asc fb 32 is well

1359
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,520
defined

1360
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,880
and how to handle the ib and the rest of

1361
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,920
it

1362
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,359
the the key duration yes i am using kmac

1363
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,799
but again this is all

1364
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:56,799
standard pieces going on

1365
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,040
um the uh i said this the

1366
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,359
cypher feedback allows for variable

1367
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,520
length block sizes like 32 bits

1368
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:10,319
i chose 32 bits because that's a size

1369
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:12,559
that fits with the fields

1370
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:16,079
and smaller size might lead to crypto

1371
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:18,079
tag against small location changes

1372
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:20,559
the unique id is not needed for each

1373
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:22,240
application of cfp

1374
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,160
so again it's it's just a good

1375
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,240
cryptographic fit i did get a couple

1376
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:29,359
bruises on the cfrg list

1377
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,359
coming to this conclusion

1378
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,359
now when to encrypt um behind this the

1379
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,400
the pi

1380
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,759
must be conditional um only when allowed

1381
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,079
by the uss

1382
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,440
um only when the uas has connection to

1383
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,960
the uss

1384
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,040
um and otherwise uh if you have don't

1385
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,119
mean let's uh let's do the encryption

1386
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,279
but there are limitations to this and

1387
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,359
that must be put into the protocol

1388
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,960
and the recognition all that is it text

1389
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:56,960
is in the draft continue

1390
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,720
um i did look at alternative cfp there's

1391
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,480
a fiso scheme

1392
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,759
it's slow but pretty neat um probably

1393
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,960
asctrs we needed two bytes in the

1394
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,799
message for a counter

1395
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:13,040
and there's no two bytes available um

1396
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:14,079
and i've spent quite a bit of time in

1397
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,720
the cfrg list

1398
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,839
on this um there might be an alternative

1399
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,680
coming from the nist

1400
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,119
lightweight crypto but that's not for

1401
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,240
another year yet

1402
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:28,000
so that's why i'm staying with cfbs

1403
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:31,680
32 for now continue

1404
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,440
um so again carmen's met is privacy one

1405
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:38,240
and two confidential handling

1406
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,240
and encrypted transport can you

1407
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,640
and read the draft it's been out there

1408
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,599
and i'd like to see a drop

1409
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,640
adapted adopted by the work group for

1410
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:50,079
for this this is

1411
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,598
currently the only pai in the estm

1412
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:55,760
messages

1413
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:58,160
that may change with the final

1414
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:59,440
making and and changes to it for

1415
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,279
instance the

1416
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,119
operator location does not save the

1417
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,440
operators elevation

1418
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,640
is that the guy on the third floor

1419
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,520
balcony or the fourth floor

1420
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,160
balcony um but that's that's easily

1421
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,720
handled

1422
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,399
um because that would just be handling

1423
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,759
eight um eight bytes in and

1424
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,200
works in this model so uh i like to see

1425
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,440
this adopted

1426
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:27,118
um and uh so let's go i'm out of time

1427
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,920
um and so i'll take questions offline i

1428
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,240
think jonathan's up there

1429
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,240
okay

1430
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,839
i'm just a hangover from the last cube

1431
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:50,000
okay so are we done now

1432
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:52,400
that's it i have that's all i have

1433
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,680
okay we don't have much time for

1434
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,680
questions

1435
01:01:53,680 --> 01:02:01,279
so because i

1436
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:05,359
i am tempted to adjourn that meeting

1437
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:08,400
um unless we have a last minute question

1438
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,400
last minute comment

1439
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,558
in any case please um provide your

1440
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,440
comment questions

1441
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,839
on the mailing list and we will plan

1442
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,520
some

1443
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:35,839
interim meetings thank you everyone and

1444
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:35,839
see you at the plenary

1445
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,520
you
