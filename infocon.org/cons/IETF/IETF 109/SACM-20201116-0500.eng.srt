um and uh

47
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,080
we don't particularly need a jabber

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,799
scribe

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,360
the jabber is integrated into the meat

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,640
echo tool that we are all using

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,480
um and i

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,958
don't i don't know if there's any agenda

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,959
bashing

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
um

55
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
okay uh so with that

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,518
in the terms of the the roley

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,599
configuration checklist stuff

58
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,120
it appears that my name got drafted on

59
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,159
there um

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,599
i i was uh i i was under the impression

61
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
that steven was going to be given the

62
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
update on that

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,920
so if uh somebody else that

64
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,599
stephen works with is on and they know a

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,839
little bit more about it than i do

66
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:55,200
um i can give a three second update

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,599
otherwise it's not too much

68
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,119
okay i was just last time i put steven's

69
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
name on it and they told me to put your

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,080
name on it so

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
this time i put your name on it i make

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,519
them yeah sure

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,680
um but i don't see stephen or

74
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,799
um or gabe on here either so

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,959
yeah either

76
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,959
either one of them all right

77
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,959
thank you um

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
so the next thing is document status i

79
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,639
went ahead and put the epcp on

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,280
here because we had a virtual interim

81
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
a little less than a month ago and at

82
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,119
that virtual interim we decided to stop

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
work on that

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
and we had a discussion for the

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
rationale for that um

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,040
but the chairs were supposed to send a

87
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,799
follow-up email to the mailing list

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,199
which in reviewing the minutes i

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,840
realized that we had not done

90
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,040
so earlier this evening i sent that

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,320
follow-up email to the mailing list

92
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,320
and i've given a

93
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,919
a date of friday so if

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,360
the um the

95
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,960
the rationale if folks are happy with

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,560
um i mean basically the

97
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,080
the idea was that uh jess felt that the

98
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,280
document was no longer needed in the

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,880
community

100
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,638
that the work on the document had

101
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
already informed the work of the working

102
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,960
group

103
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,400
and that any material that needed to be

104
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
incorporated into the architecture

105
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
document where the architecture document

106
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,159
was relying on the epcp

107
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,440
could be moved there and

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,680
uh you know so the other

109
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,880
reason is that there's uh there appears

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,160
to be a fair amount of work that would

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,240
need to be done and we don't really have

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,440
editors for it at this point

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,039
so um

114
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,880
the uh if anybody

115
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
feels that that document does need to be

116
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
progressed i'm looking for both uh

117
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,840
opposition to us parking it and also

118
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
um volunteers for helping to complete it

119
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
so that's why that's still on there if

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,280
you were at the virtual interim and

121
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,560
you're wondering why

122
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:22,000
um the next document uh

123
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,720
is the coastwood document um

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
i know that there has been a lot of work

125
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
uh

126
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,479
done to update this and i'm not sure who

127
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
would like to speak to the current

128
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,520
status of it

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,280
i put hank's name on here because he was

130
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,719
the one that discussed it before

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,719
so i don't know who would like to

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
discuss what the current status of

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,740
addressing all of roman's comments on

134
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:51,440
that is

135
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,599
[Music]

136
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,880
dang it so this is hank hi um

137
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,520
you are audible yes uh hi hello

138
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,360
hello everyone um yeah i saw um there

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,639
was actually feedback from uh

140
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,759
roman my uh night yesterday so this is

141
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,759
my very early morning

142
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:15,199
today um and so uh yeah we have uh

143
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,560
created uh a update as you uh

144
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,360
mentioned um it is rather uh

145
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,639
substantial we addressed all of uh

146
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,639
thomas's uh

147
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,759
comments i think there is this

148
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,039
structural

149
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:33,360
thing to disconnect from the uh switch

150
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,199
um um interoperability semantics

151
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
uh i think we have done that i think

152
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,280
that is the most difficult to check

153
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,720
uh roman uh seems to have liked it uh

154
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,878
roman if you have a comment on that that

155
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
would be uh helpful i think

156
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,680
um the only really open issue is

157
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
actually a rather technical one i think

158
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,680
the other ones are just more leg work

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
that we have not uh were not able to

160
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,440
complete until this

161
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,039
meeting here and this technical one is

162
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,719
the time representation of

163
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,280
uh xsd date and if the uh

164
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
uh seaboard time is actually uh a

165
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,318
appropriate

166
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
thing because we have to convert that i

167
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
think it is

168
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,878
um we might not need the time fraction

169
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,280
here

170
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,840
we can fall back to an uh an inch type

171
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,318
of a time that we can create our own uh

172
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,758
by

173
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:28,160
not using float by uh but the native uh

174
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,680
primitive uh and then there is this uh

175
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,399
this question that we actually did not

176
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
get from roman and i think roman is here

177
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
today

178
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,359
uh which is about the uh extensibility

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,799
features

180
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,080
of sibor to be used here

181
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,040
and that caused a little bit of a

182
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,360
confusion in the attitus group

183
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,040
because we did not really get the

184
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
meaning i think

185
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,319
so roman if you could elaborate on this

186
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
for a second that would be nice i think

187
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
it

188
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,719
might be possible here of her email

189
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
later uh but yeah

190
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,080
that is basically it we are addressing

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
the rest okay i think roman's in the

192
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,040
queue ramen go ahead

193
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,040
uh hey uh hey everyone uh so

194
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,880
uh so top line the thing you first

195
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,839
mentioned heck about the fact that the

196
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,519
new text unwinds coast with and suid

197
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,360
yeah thank you that you guys

198
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,640
the team did a great job unwinding that

199
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,519
that all that text

200
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,519
looks good uh to the point about

201
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,640
extensibility i would have to look at

202
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
exactly what i

203
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,399
said was i poking at extensibility via

204
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
seaboard

205
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
was that the issue yeah i think you did

206
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,080
that is actually

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
i think the the issue here because we we

208
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,200
don't really know

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,399
uh uh we interpreted it that way and uh

210
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,920
but uh it was really hard for us uh

211
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,399
to understand that and let me let me

212
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,959
find that passage it's about um uh

213
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,920
i thought i made a new checklist uh kind

214
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,079
of yesterday i

215
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,199
i i took a subset of my original

216
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,120
feedback i don't remember anything about

217
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,800
extensibility if i did say something i

218
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,680
think i may have just met

219
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,279
give me more words uh yeah it's it's

220
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,399
it's versioning it's versioning

221
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,000
so it's a section sorry

222
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
yeah that was the case so so the

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,480
versioning of

224
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,680
um so so what you think what they think

225
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
you're hinting at is

226
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,120
is including in the instantiation of a

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,360
code switch

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,519
something about which version of the

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
cdda specification which does not have a

230
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
version

231
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
is used here is that correct yeah yeah

232
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,279
so

233
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,000
that's exactly so i was thinking about

234
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,240
this the you know suite to kind of coast

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,240
with in suid i thought that there was an

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,000
explicit version number

237
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,320
right uh yeah it's by the uh

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,360
it's in the name space xsd typically has

239
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
this uh

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
interesting feature let's call it to uh

241
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
uh

242
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
draw in the version number into a

243
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,600
namespace uh

244
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
cdj has neither i'm sorry sorry

245
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,480
it's close but it has neither the still

246
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,120
cause it seems neither this is better

247
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,720
sorry

248
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
right yeah and so all i'm just wondering

249
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
is how to handle

250
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,519
that because again there's i thought

251
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
there was an attempt to have full

252
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
symmetry

253
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,880
so if one has it how would it be handled

254
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,440
i'm not saying it needs an explicit

255
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,399
thing i would just say provide some text

256
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,920
so there is symmetry ah okay yeah we can

257
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,120
do that so it's it's supposed to be

258
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,319
handled by the

259
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,720
uh um extensibility feature so

260
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,680
uh everything that changes over time can

261
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,279
be expressed with

262
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,160
additional uh the specifications have a

263
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,640
semantic

264
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,839
scope and therefore it is defined there

265
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,839
we abstract

266
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,120
from this full symmetry already a little

267
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,959
bit here now and

268
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
this would go into that part that is

269
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,959
also

270
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
detaching itself from that uh there is

271
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,479
uh the assumption is that that uh having

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,680
a

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,279
a a uh more complex uh extensibility

274
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,439
feature like for rims

275
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,439
or for other contexts like like the

276
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,079
evolvement of ice so if it's reflected

277
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
here

278
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,439
uh there will be more than uh one way to

279
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
combine all this uh which is uh

280
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
typically

281
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,480
the thing uh the lane you want to go and

282
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,120
down the small constraint space and the

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
uh

284
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
in the cdl space uh we have a very good

285
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,479
text so i

286
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
i like we can we can explain how this is

287
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,160
not related

288
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,639
relatively important to this new concept

289
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,319
here

290
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,000
and how it is dealt with and how it's

291
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
still working so we will just add more

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,399
text about the

293
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
versioning capabilities of the coast

294
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,279
with spec thank you

295
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,279
perfect thanks

296
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,279
and i think from my part that it is so

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
the rest is actually

298
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,120
so for example expressing the issuing

299
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,200
emails again for for

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
registering some of the items some

301
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
artifacts that are still in there i

302
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,479
think that is all

303
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,800
uh uh still some leg work um

304
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,200
we think we're in a good way here so so

305
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,560
stay tuned i assume this will only

306
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,560
uh looking back on our speed

307
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,319
i think it will take like four to six

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,880
weeks and then we have this all

309
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
uh done

310
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,519
thank you okay all right yeah

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,399
just a quick question which is roman did

312
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,320
you mean that

313
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,839
that you wanted to be able to express

314
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,839
what swed version

315
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,000
a coast with implementation was kind of

316
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,120
compatible with or just a version

317
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
of the coast with i was thinking the

318
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,399
version of the

319
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,399
co switch okay

320
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,639
can you hear me this is dave symmetry

321
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,000
hold on dave just a second

322
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,760
go ahead chris i think that was the

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
the question which was really if you

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,800
were just kind of a versioning of coast

325
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,120
wood that i understood hank's

326
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,079
answer to your question if it was more

327
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
about

328
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,000
you know how the symmetry to to swit

329
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
versions was then

330
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,560
then i don't think we were getting there

331
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,560
but i think we're good

332
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,399
okay i i uh sorry dave i think uh chris

333
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,199
and i are

334
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,519
both clearing the queue at the same time

335
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,319
i see

336
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,880
i just had a just for clarification i'm

337
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
sorry i

338
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
i joined late i was having a hard time

339
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,680
getting connected at first

340
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,120
first meeting of my week um

341
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,040
so as far as like coast with versioning

342
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,199
do we need to have an explicit version

343
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,560
so one of the things that we're doing

344
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,079
in coastwood is we we have a registry

345
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,239
of um of coast with tags and so the idea

346
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,719
is that um as

347
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,440
the syntax of a coast wood were to

348
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,839
change

349
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,880
we we would simply add new tags to that

350
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,240
registry so

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,279
effectively our our change control

352
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,399
um you know with with the model you know

353
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,880
happens through

354
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:59,839
through that tag registry do we do we

355
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,839
need an explicit version

356
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,359
so so from hank's point of view of

357
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,760
course no

358
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,760
but there might be other opinions here

359
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
um

360
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,279
so we we had raised the question a while

361
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,360
back about explicit versioning and um

362
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
you know jim shaw at the time had

363
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,160
actually raised

364
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,880
the concern that um you know all tags

365
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,800
are

366
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,720
you know are numbered and if we simply

367
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,839
add new data you know new

368
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,880
new tags to the to the model

369
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
that would be handled through the

370
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,360
registry and we've been working off of

371
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
that assumption

372
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
you know since since then and and so i'm

373
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,119
wondering is this discussion a change in

374
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,600
that plan

375
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,079
or are we we're keeping with that

376
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,279
approach going forward

377
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,439
i guess i'm mostly concerned with

378
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,880
addressing roman's

379
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,399
a.d feedback reverend do you have

380
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,680
specific concerns that

381
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,040
require versioning uh

382
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,160
so philosophically i guess i envisioned

383
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,279
it if we ever

384
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,240
published let's say coast with one one

385
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,040
one two

386
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
and or you know qo would we have kind of

387
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,160
a new registry

388
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,199
of of the tags so to speak so if i ever

389
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,439
wanted to provide

390
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,599
you know a profile of some kind saying i

391
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,680
expect the following things versus kind

392
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,759
of not because that's my version

393
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,880
of uh that's my version of god of course

394
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,120
with i would

395
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
not have some easy way to know which

396
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,720
version i was expecting

397
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
without something application specific

398
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
but if that's been asked and answered

399
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,120
and we're comfortable

400
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
with that that's fine i was explicitly

401
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,279
trying to catch the fact that

402
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
they're for everything in squid i was

403
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,519
expecting to see some analog

404
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,040
in coast with and this was one of the

405
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,440
things that i caught that didn't have

406
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,360
that

407
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
and so i'm not per se arguing if that's

408
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,600
what the one guru wants that we need to

409
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
put it back in there

410
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,040
i was just saying the way hank was

411
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,560
already already noting that he can drop

412
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,560
the text in is just you know

413
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,920
here is why it's not in there and you

414
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,719
know it's a sentence or two explaining

415
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,519
the situation

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
that it's a different data model yeah i

417
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,280
think i think

418
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,799
okay i got you i'm i'm clear on what on

419
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,160
what's needed there

420
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,319
thanks for the discussion i appreciate

421
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,319
it

422
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,400
yeah and as far as what else is left

423
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
with the draft we have those early

424
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,520
registration

425
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,198
um or the early review requests that you

426
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,119
had asked for um that we need to get

427
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,480
done and there's also i think one small

428
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,039
issue with um adding some text about

429
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,240
size comparisons you know for swift tags

430
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,879
and coast with tags

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,080
um i haven't had a chance to get my

432
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,039
implementation up and

433
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,399
running to do those comparisons so that

434
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,840
should be a pretty quick

435
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
quick thing to do as well

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
that size comparison thing as i put in

437
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,879
my comments last night i mean that's not

438
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
a big deal i think that's super helpful

439
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,840
but

440
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,840
that's pretty much cosmetic yeah

441
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,360
thanks for all the great feedback

442
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
appreciate it yeah so

443
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,479
thank you roman for that actually so it

444
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
was a big list

445
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,600
and it took a look of how to compile it

446
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,600
and again it

447
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,039
it takes us some time to address it but

448
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,159
we are soldering through that and i

449
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,000
think the uh

450
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
the rest is now uh there's light at the

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,360
end of the tunnel here thank you very

452
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,360
much

453
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,039
um i i know we discussed this a little

454
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,120
bit on the virtual interim

455
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
the question was where the magnitude of

456
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,239
the change is going to be enough that we

457
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,520
wanted to do another working group last

458
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,440
call on this document

459
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,960
and i don't know roman if you have an

460
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,520
opinion on that or the authors do

461
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,520
or chris

462
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,840
i mean from my perspective it was a lot

463
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,320
of nits

464
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,360
uh the list was long but i i personally

465
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,480
didn't feel like they

466
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,199
substantially kind of changed what what

467
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
came to me

468
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,559
i think there was just it was a long

469
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
list

470
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,079
okay

471
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,079
[Music]

472
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,840
i have a similar feeling maybe

473
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,240
the question to ask is is there

474
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,159
[Music]

475
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
does anyone find any of the changes to

476
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,039
be you know significant in a way that

477
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,080
they would want to

478
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,400
you know to comment on this

479
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
so i guess the one question from

480
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
reviewing the document is

481
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,679
is about at least in my mind is about uh

482
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,799
the

483
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
the remote attestation seem to be a lot

484
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
more developed

485
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,120
in the draft although it's still just

486
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,559
pointers which i think is

487
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,000
pointers to the document in

488
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,440
rats can anybody comment on

489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,080
on that you know because i feel like

490
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,679
that

491
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,559
could be more significant but it's

492
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,440
actually not clear to me if it is

493
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,559
my perspective is that we we should

494
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,679
break any

495
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,639
any um connection to

496
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,520
you know the work that's ongoing and and

497
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,600
and rats

498
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,918
and simply have that document point back

499
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
to the published coast with spec

500
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,720
um you know when when it works its way

501
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
through the isg

502
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,080
because it's it's a use case for using

503
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,240
coast with you know not something that

504
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,480
is core to

505
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,799
the use of or to the definition of ko

506
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
suite

507
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
but there's almost kind of extension

508
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,678
placeholders for

509
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,400
what is it rim uh yeah you put points in

510
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,080
the current

511
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,559
draft which is a change from from 15 to

512
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,559
16.

513
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,600
i didn't realize that change was made i

514
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,120
also don't see what you mean here right

515
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,799
now so the extension points are all

516
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,879
there they were there before and

517
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:58,158
they are now we didn't add any

518
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,679
but it changed sorry

519
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,280
it's an update of them from kind of

520
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,080
a one sentence you know here's a pointer

521
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,799
to a

522
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,480
to an extension point to here's four i

523
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,600
guess more defined extension points and

524
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,600
i'm not neces

525
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,280
i don't necessarily think that that's

526
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,399
potentially a big change i just

527
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,879
don't fully understand the what it

528
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,880
implies

529
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,000
that the beginning of the document so

530
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
the beginning of the document there's

531
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,400
three use cases uh

532
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,158
to uh uh highlight where this can be

533
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,000
applied and at first there was a

534
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
so you're talking about the um

535
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,720
assessment uh case i assume that

536
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,840
according to the

537
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,080
architecture yeah that was

538
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,360
before before the romans comment was

539
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
about this was

540
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,959
this this document started when there

541
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
was no rats and so it was pointing to

542
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,760
tuda before

543
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,080
uh so a a specific uh the only one

544
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,158
protocol aboard attestation at the time

545
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,360
and now it points to architecture so

546
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
it's it's but it's also talk

547
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
appointed to sam so the software um

548
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,639
assessment management and such so

549
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:12,080
um i'm not really sure uh

550
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,880
how this is uh different now

551
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,879
me see if i can

552
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,280
so i mean if you guys obviously you guys

553
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,000
think it's

554
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,559
it's pretty trivial so uh it might just

555
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,240
be

556
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,720
my lack of uh depth of reading

557
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,120
on part of it so maybe that's a okay

558
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,120
actually

559
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,080
it's simply just an informative

560
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,280
reference to the rats architecture

561
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,600
um if if it's problematic we could

562
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,440
strike it i i would i would say

563
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
i wasn't saying that what i was saying

564
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
is i didn't um

565
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,320
because i thought there were some more

566
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,360
statements to rim

567
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,080
but it's okay so if if i have any

568
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,678
concerns i'll

569
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,678
i'll i'll put it on list thanks

570
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,120
sure but i'm pretty sure we don't have

571
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,000
included any uh

572
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
forward reference so to speak to ramsey

573
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,240
yeah i mean to repeat

574
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,879
the the original text said cuda and i

575
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,559
said use

576
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,640
rats architecture only because that was

577
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,720
more generic and all of them were

578
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
informative references

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,000
i also don't think that there were any

580
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,990
changes

581
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,140
beyond that referencing rats yeah okay

582
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,140
[Music]

583
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,559
okay um anything else on

584
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,559
cuss with

585
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,360
if i recall i i heard that you think

586
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
it'll be

587
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,719
like three or four weeks hank and dave

588
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
yeah

589
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,480
it's more like six to uh four to six but

590
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,840
yes i think that's true

591
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,840
somewhere in that order of magnitude

592
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
though

593
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,799
so it could it could be like um yeah

594
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,080
like a new year's

595
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:04,799
uh surprise how's that

596
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:08,639
that sounds wonderful there you go

597
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:12,400
um okay so nothing else on

598
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,960
coast wood the um next document is the

599
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,080
rolley configuration checklist extension

600
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,080
uh and dave before you join the call uh

601
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,080
i had put bill on here and bill said

602
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,559
well maybe

603
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,240
you or stephen wanted to talk to it and

604
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,440
then you weren't here so i left bill on

605
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080
it and now you're here so i don't know

606
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,320
which one of the two of you wants to uh

607
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,559
talk about the rollie i don't see

608
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,240
stephen i don't believe

609
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,840
i don't see him either i haven't been

610
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,960
working on that draft so i don't

611
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:46,080
have any prepared remarks all right so

612
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:49,919
i'll stick it back to bill

613

yeah this is still i just my my

614
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,080
question and of bringing up your name

615
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,199
was if steven had uh passed any

616
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,879
information on to you

617
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,080
if he was joining or not

618
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,840
um yeah

619
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,840
i have not heard from him

620
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,760
all right um um

621
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,840
i can try to get in touch with him and

622
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,840
um maybe we can come back to this

623
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,639
okay um i i mean i can give the two

624
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,720
minute update

625
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
if you if you want that's yeah the two

626
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,960
minute that'd be great

627
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:30,080
thanks yeah sure um so

628
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,679
uh you know work work is ongoing um

629
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,559
i we the three of us me um

630
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,919
stephen and gabe alford the the main

631
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,440
authors on the draft

632
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,720
are uh we meet bi-weekly um

633
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
it's sort of a combination of uh the

634
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,840
the two of the the two of them really

635
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,559
kind of talking more about

636
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,279
implementations of of rolly that are

637
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,879
going on

638
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:58,799
on either side um as well as the draft

639
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,520
and i know that we were

640
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
waiting for the official adoption of the

641
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,520
draft to

642
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,559
really sort of uh continue to

643
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,559
task people with

644
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,159
kind of completing the different

645
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,919
sections of the draft um

646
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,440
it shouldn't be uh all a huge amount of

647
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,320
effort from the

648
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,360
uh authoring perspective but um again

649
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,200
it's just sort of

650
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,520
uh us getting together and making sure

651
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,840
that we can um

652
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,559
kind of assign people to to work on

653
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,199
stuff

654
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,960
so that's uh that's pretty much it uh

655
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,960
the the updated named

656
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,520
uh adopted version of the draft still

657
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,520
hasn't even been posted on there so

658
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,960
i'll just kind of take those things down

659
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,760
as action items to

660
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
take to the group

661
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,678
okay

662
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,919
well the draft has been uh

663
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:01,440
adopted and you all have published a

664
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,440
uh a working group version at this point

665
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,760
right

666
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:11,520
um it's still listed in the documents as

667
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,840
uh the original sort of eminem named

668
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,679
document so it's not even it's not

669
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,279
listed as

670
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,799
uh draft ietf yet so okay

671
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,919
yeah i'm sorry well i have to get that

672
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,399
updated yeah i i'm sorry i switched it

673
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,399
with um

674
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,240
it is kind of late i switched it with

675
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,600
the in my mind with one that's um

676
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,360
in the ntp working group

677
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:44,559
where they had had done the update so

678
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,559
that's great um okay

679
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:52,240
so uh next

680
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:56,399
is the sac architecture um

681
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,340
we do have let me get these switched out

682
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,600
um

683
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:03,840
[Music]

684
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,120
so uh bill or adam i don't know which

685
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
one of you is going to talk

686
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,320
it's me again all right well i'm just

687
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,360
going to go to your

688
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,439
one slide my huge side yeah um

689
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,039
yeah so i'll just say it's uh pretty

690
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,159
much the same updates that we

691
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,720
represented at the at the interim um no

692
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,880
other

693
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,159
work really has been done on it since

694
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,960
then

695
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,919
again to reiterate we we've addressed

696
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,559
most of

697
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,960
uh if not all uh if they hadn't been

698
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,678
changed already and fixed the iris

699
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,720
comments

700
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,600
uh from the previous

701
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,600
previous reviews um a lot of formatting

702
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,799
improvements in there with uh better

703
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,760
tables and uh descriptive elements and

704
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,600
stuff

705
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,440
um section four got a lot more uh

706
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
fleshed out with a number of the

707
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,399
different component interactions

708
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,919
and um section five

709
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,399
uh got a lot more improvements again

710
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,360
of the different uh you know sort of

711
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,199
topic naming

712
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,158
and outlines of the different operations

713
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
and kind of placeholders for uh the

714
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,960
different

715
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,240
information elements that needed to be

716
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,559
uh put in there for each operation so

717
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
all of those still need to be kind of

718
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
built out with the different data that

719
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,960
would

720
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,240
um kind of be passed through the

721
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
different uh

722
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,640
topics and endpoints um and

723
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,918
again roman did a kind of a very

724
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,240
uh thorough review uh with which

725
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
resulted in a large number of comments

726
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,240
that

727
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
we have not gone through and addressed

728
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,919
yet that would be

729
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,799
in the 08 update and i guess that's

730
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,120
going to

731
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,240
sort of depend on the next steps for the

732
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,678
working group on

733
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,279
what we're going to do with that and how

734
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,840
we're going to move forward with those

735
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:09,840
um i'll let adam fill in any blanks that

736
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:09,840
i might have left out

737
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
adam

738
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:23,840
or uh adam do you want to say something

739
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,840
or dave did you want to ask a question

740
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,919
oh wait oh you were trying to speak adam

741
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,879
nothing to add okay um

742
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,240
dave are you oh no okay you're out of

743
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,399
the queue

744
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
wow a little question little boxes

745
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,729
flying everywhere

746
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,900
um

747
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,900
[Music]

748
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,960
so uh bill do you have a sense

749
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,080
let me close some of these chat boxes

750
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,080
that are opening up on me

751
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,279
do we have a sense of next steps or how

752
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,559
much longer

753
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,480
and you might have just told me that

754
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,480
while i was trying to close chat boxes

755
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,519
um we definitely uh

756
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,120
that there's a fair amount of work still

757
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,000
to be done um

758
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,518
again kind of addressing uh all of

759
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,159
roman's comments would be the first

760
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,519
thing

761
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,200
um and then um a lot of the

762
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
the different information elements that

763
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,919
would uh go in

764
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,320
in each operation in section five uh

765
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,840
maybe that's part of the comments um

766
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,279
but yeah there's there's

767
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,519
there's a fair amount of work still to

768
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,519
go

769
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,320
okay uh any questions or comments

770
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,840
on the architecture document hey bill i

771
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,799
mean i have some nits in the current

772
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,320
document

773
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,600
but i'm loath to kind of put that out

774
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,439
there until you've kind of

775
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,120
tackled maybe some of roman stuff

776
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,679
but i don't really have i mean roman's

777
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,559
got i would say more

778
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,200
structural type comments and i think

779
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,440
those are

780
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,039
more valuable i have one structural

781
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,640
comment

782
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,320
um how do you want me to deal with them

783
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,080
uh you can you can send them to us on

784
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,279
the list that's fine we'll take them

785
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,720
okay i'm probably going to hold off on

786
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,480
the nits and just talk about

787
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,640
uh my one kind of structural comment

788
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,760
okay uh if you just want to email me the

789
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,320
nips then you can do that too

790
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,559
i mean they're they're few and minor so

791
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,720
i'll email them to you

792
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,720
go

793
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,240
okay any other questions or comments on

794
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
the architecture document

795
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,080
okay um

796
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:10,640
[Music]

all right so we're on slide two for you

837
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:35,200
okay thank you um this document

838
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:39,119
uh suggested a light weighted

839
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,319
vulnerability record because in the

840
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,839
work of continuously secure security

841
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
monitoring

842
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,000
if the same vulnerability of the same

843
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,920
host

844
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,839
is not fixed in time multiple records

845
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,280
will be generated

846
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,920
and the more frequent the detection

847
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,680
holds the more vulnerability records

848
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,920
will be generated

849
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,839
uh repeated vulnerability records will

850
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,280
waste the storage space and increase the

851
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,480
cost of data analysis so this

852
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,640
documentary proposes this light weighted

853
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,640
vulnerability recording methods

854
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:30,319
we defined several

855
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,919
we define several

856
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,520
things to carry the information

857
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,839
uh including ip address

858
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,800
port service protocol vulnerability name

859
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,400
vulnerability status vulnerability

860
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,680
detected time

861
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,480
and update time fixed time and the

862
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,759
vulnerability detail

863
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,920
okay the most important thing

864
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,359
in this document is

865
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,240
three times or about

866
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,240
vulnerability

867
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,160
the vulnerability detected time is the

868
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,680
time stamp that detects the

869
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,960
vulnerability first

870
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:25,680
time so is the it

871
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,680
record the first time uh when we

872
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
let me detect it that this is a

873
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,079
variability okay can i interrupt for

874
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,160
just a moment please

875
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,240
um okay the the meat echo uh

876
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,078
support people are suggesting are you in

877
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,959
presentation view

878
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,960
the it's the first if you look at all

879
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,440
those squares across the top it's the

880
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,280
first

881
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,839
um it's the first one

882
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,839
on the left

883
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,118
the first one on the left

884
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,800
is nice and um

885
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,799
the

886
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,598
set page it

887
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
um

888
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,839
the same page and

889
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:28,319
the middle the middle

890
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,320
okay here we us record

891
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,960
uh so over on the if you go um

892
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,400
and uh maybe i should just continue if

893
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,640
you go to the

894
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,359
if you go out you see where it says ietf

895
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,440
109 and sackum

896
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,279
and then goes straight across you see

897
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,560
that first square that has like a little

898
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,560
head and then a box

899
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,079
i i just i'm not sure what slide you're

900
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,280
on and i

901
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:02,000
i think you've moved on

902
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,359
okay uh the

903
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,400
third one the third page the third page

904
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:11,040
okay that's that

905
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,480
okay so you're on the third slide

906
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,359
yes okay sorry i i apologize for

907
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,880
interrupting you

908
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,880
i think we're on the same place now

909
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,720
so continue

910
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
okay

911
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,640
and then the

912
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,839
[Music]

913
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,839
vulnerability fixed time

914
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:49,599
it is the uh once it is detected

915
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:54,160
that the vulnerability has been fixed uh

916
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,280
we will record at this time and

917
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,640
once the vulnerability has been detected

918
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,839
and fixed

919
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,200
uh we will

920
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,400
set vulnerability status from

921
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,640
from one to zero uh

922
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,720
since one is vulnerability

923
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,040
exists and the zero is is vulnerability

924
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,040
fixed

925
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,720
and there is another time

926
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,720
um vulnerability update time

927
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,839
it is the last updated time of this

928
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,960
vulnerability

929
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:43,359
status um

930
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:47,440
it represents the latest update time

931
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,560
when detect uh many times

932
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,760
the last the latest time test stamp

933
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,240
will be recorded to cover the order

934
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,240
record

935
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,680
and suppose that a company carried out

936
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,640
a round of vulnerability detection every

937
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,919
day

938
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,160
and found that there is a

939
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,520
telnet weak password on a host

940
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,560
from one day to another

941
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,079
and it was fixed on

942
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,078
some sunday

943
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,599
fun vulnerability record generated

944
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,119
every day the record

945
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,319
uh you like

946
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,839
the slides

947
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,839
uh in the left

948
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:55,200
i posted um a picture

949
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,200
in slide in slide three and uh

950
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:03,839
in the left

951
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,319
it is a non-lightweighted durability

952
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,319
record

953
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,839
it will generated one record

954
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,839
one day and uh

955
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,799
when we scan vulnerability every day

956
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,800
uh it will

957
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,480
have a lot of records about

958
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,359
the same vulnerability and that's the

959
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,560
left

960
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:45,839
and if we use light weighted

961
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,839
vulnerability record

962
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:53,359
uh the record will will

963
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,359
there be only one record

964
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,839
in the database

965
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,520
and once this vulnerability

966
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,520
fixed

967
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,200
the record will change the vulnerability

968
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,240
status

969
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,240
from 1 to 0 and

970
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,160
vulnerability fixed time a vulnerability

971
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,640
fixed time will be

972
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,640
attached

973
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,280
i'll slide slide next slide please

974
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,200
we give an example some example records

975
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,800
are given

976
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,799
this in this slide

977
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,160
we had a tool to do

978
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:58,000
vulnerabilities again and

979
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:01,200
record whether the vulnerability exists

980
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,200
or fixed

981
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:09,839
here is some example

982
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,480
for for each vulnerability

983
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:20,078
only one record will keep

984
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,280
and uh is much more

985
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:28,400
easier to analyze this

986
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:37,599
vulnerability data yes that's

987
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:42,560
that's all for this document

988
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,560
okay uh does anybody have any questions

989
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,720
uh go ahead

990
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,760
hi lee john thanks for your presentation

991
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,560
uh this is what come from huawei i have

992
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,040
a question

993
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,839
about your draft i have read your draft

994
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,119
and

995
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,680
i'm curious about the noun light

996
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,240
weighted

997
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,160
vulnerability record you mentioned is

998
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,799
there any existing

999
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:14,720
standard about the the

1000
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,720
non-lightweighted vulnerability record

1001
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:24,799
many vulnerability scan tools

1002
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,799
we use the uh

1003
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:35,440
they use their use non-literated

1004
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,440
vulnerability record lesson

1005
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,480
yeah i know i i mean uh is there any

1006
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,280
existing standard

1007
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,880
uh about the non-lightweighted

1008
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,599
vulnerability record

1009
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,160
because you want to have some changes to

1010
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,200
the

1011
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,399
uh non-light weighted so i

1012
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,598
i'm curious is there any existing

1013
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,720
standard of the

1014
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:04,160
non-light weighted oh

1015
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,919
sorry i don't know whether it had

1016
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:13,279
been become a standard

1017
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,839
from a country or international

1018
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,839
international

1019
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:24,480
uh it seems no

1020
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,200
international stand standard for for

1021
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,119
this kind

1022
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:32,078
of record

1023
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,319
okay so i'm not correct i'm not pretty

1024
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
sure

1025
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,439
you release the song

1026
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,880
vulnerability scan tools you use

1027
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,400
uh so many storage

1028
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:53,520
or so many data to

1029
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,520
record some

1030
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:02,078
sound information

1031
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,079
repeated so i

1032
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:14,319
propose this document

1033
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,520
yes i um the reason i asked

1034
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:21,200
the question is because uh you

1035
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,759
in the draft you uh first mentioned the

1036
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,680
non-lightweighted record and then you

1037
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,720
mentioned how to improve the

1038
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,520
non-lightweighted array code so

1039
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,118
if there is no existing record about the

1040
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,800
non-line widget

1041
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,839
i think you just need to write up

1042
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,880
write a full document uh introduce all

1043
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:44,000
the

1044
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,119
elements in the records you mentioned in

1045
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:52,319
the

1046
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:56,240
lightweight vulnerability record

1047
00:47:52,319 --> 00:48:07,599
thank you for your suggestion

1048
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:10,879
reasonable yeah

1049
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,160
also i have another question um

1050
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,520
i kind of feel like they uh this is

1051
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:20,799
an intern internal implementation

1052
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,839
issue uh yes i don't

1053
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,720
i don't think it's an interoperability

1054
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,599
issue so i don't think it is uh

1055
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,680
appropriate

1056
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,680
to standardize this work

1057
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,079
operator you mean i mean

1058
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,880
uh uh about the

1059
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,440
interaction between devices between

1060
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,170
network

1061
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,040
devices

1062
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:50,559
[Music]

1063
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,119
because it's internal implementation

1064
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,119
so you don't need to standardize it

1065
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,240
better we can have

1066
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:11,920
standard for the way

1067
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,919
how to record sound vulnerability

1068
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:20,160
information

1069
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,680
yeah but i don't know whether this is

1070
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:31,839
appropriate to standardize

1071
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:31,839
in itf

1072
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,359
uh this is dave holtzmeier is the

1073
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,040
is the intent for developing this

1074
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:47,119
lightweight vulnerability reporting

1075
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,640
format so that

1076
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,400
tools that generate vulnerability

1077
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,598
reports would be able to share that

1078
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,280
information

1079
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,760
with tools that would consume those

1080
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,760
vulnerability reports

1081
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,680
and if that's the if that's the use case

1082
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,720
then you know there could be value in

1083
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,720
standardizing this

1084
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:16,000
come on

1085
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,079
um but but then i think

1086
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,760
if that is true the larger question is

1087
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:23,119
the second the right

1088
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,119
the right place to do that work

1089
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:30,240
um you said that is the

1090
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,240
right place to do this work

1091
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,839
yes um because i'm not certain that this

1092
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,520
is something that we've been

1093
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,279
chartered to do um

1094
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,759
is there a reason why you submitted this

1095
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,520
draft to saccum why you thought

1096
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,440
sakham was the right place to do this

1097
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:54,079
work

1098
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:57,680
uh i think the the security error

1099
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:01,839
is the best error to do this work

1100
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:09,839
and this working group is the

1101
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:09,839
best group to do this work

1102
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,319
um okay ramen did you

1103
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:26,079
no it's not about this document

1104
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,359
is not about vulnerability

1105
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:33,359
information exchange

1106
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:37,200
or vulnerability information

1107
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:41,759
is about vulnerability information

1108
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:45,480
collection or vulnerability scanning

1109
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,040
as in security at the as a security

1110
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,319
administrator

1111
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,359
we always needed to do

1112
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,759
sound security sound vulnerabilities

1113
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,759
again

1114
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,960
ted ramen hi

1115
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,118
uh li jang thanks for your bringing your

1116
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,240
your draft to the working group

1117
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:17,119
uh i had a similar question i think uh

1118
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,000
to what was asked by the two previous uh

1119
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,280
speakers

1120
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,319
which is i i didn't fully understand how

1121
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,839
broad of a set of information elements

1122
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,520
you wanted to include

1123
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,400
is it as simple as you're roughly

1124
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,000
describing in this example or do you

1125
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,200
envision a much richer

1126
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,359
vocabulary in my head

1127
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,960
back to what we pan was talking about

1128
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,040
things like oval

1129
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:45,040
and iodef sci have

1130
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,960
have have some of these information kind

1131
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,839
of elements so i'm trying to understand

1132
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,480
how

1133
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,520
how what's talked about here overlaps uh

1134
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,200
overlaps kind of

1135
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,040
with the discussion here if you have a

1136
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,879
sense for that

1137
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:03,119
oh we only

1138
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:06,720
do this work uh to

1139
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,559
to the um hosts

1140
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,558
or servers that are uh

1141
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,599
in in this company or

1142
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,599
in a

1143
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:29,839
specific era not do this

1144
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:29,839
on the internet

1145
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:46,400
so actually the

1146
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,598
most important thing of this document

1147
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:53,200
is not about vulnerability

1148
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,559
information collection or some

1149
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:00,399
other internet information

1150
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,520
connection uh is a is a way

1151
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,079
to record vulnerability and

1152
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,079
then to

1153
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:25,839
improve the security level

1154
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:25,839
of a company's network

1155
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:35,040
okay um so

1156
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,400
i i think at this stage um

1157
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:41,119
there have been there's been some good

1158
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,119
questions asked we probably ought to

1159
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,598
take further discussion to the mailing

1160
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:49,598
list i think

1161
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,599
i'm hearing that there's questions about

1162
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,200
whether this is actually within the

1163
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,000
sakham scope or not

1164
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,839
so i think discussion providing the

1165
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,599
author some guidance about where

1166
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:02,319
it might belong if it doesn't belong

1167
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,839
here and then also any technical

1168
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,839
questions on the draft itself

1169
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:07,839
um

1170
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:21,839
does anybody is there any additional

1171
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:21,839
feedback on this document

1172
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,720
okay um

1173
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,240
so the the slides for the last

1174
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,960
presentation

1175
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,680
um are not up in materials but i'll get

1176
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,119
them loaded

1177
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,118
um i got them

1178
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,480
a bit late so they're not listed up

1179
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,400
there

1180
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:50,799
um so the next

1181
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,799
um

1182
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,920
thing is a discussion of way ahead what

1183
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,920
we think our next steps are

1184
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,920
um the

1185
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,040
we we have coastwood which we think is

1186
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,680
going to be

1187
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,440
four to six weeks to resolve all of the

1188
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:11,680
ad comments

1189
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,599
uh we have the roley configuration

1190
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,319
checklist which is meeting bi-weekly and

1191
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,799
will get us

1192
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:21,599
a working group draft published

1193
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:23,119
sometime soon we have sacrum

1194
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,359
architecture which still has a fair

1195
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,160
amount of work

1196
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:31,839
but is making progress and and then we

1197
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,839
have the new submission

1198
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:39,280
i think it probably makes sense to do

1199
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,279
a

1200
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,960
you know for better for worse we seem to

1201
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,599
make more progress

1202
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,359
and meet deadlines when we have meetings

1203
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,720
um

1204
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:52,720
so i'm thinking um

1205
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:56,839
somewhere from the middle of january to

1206
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,520
the middle of february we should

1207
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,040
probably have a virtual interim

1208
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,559
maybe middle of january middle of

1209
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,558
february is too close to march

1210
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,399
any comments on that questions

1211
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,280
uh go ahead adam can you hear me this

1212
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,799
time

1213
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,559
i can yes hey how about that all right

1214
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,759
um yeah i think that's probably a good

1215
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,520
idea um

1216
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,960
yeah we just need to get it scheduled

1217
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,200
and like specifically for the

1218
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,880
architecture draft and bill sorry if i

1219
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:39,919
am overstepping in some way um

1220
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,000
you know i know i provided feedback i

1221
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:43,839
know roman provided feedback

1222
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,640
i'd like others to provide feedback as

1223
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:46,640
well if we can

1224
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:54,160
and then then i think we're willing to

1225
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:56,799
keep moving forward with the draft right

1226
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,359
i think we are as long as it's making

1227
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:59,520
progress

1228
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:01,279
i think the the conversation we had had

1229
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:03,520
prior was that um

1230
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,839
it wasn't it didn't look like it was

1231
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,680
getting to a consensus

1232
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:12,078
um but it seems to be moving in the

1233
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,279
right direction now

1234
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,960
it would be very helpful to have

1235
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,960
additional comments on it though i think

1236
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,598
just to be clear what we're effectively

1237
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,880
saying

1238
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:34,640
is that on deck we have the

1239
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,240
we have the coast with document that's

1240
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,680
almost wrapped up we're going to

1241
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,759
continue progressing

1242
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,598
and buttoning up the really config

1243
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,359
checklist and the architecture document

1244
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,839
and the open question is is there

1245
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:50,880
anything more for us to do after that

1246
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:53,200
correct that's correct okay

1247
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,200
um

1248
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:02,000
okay um so we'll

1249
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,598
um chris and i'll send out a doodle poll

1250
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,960
for some time

1251
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:06,960
middle to end of january

1252
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,599
i don't i don't think there's any point

1253
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,119
in trying to have something in december

1254
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,160
because by the time we give three or

1255
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:17,760
four weeks we're into

1256
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,440
getting close to the holidays so but

1257
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,880
that is going to be two months is that

1258
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,440
too long or we think we're going to be

1259
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,440
good with that

1260
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,520
okay um

1261
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,680
and with that that brings us to the last

1262
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,440
agenda item is there any other business

1263
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,960
anybody would like to discuss

1264
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,960
oh i see a chat message

1265
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:48,720
yeah right i don't think it's realistic

1266
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,040
for december

1267
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,040
um

1268
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,240
all right um

1269
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,720
i guess our our note to self is we

1270
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:03,359
probably should have requested an hour

1271
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,640
instead of two hours

1272
01:00:03,359 --> 01:00:09,920
um with that uh

1273
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:13,359
i believe we are done

1274
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,760
mini nap time for our 80 yeah nap time

1275
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:18,720
