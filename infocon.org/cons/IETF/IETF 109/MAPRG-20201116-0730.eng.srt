1
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

2
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,679
okay um good morning everybody

3
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,760
this is uh the map rg session

4
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,120
um i had a little problem sharing

5
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,480
with my other brothers so i'm now in

6
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
safari instead of sharing my whole

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
screen

8
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,080
which means i cannot really see um

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,880
the controls however i will quickly

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,240
run through my sets of the slides and

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
then um

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,920
if possible i would like to ask the

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,960
first presenter emily

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,080
to maybe share the slides on your own or

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,919
at least try that

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,759
and then i can try to fix that where i

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,119
will listen to that presentation so that

18
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,720
would be good

19
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,439
um welcome to itf 109

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,960
we are online again uh nevertheless we

21
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,960
have some nice presentations today

22
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,000
um this is the note well part about the

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,199
intellectual property rights um similar

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
as the ietf the irtf has adopted rules

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,079
about

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,600
participation in intellectual property

27
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,079
rights um

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,240
and you should study those rcs which are

29
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
um linked here on the slide if you

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
haven't seen this before

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
in order to know what you get yourself

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,159
and when you're participating here on

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
the mic or in any way

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,520
in the java or anyway um we also

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,038
have in the itf a couple of policies

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,599
about privacy and code of

37
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,119
conduct so if you want to participate

38
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
here and you're not aware of these

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
rscs please also have a look at them and

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,799
then the next slide

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,879
is quickly um giving you a reminder or

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
some understanding that the irtf is

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,599
actually not the same as the ietf

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,519
what the difference are and how to how

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,319
to how these two organizations work

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
together

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,440
or interwove and there's another rc you

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
can study if you want to

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,359
and this is the usual slide which is

50
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,920
more useful if you actually go to the

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,599
material so you can click on these links

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,359
find all the links you need we find our

53
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,959
charter so what is this group about you

54
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,239
find the slides you find the meet echo

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,720
link which you probably have

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
found already hopefully and there's also

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,640
the java room

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,120
and um this is our agenda today

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,119
so um we have this very quick overview

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,040
here because we have a packed agenda

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
uh we only requested one hour slot

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,519
because it's an online meeting

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,399
uh and some people are not the perfect

64
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,760
time zone

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,840
so we try to keep this a little bit

66
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,040
short but actually kind of fortunately

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,239
unfortunately however you want to take

68
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,879
it we got like

69
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,120
a lot of nice contributions and so what

70
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,679
we have today is that we have two longer

71
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
talks

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
um uh the the first point about network

73
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,120
fingerprinting and the second one about

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,959
uh oblivious um dough measurements which

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,799
are kind of brand new material

76
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,640
and then we have like the later threes

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,920
are only five-minute head-up heads-up

78
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,399
talks

79
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,720
because these have been a really really

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,640
good piece of work all three of them

81
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,480
but these have been published in papers

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,040
in the imc conference

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,879
and they have been presentations about

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
that and also the long videos about

85
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,679
these presentations

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,518
are available online so if you want to

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,560
know more you can watch them

88
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
or maybe you have watched them in

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,159
advance already because you're prepared

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,000
um and and you can read the papers all

91
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,760
the links for the papers and the videos

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
are in the agenda so if you look up in

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,159
the data tracker click on the agenda

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
you get more information there and with

95
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,000
that

96
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,920
i will try to stop stop sharing here

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,959
and see if emilyne is available to maybe

98
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,959
share his self

99
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,638
english should i share my screen if you

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,199
can that would be great for me

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,800
okay so i'm clicking uh

102
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
where should i it's the first time i'm

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
using this tool so i don't yeah

104
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,840
so um yeah next to the video and audio

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,080
button there's also the screen

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,198
sharing symbol basically so if you can

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,039
click that one

108
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:49,520
and i can grant you that let's see

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:53,440
okay yes that's me

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,000
and these are my slides okay perfect

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,919
thank you um well uh hello everyone

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
and uh thank you for listening to this

113
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,120
presentation on network

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,479
fingerprinting and routers under attack

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,080
so first i will introduce what motivated

116
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,960
this work with auto research questions

117
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
then i will talk about fingerprinting

118
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
what it is

119
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,240
and how it works and after that i will

120
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,120
review our methodology for the

121
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,320
experiments

122
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,960
that we did and finally i will comment

123
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,800
on some

124
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,680
key results that we found

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,120
okay so for our first research question

126
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
here we are interested

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
in knowing what is the hardware

128
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
ecosystem

129
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,840
within the internet and within operators

130
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
so here actually we want to discover

131
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,520
where the different

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,479
brands of hardware that is to say

133
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,758
juniper

134
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,960
cisco alcatel etc where those different

135
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
brands of hardware

136
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,840
are located inside the network and what

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
is the role that they play

138
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,840
and knowing this is actually important

139
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,120
for a second research

140
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,080
question which is what could happen

141
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,520
if an attacker is able to identify the

142
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,520
brand of a router

143
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,318
and use that information to launch a

144
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,880
targeted attack on sale routers

145
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,960
so from the output that we get from

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,479
question one we can get a view

147
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,880
of what could happen in such a scenario

148
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
and these questions are motivated by the

149
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,319
fact that

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
recently there are five vulnerabilities

151
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
that have been found

152
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,560
in cisco devices vulnerabilities that

153
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,919
can lead to a remote code

154
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,600
execution and denial of service attacks

155
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,880
but there's not only cisco there are

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,000
also several other manufacturers

157
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,080
for which a vulnerability in the rsm

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,880
implementation has been found

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,240
uh first a bit of a background how can

160
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,719
we actually tell

161
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,560
the brand of a router well this is

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,120
called fingerprinting

163
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,080
and the basic idea is to send some

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,919
probes to

165
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,560
a device and analyze its responses

166
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,400
so recently there was a very lightweight

167
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,840
fingerprinting technique that was

168
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,400
proposed

169
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
and that relies only on two different

170
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
probes

171
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,400
to be able to get the hardware of the

172
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,599
router and sometimes even the operating

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
system

174
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,280
and so this technique is based on a

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
specific field in the ip packet

176
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,000
which is the time to leave field so

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,400
routers when they send a packet they

178
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
put an initial value in this field which

179
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,000
is almost

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,560
always 30 32 64

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,880
128 or 255

182
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,440
and so the people who have found this

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,639
technique have also shown that

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,000
it is enough to get these two values

185
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,680
for a time exceeded packet and an echo

186
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
reply packet

187
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,000
so these two values we call that the

188
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,440
router signature this is what tells

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,960
us what is the brand of the router and

190
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,280
in this table you can find the different

191
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,280
classes of hardware that we are able to

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,000
identify with this technique

193
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,799
we can differentiate between cisco

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,440
juniper

195
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
juniper with the operating system junos

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,280
e

197
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,400
and the last class which is composed of

198
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:27,198
brocade alcatel and linux machines

199
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,719
and that we will call the bell class

200
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:34,640
okay so on to the data we collected

201
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,039
we use tnt which is a paris choice root

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,718
extension that comes with this

203
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,399
lightweight fingerprinting technique

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,599
that we just talked about

205
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,560
and additionally it can also reveal mpls

206
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,399
tunnels

207
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,959
so it has the potential to discover more

208
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
ip

209
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,399
addresses than the classic traceroute

210
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
does

211
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,680
and we launched tnt between the 1st of

212
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,560
november to the 13th of november of last

213
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,920
year

214
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,160
over 28 vantage points and overall we

215
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,719
collected 1.2 million

216
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,719
addresses

217
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,880
so from these traces we then used

218
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
another tool

219
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,880
midar to perform alias resolution which

220
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
is the process

221
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,080
of identifying which ip addresses belong

222
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,040
to the same router

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
and so from the ip level topology that

224
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
we got

225
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,359
with tnt we can get a router level

226
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,600
topology

227
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
with middle and this is actually

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
interesting for us

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,240
because these topologies they are closer

230
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,719
to reality they are more concrete

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
and so we can better study network

232
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,839
resiliency

233
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,719
and robustness on this kind of topology

234
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,040
so with our tool middle we were able to

235
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,720
identify

236
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,959
65 000 routers having all together

237
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,600
200 000 addresses

238
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,680
and finally the last bit of processing

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,720
that we did on the data was to use

240
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,120
the tool border mappit which allows us

241
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,760
to determine who is the owner of

242
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,120
a router in the sense what is the

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,480
autonomous system

244
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
that operates this router and our goal

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,839
here

246
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,720
is to delimit as precisely as possible

247
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,000
the different

248
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:27,040
ass in the network to study

249
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,040
hardware ecosystem at a finer scale

250
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,000
okay so back to our first research

251
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
question what did we find

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
what did we find well let's first look

253
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
at

254
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,720
the internet as a whole on your left

255
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
here you have

256
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
a graph that gives the signature

257
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,200
reportation for both

258
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,360
addresses and routers and what we can

259
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
get from this graph basically

260
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,600
is that cisco largely dominates the

261
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,319
overall market

262
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
so we can see for example that nearly 60

263
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,079
percent

264
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,360
of the routing devices are actually

265
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,160
cisco devices

266
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,560
now if we look at a finer scale at the

267
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,279
scale of the autonomous system

268
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,800
well this graph gives us once again the

269
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,760
hardware repartition

270
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
but for four large asses this time for

271
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,000
asa

272
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
b c and d and what we can already see

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
from this graph

274
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,360
is that the hardware repartition can be

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,839
very different from one as to the other

276
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,040
for example with asa we see a lot of

277
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,320
cisco devices

278
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,199
but for asd it's not the case at all we

279
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,880
see

280
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,480
only almost junos for asb we see also a

281
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,600
lot of junas

282
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,040
and for asc we have a nearly equal mix

283
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,200
of bell and genus routers so yes what we

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,439
can conclude here is that

285
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,360
different ascs have very different

286
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,000
hardware ecosystems

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,839
and it can also be very different from

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,839
the global point of view

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,959
okay now on to the second research

290
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,839
question

291
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,199
now that we know more about the ases

292
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,680
infrastructure

293
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,000
what could happen if an attacker is able

294
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,479
to easily identify the brand of

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,040
a router and then use that information

296
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,360
to launch a targeted attack

297
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
well the first thing to know here is

298
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,920
that not all routers

299
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
contribute equally to forwarding packets

300
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,760
in the network

301
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,120
okay we have small routers we have big

302
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:32,240
routers with a lot of forwarding power

303
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,399
and so if it turns out that a certain

304
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,079
brand of router is important for

305
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,920
forwarding the traffic

306
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,359
and if that brand of router has a

307
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,680
vulnerability

308
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,760
then it could be a target of interest

309
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:47,199
for attackers

310
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,000
to to target those routers

311
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,079
so how are we going to measure the

312
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
impact of an attack on a brand of

313
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,680
routers

314
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,079
well we already saw the hardware

315
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,120
distribution that i've put back here

316
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,399
um so for example if we look at asa we

317
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,279
could say okay

318
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,240
we see a lot of cisco routers so we can

319
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
conclude

320
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
that cisco routers are important for

321
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
forwarding the traffic

322
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,160
but actually the the amount of routers

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
does not necessarily reflect the amount

324
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,839
of traffic

325
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,719
that is being carried so this is a first

326
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,600
indicator yes but we need another metric

327
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,839
to measure that and this metric is the

328
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,560
hardware popularity

329
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,399
we we compute the hardware popularity as

330
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,079
the proportion of traces

331
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,160
that cross each brand of hardware and

332
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,880
this metric it has been shown that it

333
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,480
reflects the amount of the actual amount

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
of traffic

335
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,160
so what do we get when we compute it

336
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,160
well here it is

337
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,399
we see that actually it's quite close to

338
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,880
the hardware distribution

339
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,760
so our first indicator was already a

340
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
good one

341
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,120
but still we can see some differences

342
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,680
for example for asc

343
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,040
in terms of number of routers we saw a

344
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,399
nearly equal mix

345
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,560
between belle and junas but when we look

346
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
at the amount of traffic that is being

347
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,119
carried we see that actually bal

348
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,880
is more important for forwarding the

349
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,839
traffic

350
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,360
okay so how did we proceed with our

351
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,760
experiment

352
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,519
well for each brand of router we

353
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,199
simulated an attack

354
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,839
by taking down different fractions of

355
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,120
the different brands of routers and we

356
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,000
looked at the impact

357
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,959
in terms of traces impacted in the

358
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,120
network

359
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,439
and we performed the simulation 30 times

360
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,399
and averaged the results that you can

361
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,839
see here

362
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,560
on your right so we have one graph per

363
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,959
as

364
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,760
let's look for it for example at asa

365
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,399
we can see here that it is enough to

366
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,680
take down

367
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,600
20 of the cisco routers

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,880
to impact already nearly 60

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,680
of the traces of all the traces

370
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,880
in this network so it's quite an impact

371
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,439
already

372
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,639
and on the other hand we see that

373
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,199
attacks on

374
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,720
junos and on buy routers they don't have

375
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,680
much of an impact

376
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,199
compared to compared to attacks on cisco

377
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,160
so yes this autonomous system asa

378
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,199
is quite vulnerable to attacks on cisco

379
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,519
for asb

380
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,519
however this is not the case at all here

381
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,279
we see that

382
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,279
attacks on genus are actually more

383
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,040
harmful to the network than

384
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:42,079
attacks on cisco so as expected

385
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,800
given the hardware popularity we can see

386
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,638
that

387
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,240
not all asses will react in the same way

388
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,440
to different attacks okay

389
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,000
so time to wrap things up what can we

390
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
conclude

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,759
from this presentation well the first

392
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,399
thing is that

393
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,199
someone can very easily retrieve the

394
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
brand of

395
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,000
a router by sending only two probes to

396
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,880
this router

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,800
the second thing is that um the

398
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,439
different as they can have very

399
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,680
different

400
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,279
uh hardware reportation and hardware

401
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,319
popularity

402
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,959
and third because of this uh different

403
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,079
asses will be more or less vulnerable to

404
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,959
different types

405
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,839
of attacks depending depending on the

406
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,800
hardware infrastructure

407
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
and that's it for me i hope you enjoyed

408
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,920
the talk

409
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,800
thank you thank you very much uh for

410
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,079
this nice talk

411
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,599
um and also as you went um

412
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,519
through in time we actually have some

413
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,880
time for questions

414
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,240
so if people would like to join the

415
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,839
queue

416
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
you have an opportunity right now

417
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
yep there's brian

418
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
please animate yourself

419
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,799
okay so they've changed this slightly

420
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,438
since the last time hi uh

421
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,480
so uh a quick question on on the

422
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,000
takeaways here

423
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,120
would a uh another way to phrase this

424
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,319
be um there are definite advantages to

425
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,159
being a multi-vendor

426
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,319
um uh as in terms of

427
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
your ability to like so this basically

428
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,639
is looking at the amount of traffic

429
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
that's going through these these

430
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,880
architectures could this tool be

431
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,000
used to to quantify for a

432
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,880
given as what their return is

433
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
on having you know uh routers from

434
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,919
multiple vendors right like so

435
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,520
you could use this to map yourself as

436
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,200
opposed to what you've done is to map it

437
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
from externally

438
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,039
yes it's um it's actually um well in the

439
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,240
paper we

440
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,200
have a few suggestions for our network

441
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
operators

442
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
and one of the suggestions we didn't put

443
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,919
but i think

444
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,600
about later was that maybe there could

445
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
be an advantage for

446
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,639
autonomous system to have several uh

447
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,520
vendors several manufacturers

448
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,480
in order to to not be that vulnerable to

449
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,679
not rely on

450
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
only one single brand but maybe a

451
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,440
drawback

452
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,200
of this would be in terms of management

453
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,400
overhead maybe it's complicated to um

454
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,160
to deal with that many routers because

455
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,679
they're cool but there's like actual

456
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,400
data on the vulnerability side of that

457
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,880
from this paper so that's cool thanks

458
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
you're welcome thank you and that also

459
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,919
reminded me that

460
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,120
brian nicely volunteered to take note so

461
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,000
thank you for that

462
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,000
any other questions

463
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,799
okay then thank you again and we move on

464
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,360
to the next talk and we have sadish

465
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,879
online here and he will also try to

466
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:11,840
share

467
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:11,840
i should be able to grant that

468
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,000
and it's coming nice okay i'm

469
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,719
am i audible yes you are you can start

470
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
thank you

471
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,559
okay yeah uh thank you so much

472
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
so um hello everyone thank you for being

473
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,559
here today

474
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,639
i am sudeesh and i'll be presenting uh

475
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,000
the measurements of a privacy enhancing

476
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,000
dns protocol

477
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,559
called odo or oblivious dns over https

478
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,480
and uh this work is uh the result of a

479
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
collaborative effort between lots of

480
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,559
incredible people at cloudflare

481
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
and was a part of my internship uh this

482
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,639
summer uh with them

483
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,400
and uh this talk will focus on uh the

484
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,360
odo standard proposal that was

485
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
co-authored by

486
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,479
apple and cloudflare and we're committed

487
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,039
to actually moving this forward

488
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,320
as a quick introduction dns is the

489
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,480
domain name system and

490
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,600
is the foundation for the human usable

491
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000
internet

492
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
it responds to client queries for host

493
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
names with the corresponding

494
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,799
ip addresses and records and

495
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,520
traditionally

496
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,840
the dns protocol is not encrypted and it

497
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,639
uses udp which continues to be

498
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,360
a majority of the traffic received by

499
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,200
the public

500
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,559
recursive resolver which cloudflare

501
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,919
operates and

502
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,280
the usage of non-encrypted dns leaks

503
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,159
user information to

504
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,840
network operators to on-path adversaries

505
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,919
who are observing the network

506
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,600
and even allows active attackers to

507
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,440
modify the network request

508
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
from the client or the response from the

509
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,400
server

510
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
but to overcome some of these problems

511
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
there have been

512
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,439
recent efforts to secure dns using dns

513
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,360
over tls

514
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,280
dot or dns over https with doh

515
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
and uh these have been gaining

516
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,280
popularity and have been

517
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,120
integrated into various web browsers

518
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,600
operating systems uh protecting the

519
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,239
client

520
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,158
traffic from being observed by onlookers

521
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,360
or being intercepted and changed by the

522
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,760
attackers

523
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,158
but however the resolver operator can

524
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,400
continue to associate the client request

525
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,280
to the ip address and build a profile

526
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,600
around their browsing patterns

527
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,120
but over the past few years we've seen

528
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,039
active measurement research

529
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,158
trying to understand and measure the

530
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,200
impacts of uh

531
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,280
encrypted protocols like doe or dod

532
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
and many large scale measurements have

533
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,799
shown that the performance of these

534
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,520
encrypted protocols

535
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,520
vary by the choice of the resolver and

536
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,559
it does not significantly impact page

537
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,960
load times

538
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,879
and it improves user security so there

539
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,039
have also been various attempts to

540
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:48,159
uh improve page loads using prefetching

541
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,919
but while dot did improve the security

542
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,320
of dns queries for clients

543
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,159
it also received a lot of criticism uh

544
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,480
of the because of the small number of

545
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
publicly available resolver services

546
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
essentially centralizing the internet

547
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,400
and giving these

548
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,840
organizations a lot of control but

549
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,640
additionally

550
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,480
these resolver operators also uh can can

551
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
associate client queries with the client

552
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,960
ip addresses and use the ips to geo

553
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,280
locate the client

554
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,520
to maintain privacy guarantees some

555
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
operators actively purge data exceeding

556
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,400
24 hours and give their users

557
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,320
privacy policy based guarantees and

558
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,320
bringing together a lot of organizations

559
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,120
to agree to a common set of privacy

560
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,439
practices

561
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,399
is extremely difficult and it requires

562
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,640
explicit negotiation and a lot of effort

563
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,600
mozilla for example actively defined

564
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,840
criteria

565
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,000
around data retention aggregation and

566
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,320
frequent audits for the door services

567
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,080
to be configured as a default to the

568
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,240
firefox browser

569
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,158
and while some users might might be

570
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,840
comfortable with this idea of having a

571
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,520
policy driven approach

572
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,760
these are difficult to enforce and

573
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,039
they're also very time consuming

574
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,440
making users want a system that that can

575
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,480
technologically guarantee their privacy

576
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
and uh in in this talk i'll focus on the

577
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,080
privacy critiques

578
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,679
and the ability for the resolvers to be

579
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,039
able to create a profile

580
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,600
for for their clients and

581
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,840
this is exactly where oblivious dns or

582
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
over https or odo kicks in

583
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,439
at a high level there are three main

584
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,760
components in odo the first are the

585
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,000
clients who prepare a query for which

586
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,960
they would like a response and the goals

587
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,280
of the clients

588
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,240
in odo is to be able to successfully

589
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,240
send

590
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
encrypted messages receive valid

591
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,320
responses to decrypt

592
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,679
and in the process be able to identify

593
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,360
if there are any malicious

594
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,240
actors and take any corrective actions

595
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,080
the second is a proxy instance whose

596
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,080
main role is to relay the encrypted

597
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,879
queries and responses to and from the

598
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,600
targets

599
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,240
while removing the client ip addresses

600
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,559
and

601
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,400
the third is a target instance which

602
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,639
receives the encrypted query

603
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
from the client decrypts it obtains the

604
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,799
dns response for the query

605
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,840
uh processes it to retrieve another to

606
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,760
get a response

607
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,678
encrypts the response and sends it back

608
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,840
to the proxy and it has no

609
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,799
ability to identify who the actual

610
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,918
client is by the ip address

611
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,200
but at a high level the design of odo is

612
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,840
similar to that of dough

613
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,240
and injects an intermediate proxy node

614
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,720
which terminates the client query

615
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,760
over here queue and performs the query

616
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,760
on the client's behalf

617
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,000
and the main goal of odo is is actually

618
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,400
to prevent

619
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,360
recursive resolvers and isps running

620
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
such as

621
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,918
running such resolvers from being able

622
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,399
to link the clients to their requests

623
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,400
so a client encrypts their query using a

624
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,120
hybrid public key encryption scheme

625
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,039
and using a validated public key from

626
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,439
the target resolver and sends this

627
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,120
query to a proxy instance and there are

628
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,600
various ways in which the clients can

629
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,520
actually

630
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,279
learn about these services and validate

631
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,760
them through dns sec

632
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,400
look for conflicting keys but however in

633
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,080
this talk

634
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,760
i'll i'll be pointing on this problem

635
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,799
but there are more details

636
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,679
that are available in the report but

637
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,600
in odo the uh the proxy instance can see

638
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,840
the ip address of the client but not the

639
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,000
contents of the dns query and forwards

640
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,918
this message to the oblivious target

641
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
which decrypts the query and obtains the

642
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,039
response from the resolver

643
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,360
and the response is encrypted by the

644
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,200
oblivious target and is sent back to the

645
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,879
resolver who sends this message

646
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,960
back to the client where it can be

647
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,600
decrypted and in this process

648
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,640
the target only sees the dns content and

649
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,520
not the actual client's ip address

650
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,919
but we often say the target resolver as

651
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,840
like

652
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,200
independent entities but this need not

653
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,279
really be true

654
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
ideally in practice for performance

655
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,000
reasons the the oblivious target and the

656
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,080
recursive resolver could be co-located

657
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,080
and this avoids the additional network

658
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,399
messages between the oblivious target

659
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,480
and the resolver but it is still

660
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,919
possible to maintain these as individual

661
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,600
services without any co-location

662
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
but now with the understanding of the

663
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,559
protocol in place we actually set out to

664
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,159
understand

665
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,320
and measure three main research

666
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,120
questions the first one was what is the

667
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,360
impact of odo on the dns response times

668
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,760
and how does this protocol affect page

669
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,600
load times and user experiences

670
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,440
also how does this compare itself to

671
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,959
other privacy enhancing protocol

672
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
techniques that are actually out there

673
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,679
today

674
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
and this helped us understand the cost

675
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,120
of privacy while maintaining the

676
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,199
security guarantees and the need for

677
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,279
performance

678
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,559
this slide uh pretty much sums up the

679
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,320
results of our measurement

680
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,600
and is probably the most interest to all

681
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,200
of you but

682
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,120
but i'll leave this here as a reference

683
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,799
to come back to just in case anyone

684
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,799
wants to refer to the slides

685
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,639
and in the next few slides actually talk

686
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,480
about the measurement that we perform

687
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,880
and detail each one of these takeaways

688
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,919
so let's get to the measurement we

689
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,159
implement and

690
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,600
deploy the oblivious targets and proxies

691
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,960
using a google cloud

692
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,199
and a serverless platform like

693
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,360
cloudflare workers and we physically

694
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,279
separate the oblivious target instances

695
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,840
from the resolvers and randomize the

696
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,360
query

697
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,439
from the targets to three public

698
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,240
resolvers to cloudflare dns

699
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,360
google dns and quad 9 which we use in

700
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,919
our measurements

701
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,840
we use nine google data center locations

702
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,960
seven across the united states one in

703
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,840
montreal canada

704
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,679
and one in sao paulo in brazil with 10

705
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
client instances running at each of

706
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,080
these vantage points performing the

707
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,840
experiment of sending dns requests

708
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,000
at a rate of 15 requests per minute

709
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,799
which is the average number of dns

710
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,640
queries

711
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,000
sent by client devices with high

712
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
internet usage

713
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
and the average bandwidth that we have

714
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
for all the clients running on a single

715
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,120
core

716
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,120
intel xeon is roughly 480 megabits per

717
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,760
second

718
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,678
but the clients perform dns response

719
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,240
time measurements by choosing pairs of

720
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,720
available proxies and targets

721
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,559
and by choosing a low latency proxy

722
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,440
target pair for the measurement

723
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,000
uh shown in the orange line here we find

724
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,200
that the average query response time

725
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,600
improves by 22.8 percent compared to

726
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,440
only choosing a low latency proxy as

727
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,840
shown in the green line

728
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,919
and this hints towards the fact that

729
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,678
having an intermediate proxy on the same

730
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,039
network path to the target

731
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,000
will improve the response time

732
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,360
performance and this path however can be

733
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,919
quite different from the path that a

734
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,918
udp-based dns packet might actually

735
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,039
travel on

736
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,360
but what about connection reuse

737
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,279
and connection reuse is an optimization

738
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,559
that can enable clients to improve their

739
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,440
performance by at least

740
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,000
46 percent on an average and it avoids

741
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,320
unnecessary tcp and tls handshakes for

742
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,399
each request

743
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,320
in our experimental setup we uh we

744
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,639
evaluate for the worst case performance

745
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,240
and incur an additional network latency

746
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,960
between the target instance and the

747
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
resolver

748
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,159
in the architecture that we showed

749
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,399
before and uh

750
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,159
as as we see here the target instances

751
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,158
which are located in google cloud

752
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,200
and performing queries to three open

753
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
resolvers

754
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,520
have faster response time for google dns

755
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,879
because of potential co-location within

756
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,760
the same data center

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,679
compared to the other services and

758
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,760
integrating the oblivious target

759
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,440
into the recursive resolver can reduce

760
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,000
the the network latency

761
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,960
incurred uh to that of a cache hit for

762
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,520
uh for the answer and in the cache miss

763
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,360
cases incurring the network cost for the

764
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,039
recursive resolver to communicate with

765
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,879
the other name servers

766
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
so we find that co-locating these

767
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,600
services does

768
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,240
actually result in better performance

769
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,760
but to understand the performance of odo

770
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,399
we compare these to

771
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
other protocols offering similar privacy

772
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,918
and security guarantees

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
and use dough as the baseline protocol

774
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,600
which is shown here

775
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,640
on the indigo line to the left and the

776
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,320
dough over tar

777
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,720
is a variant of dough which provides

778
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,720
both security and privacy guarantees in

779
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
addition to some anonymity guarantees

780
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,320
and this is the beige line that you see

781
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,639
to the right of the figure

782
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,200
but when we compare this to odo we

783
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,120
notice odo with no service co-location

784
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,919
achieves an interesting position roughly

785
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,158
in between do and do over torque

786
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,320
and these results get interesting and

787
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,320
better as we start to co-locate

788
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
uh the target and the resolver together

789
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,279
which is shown by the dash blue line

790
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,600
over here

791
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,679
and we notice that the response time for

792
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,439
odo compared to doe for the baseline

793
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,120
increases by fifty percent

794
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,039
with service co-location and a hundred

795
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,520
percent when uh when the target and the

796
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,158
resolver are not co-located

797
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,240
but dns protocols uh with message

798
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,640
encryption like dns script

799
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,640
uh or anonymous dns script tend to have

800
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,039
much larger compute overheads

801
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,200
and use non-encrypted channels and these

802
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,360
protocols have higher response time

803
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,880
and lies somewhere in between odo and

804
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,479
doe over torr

805
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,919
which is which is over here in this in

806
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,399
this region uh on

807
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,080
on the graph and the performance of

808
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,000
these response times

809
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,279
with with odo somewhere being in the

810
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,520
middle ground

811
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,880
is very interesting uh is very

812
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,679
interesting for us

813
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,200
and but this brings us to a crucial

814
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
measurement that we're really interested

815
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
in the page load time impact

816
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,439
and to do this we establish a

817
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,440
measurement node in a lab network

818
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
with an available on path and a randomly

819
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,919
chosen off path proxy

820
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,000
and the node runs a local stub resolver

821
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,480
which is configured to use doe and odor

822
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,200
protocols for various runs and in each

823
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,120
run we

824
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,279
browse the same set of pages after

825
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,039
purging all the local cache entries

826
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,120
and perform page load time measurements

827
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,158
with selenium while using the navigation

828
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,840
events

829
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,840
our first measurements presented here

830
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,199
are pessimistic and use the worst case

831
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,519
network architecture

832
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,440
with no service co-location and only

833
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,000
considers the complete page load time

834
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,919
events

835
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,640
instead of other metrics like time to

836
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,720
first byte or the first useful paint

837
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,080
so additionally there are a lot of

838
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,519
various browser artifacts

839
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,840
like caching which happens within the

840
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,519
browser which and this is the reason why

841
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
the top graph over here

842
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,679
is quite different from uh from the

843
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
stress test measurements and the results

844
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,039
from this test

845
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,200
measurements that we've shown before but

846
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,200
what we find uh in in our preliminary

847
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,559
measurements is that using odo with an

848
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,960
onpath proxy

849
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,678
increases the page load time by 20

850
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,799
compared to

851
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,760
a baseline udp based dns usage or

852
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,158
doe and a randomly chosen off path proxy

853
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,000
actually increases this by 25 percent

854
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,559
so the page load times move from

855
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,120
somewhere between 1.319 seconds on an

856
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,480
average

857
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,918
to 1.6 seconds uh with odo these results

858
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,000
are still preliminary and we are

859
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,919
optimistic that with service co-location

860
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
these will get better but this is still

861
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,960
ongoing work

862
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,279
and to conclude odo is a practical

863
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,120
privacy enhancing protocol for dns

864
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,200
and it has minimal page load time

865
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,918
impacts and the performance impacts of

866
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,720
the protocol

867
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,559
are purely like network topology effects

868
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,320
uh we make a lot of recommendations in

869
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,840
our report for the ideal usage in

870
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,080
production systems like having an

871
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,320
ecosystem of on-path proxies

872
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,120
uh having service co-location and being

873
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,279
able to

874
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,320
and making the clients you do connection

875
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,320
reuse

876
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,080
uh all of the code and our

877
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
implementation is open source

878
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,879
and is available at these links on

879
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,158
github under the cloudflare organization

880
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,000
and we're committed to move this

881
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,880
standard forward in the ietf

882
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,559
and hope that more operators join us in

883
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,399
providing support for the protocol

884
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,039
either by running the proxies or the

885
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,199
targets and uh the report indicating our

886
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,240
measurements uh is also available

887
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,720
at this link here thank you i'm i'm open

888
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,720
to questions

889
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,600
thank you very much um so this is oh we

890
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
already have a queue so this is a kind

891
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,840
of brand new results right there's no

892
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,519
paper yet but you're working on one

893
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,799
so as soon as that becomes available

894
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,399
maybe you can also share it on the

895
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,399
mailing list

896
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,799
and with that we take first question

897
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
from mike

898
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,039
i think you have to i mean yeah yes

899
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,320
there you go

900
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,640
thank you uh so i was just wondering uh

901
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,519
does the work that you have here support

902
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,640
ecs

903
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,880
or edns client subnet

904
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,640
um because it seems like the

905
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,760
optimization that you're doing

906
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,639
um is really great for dns performance

907
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,320
um but on the other side of that

908
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,320
authoritative name servers may be

909
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,879
being used to try and do geolocation

910
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,199
based load balancing

911
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:26,639
um you know for our actual delivery

912
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,199
performance enhancement and if that

913
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,720
information is obscured uh what's what's

914
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,879
the balance have you have you looked

915
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,799
into that at all yet

916
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,319
so so we haven't actually performed a

917
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,440
lot of measurements for that

918
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,159
but to to the dns resolver

919
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,760
uh the proxy is essentially what what

920
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,560
they would see as the client

921
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,000
so any edns optimizations that that are

922
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,839
applied for say a proxy

923
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,359
in a specific geo location would

924
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,839
continue to be applied

925
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,159
uh it it probably becomes possible for

926
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,000
the client to choose a proxy that is

927
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,599
prop but that is maybe at a completely

928
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,160
different geo location

929
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,000
and that might have some effect on edns

930
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,000
but we haven't actively measured them

931
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:17,760
okay and mike you have another point

932
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,000
no then we have prime

933
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,520
hi sadie this is um really cool work

934
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,560
thanks a lot for sharing it

935
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,320
uh so uh actually your answer there is

936
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,240
is sort of a lead into my next question

937
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,880
so you're saying that you didn't really

938
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,919
look at

939
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,800
the um uh

940
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,440
the ability of or the impact of actively

941
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,400
choosing

942
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
a proxy um you know you could actively

943
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,280
choose a proxy either to

944
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,599
uh maximize the confusion right like the

945
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
maximum or minimize the identifiability

946
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,560
or also to

947
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,920
minimize latency what what i'm seeing in

948
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,119
these graphs though is that those two

949
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,599
tend to be

950
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,640
look like they're related to each other

951
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,800
you can either

952
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,240
maximize confusibility or you can max or

953
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,839
you can minimize latency

954
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,359
because the minimum latency path is

955
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,799
going to point kind of in the direction

956
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,640
that you're pointing in

957
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,640
so um

958
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,078
i i'm kind of wondering i actually would

959
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,598
like to see the follow-up work here sort

960
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,079
of dig into that particular question

961
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,440
like what is the actual latency cost of

962
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,880
additional um you know bits

963
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,480
of of um confusion about

964
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
uh who you are because it looks to me

965
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,520
like this basically takes the problem

966
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,320
that doe was originally intended to

967
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,960
solve

968
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
which is encrypt the the thing to a

969
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,720
gigantic

970
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,680
dns aggregator which will obscure who

971
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,680
you are

972
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,118
and because there's a a need to obscure

973
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,160
who you are from the gigantic dns

974
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,320
aggregator we're now going to use

975
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,520
smaller dns aggregators in the proxies

976
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,320
they will execute who you are from the

977
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,119
giant one but the giant one can still

978
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,079
kind of guess

979
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,720
at least geography based on the fact

980
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,079
that

981
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,439
everyone's going to implement for lowest

982
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
latency possible right because i mean

983
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,960
there's

984
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,000
the impact of of this over dns over

985
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,280
over um 53 you said is up to 20

986
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,560
which is actually kind of massive and

987
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,920
that's like that's just late in the

988
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,078
table so

989
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,359
um i guess that's more of a you know

990
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,680
please dig into that i i

991
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,960
i in the future i want to see sort of a

992
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,200
curve between

993
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,960
hey you know here's here's the x-axis of

994
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,560
how confused i want to be and here's the

995
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,040
y-axis of how much i have to pay for

996
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,480
that

997
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,759
because if that curve can be pushed down

998
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,960
then you can make a really good argument

999
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,839
that okay you should do this anyway

1000
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,920
you're going to take the hit

1001
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,880
but but it's worth it but if that curve

1002
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,760
is too high then yeah

1003
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,520
so i i think it's not only location it's

1004
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,359
also linkability right

1005
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,720
right so you're fixing the linkability

1006
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,000
problem but the but the

1007
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,520
but i mean if you're in a situation

1008
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,240
where only three people are behind a

1009
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,000
certain proxy then

1010
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,680
you know you need to get the mass and

1011
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,400
and you're you're kind of

1012
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,160
um uh you're kind of flipping the mass

1013
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,280
argument that doe was intended to solve

1014
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,879
in in the first place back around

1015
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,960
so comparing other architectural

1016
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,040
variants

1017
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
yeah i i think i think that's definitely

1018
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,800
like a very

1019
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,000
very valid suggestion but uh as jonathan

1020
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,119
i think pointed out in the

1021
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,040
chat along with uh he said that

1022
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,320
it's not in either or in most cases like

1023
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,000
you don't have to choose between one of

1024
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,560
them there are past probably ways in

1025
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
which

1026
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,240
we could scale them but it needs like

1027
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
this close collaboration

1028
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,240
uh to uh by a lot of operators and

1029
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,799
network operators to put some of these

1030
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,040
proxies on path and

1031
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,920
see and see how we can do this uh right

1032
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,520
but of course

1033
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,000
one of the things that we noticed is

1034
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,599
that uh there are quite a lot of people

1035
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,640
who do use dns script which is

1036
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,520
uh which is over here as this grey line

1037
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,920
that you see but the performance of odo

1038
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,160
is

1039
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,599
is like much better than dns script even

1040
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,759
in its workplace setting

1041
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,760
so

1042
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,320
cool all right thank you very much yeah

1043
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,640
thank you

1044
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,560
thanks uh we still have time we're

1045
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,240
really good in time that's really nice

1046
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,839
not used to that but we don't have

1047
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,040
anybody in the queue anymore

1048
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,040
so thank you very much for your

1049
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,440
presentation uh you can ask more

1050
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,520
questions in the chat everybody else

1051
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,720
we will move on to the next presentation

1052
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,400
and next we have

1053
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:11,598
sebastian talking about dns again

1054
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,599
are you able to share

1055
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
working on that

1056
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,680
okay somewhere else here we go

1057
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,200
yeah we can see a slide we can hear

1058
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,520
you're all set yeah already for the

1059
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,439
flickering i didn't notice that before

1060
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:42,079
um hello everybody nice to

1061
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,760
be here i only have five minutes and

1062
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,160
this is an accepted imc

1063
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:51,839
2020 paper uh so there is a longish

1064
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,118
version of this a presentation a

1065
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,799
video recording so you can go and make a

1066
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,839
reference to that

1067
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,880
uh this is a joint work between um

1068
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,680
sidn the dutch register

1069
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,200
domain by history the new zealand domain

1070
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,960
registry

1071
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,598
a root server operator

1072
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,480
we joined forces to go and find out how

1073
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,960
the clouds

1074
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,920
are centralizing dns traffic

1075
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,400
so as you may may know and i have plenty

1076
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,839
of slides to go and justify this point

1077
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,319
there are concerns from the us and the

1078
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,440
european union about centralization of

1079
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,680
platforms and centralization of internet

1080
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,560
infrastructure

1081
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,200
so they are hearings about an antitrust

1082
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,640
and you've

1083
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,640
heard well facebook in there being a

1084
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,240
social media company or twitter having

1085
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,480
too much power

1086
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,560
um about how are they creating

1087
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,520
a single point of failure a point where

1088
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,599
they decide

1089
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:03,359
what is good what is bad um

1090
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,800
undermining privacy of users and also

1091
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,960
market consolidation so

1092
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,720
our intent with this work is if

1093
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
we can do anything to go and measure

1094
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,759
internet centralization

1095
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,839
and you can pick any metric you

1096
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,760
may want on this the number of uses the

1097
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,160
amount of traffic

1098
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,599
network infrastructure as a mailing

1099
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,799
presented

1100
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,000
a little bit a few minutes ago computer

1101
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,040
infrastructure

1102
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,040
market power market share

1103
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,640
but because of all of our three uh

1104
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:44,079
dns organizations we focus on

1105
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,279
dns traffic that's mainly coming from

1106
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,960
resolvers to

1107
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,520
authoritative servers so and we provide

1108
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,640
you with

1109
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,000
a three different vantage points so we

1110
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,200
have

1111
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,079
using a passive dns so

1112
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,118
packet captures we have the dns traffic

1113
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,240
going to

1114
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,920
door dornell the netherlands with

1115
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,959
official language touch

1116
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,319
new zealand english maori and

1117
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,880
sign language and

1118
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,880
be root

1119
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,279
and we focus our efforts on and

1120
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,359
measuring from

1121
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,880
five different cloud and content

1122
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,119
providers so google

1123
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,079
amazon microsoft facebook and cloudflare

1124
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,359
uh two of those cloudflare and google as

1125
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,119
you know and as you heard from the

1126
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,400
previous presentation they have public

1127
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,240
dns

1128
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,640
so we would expect to see a lot of

1129
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,319
traffic from them

1130
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,839
we did a lot of the aggregations a lot

1131
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,240
of analysis you can go in

1132
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,200
and take a look at the paper but what we

1133
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,879
can find and what

1134
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,919
i can quickly share here is um

1135
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,760
for example the different how using

1136
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,319
different

1137
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
weeks of data in different years the

1138
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,599
traffic

1139
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,119
has been growing so you can see for be

1140
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,359
root

1141
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,560
the traffic coming from uh those five

1142
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,078
cloud providers

1143
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:11,200
basically double in amateur for a year

1144
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,640
and they stay the same in 2020

1145
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,359
uh however the root servers

1146
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,200
and the cctv in the tld space are

1147
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,560
completely different beats

1148
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,560
and you can see if uh for new zealand

1149
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,440
almost a third of the traffic comes from

1150
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,480
those five cloud providers

1151
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,480
which for the netherlands is even worse

1152
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,200
and you can see if i go back and forth

1153
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,440
that the amount of traffic

1154
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,598
the netherlands gets from google is

1155
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,880
around 15 percent of the

1156
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
total load

1157
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,078
we can focus on different aspects but

1158
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,119
basically

1159
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,520
we can see from ipv4 ipv6 options and at

1160
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,800
the end of the slides i have a

1161
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:00,000
beautiful picture that shows uh google

1162
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,280
and cloudflare

1163
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,079
basically share the traffic between ipv4

1164
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,720
and ipv6

1165
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,440
but facebook is starting sending more

1166
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,399
and more

1167
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,119
ipv6 traffic and the microsoft and

1168
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:18,560
amazon barely use ipv6 as

1169
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,560
a transport

1170
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,720
uh if we focus on dns by different

1171
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,079
query types you can see the patterns

1172
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,118
and the thing the footprint of each of

1173
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,960
the cloud providers

1174
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,800
are completely different and you can see

1175
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,000
on google and specifically in 2020

1176
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:47,760
how the amount of traffic they send for

1177
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,760
the ns queries uh drastically change

1178
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,480
um the reason for that and i have a

1179
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,040
pretty picture

1180
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,319
here is basically because google

1181
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,560
deployed q name

1182
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:04,079
minimization in december 2019

1183
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,319
which leads us to uh part of our

1184
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,160
conclusions that if a cloud provider

1185
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,680
decides to go and adopt

1186
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,240
a certain technology ietf technology

1187
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,598
you will see a massive change either

1188
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,040
dnsec

1189
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,480
udp versus tcp etc so

1190
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,119
there are pros and cons of

1191
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,480
centralization and again i'll invite you

1192
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,520
to go and check the video presentation

1193
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,400
on imc

1194
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:35,599
ripe or dns org or read the paper

1195
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,440
okay um thanks a lot

1196
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,560
also um very interesting talk about a

1197
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,480
important topic we're discussing uh we

1198
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:47,839
are still good in time so we still have

1199
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,839
time for questions here

1200
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,520
right so well george is pointing out uh

1201
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,960
cuny an immunization is sort of a

1202
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,440
country example of

1203
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,400
where a consent market concentration is

1204
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:05,040
a good thing

1205
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,680
to have and i'm pretty sure there are

1206
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,720
other

1207
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,919
options so google also does

1208
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,399
dns validation and because

1209
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,200
the netherlands has a lot of uh you know

1210
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,440
domain names

1211
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:20,319
it's likely an explanation for why it

1212
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,040
isn't receiving so much traffic

1213
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:24,319
uh cloudflare is also that's a dns

1214
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,359
equalization so

1215
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:30,960
if the idf come out comes up with a

1216
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:34,078
new technology or a new

1217
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,200
in s query type that might be

1218
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,720
very useful for users this micro

1219
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,720
concentration will be very helpful for

1220
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,839
them

1221
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:51,839
i don't see a lot of um questions

1222
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,480
no i'm still waiting for a little moment

1223
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,160
because

1224
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,920
we as i said have time um i also

1225
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
recommend everybody to read the full

1226
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,920
paper

1227
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:05,520
um really good paper yes

1228
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,560
if we have more time i can show you uh

1229
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,119
one more thing which surprises us so

1230
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:13,520
most of the traffic

1231
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,400
received by the netherlands and new

1232
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,880
zealand

1233
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:22,240
is a udp traffic except for facebook

1234
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,240
so facebook has a

1235
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:30,960
non negligible amount of tcp traffic

1236
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,839
and by checking the

1237
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,359
edns buffer size we notice they're using

1238
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,000
a very small

1239
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,598
buffer size so they're likely querying

1240
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,119
for something and they not then they

1241
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,640
have to go and retry

1242
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,640
on tcp the same query late

1243
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,400
yes so maybe something to discuss on the

1244
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,760
map or gmail list

1245
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,760
there might be people from facebook

1246
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,920
but i don't know oh yeah definitely

1247
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
thank you very much for your

1248
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,720
presentation

1249
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,720
and with that i think we move on

1250
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,960
next we have oliver um

1251
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,400

thank you awesome okay perfect so hi

1258
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,400
everyone my name is

1259
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:34,000
oliver gasser i'm a postdoc researcher

1260
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,559
at the max planck institute

1261
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,599
for informatics in germany and today i'm

1262
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,640
going to present

1263
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,960
a short excerpt from our study on

1264
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,359
the so-called lockdown effect namely the

1265
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,760
implications of the kovit-19 pandemic on

1266
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,720
internet traffic

1267
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,160
as you all know uh right around march a

1268
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,558
large part of the

1269
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,399
overall population of the world uh went

1270
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:58,480
into the so-called lockdown

1271
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,599
which means that people were now working

1272
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,280
from home they were

1273
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:04,160
studying from home and teaching from

1274
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,720
home and also parts of the social life

1275
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,440
um moved online and in all of these

1276
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,759
efforts

1277
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,280
the internet is obviously essential and

1278
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,119
so we asked ourselves

1279
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,640
how well does the internet actually cope

1280
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:19,839
with this kind of change and

1281
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,879
we looked at a lot of data namely um a

1282
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,880
large european isp and three internet

1283
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,800
exchange points one located in central

1284
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,200
europe one in southern europe and one

1285
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,559
at the us east coast and also at an

1286
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,000
academic network

1287
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,079
ready madrid which is a university

1288
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,720
network in spain and

1289
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,920
to analyze uh all of these data we

1290
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,799
assembled quite a large

1291
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,839
group of people from different research

1292
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,599
institutions as well as

1293
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,319
companies so let's get right started the

1294
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,720
first

1295
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,960
analysis that i want to present to you

1296
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,118
is how does the traffic actually change

1297
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,359
during the lockdown what you see in this

1298
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,440
graph on the x-axis you see the

1299
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:59,119
calendar week all the way back from

1300
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,599
january 2019

1301
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,880
to june 2020 and you see a horizontal

1302
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,520
line where you have the uh

1303
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,640
year change from 2019 to 2020 as well as

1304
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,720
some specific

1305
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,839
dates noted for example the kovic 19

1306
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,598
outbreak

1307
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:13,680
as well as the initial responses and

1308
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,200
lockdowns and on the y-axis you

1309
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,960
basically see the normalized

1310
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,399
traffic volume which means that whenever

1311
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,920
the line goes up traffic

1312
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,160
increases and whenever the line goes

1313
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,559
down traffic decreases

1314
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,879
and the blue line in this graph shows

1315
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,880
the traffic volume for the isp

1316
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,720
and what you see there is that right

1317
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,480
around the initial responses and

1318
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,720
lockdowns you see a

1319
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,119
about 30 percent increase in traffic

1320
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,839
which would normally span over

1321
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,400
multiple months within just a short a

1322
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:44,640
period of time

1323
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,839
if we now look at the internet exchange

1324
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,319
points in gray

1325
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,359
we see a quite similar behavior there

1326
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,640
and for some of the

1327
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:54,000
ixps the traffic level remains elevated

1328
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,799
even after some of the lockdown

1329
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
restrictions

1330
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,720
have been lifted now looking at a

1331
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,720
different

1332
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,558
network again which is the mobile

1333
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,040
operator network

1334
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,720
in orange which behaves completely

1335
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,319
different compared to the other network

1336
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,118
that we've already seen

1337
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:11,520
namely during the lockdown the traffic

1338
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,839
goes

1339
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:15,759
actually down which makes sense when you

1340
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,359
think about it because people were

1341
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,800
more staying at home and not moving

1342
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,000
outside anymore

1343
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,200
so they didn't use the mobile network as

1344
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,520
much as before

1345
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,640
and also once some of the lockdown

1346
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,280
restrictions

1347
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,400
were lifted right around at the end of

1348
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,000
april

1349
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,920
mobile traffic starts to pick up again

1350
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,359
so now that we've looked at the overall

1351
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,839
uh traffic uh

1352
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:40,720
um traffic volume characteristics over

1353
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,960
several months

1354
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,720
let's look at a more detailed picture

1355
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,960
namely how does

1356
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,640
uh traffic change within a day and for

1357
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,280
this we're going to

1358
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:52,240
look at a working day as well as a

1359
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,720
weekend day

1360
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,839
and so we picked a working day which is

1361
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,439
february 19th

1362
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,200
before the pandemic before the lockdowns

1363
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,200
and what you see on the x-axis is

1364
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:05,359
basically the hour of the day

1365
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,279
and the y axis again the traffic volume

1366
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:10,400
and we see how is the traffic

1367
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,920
volume distributed over the day and

1368
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,520
what we see before the lockdown is that

1369
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,520
on working days there is a strong

1370
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,480
increase in traffic towards the evening

1371
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,520
hours

1372
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,200
um if we compare this to a weekend day

1373
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,720
we see that the traffic is more equally

1374
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:30,480
distributed over the complete day

1375
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,520
now if we compare this to a working day

1376
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,559
during the lockdown we see that

1377
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,040
the traffic more resembles um

1378
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,040
a working day compared to a weekend day

1379
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,520
so work days actually

1380
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,839
start to look more like weekends from a

1381
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,599
traffic

1382
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:51,599
characteristic and finally the last

1383
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:55,280
um analysis that i want to show you is

1384
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,880
we also looked at different applications

1385
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,359
how traffic for different applications

1386
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,880
changed and one of one important

1387
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:03,680
applications when you're working from

1388
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,040
home as is vpn so we applied

1389
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,558
a port base as well as a domain based

1390
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:13,520
technique to identify vpn traffic

1391
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,880
and in this left part of the graph you

1392
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,400
see on the upper part of the graph you

1393
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,440
see the traffic

1394
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,480
volume for workdays so again if the bar

1395
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,880
is higher you have more

1396
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,240
traffic more vpn traffic there and on

1397
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,680
the lower part you see the traffic

1398
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,720
volume for weekends

1399
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,240
and this is the um traffic the vpn

1400
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,640
traffic for february

1401
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,078
if we now compare this with march we see

1402
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,118
that there is about a

1403
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,520
200 increase in vpn traffic

1404
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:42,480
uh mostly during uh during the working

1405
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,640
days in working hours

1406
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,680
if we look a little bit more further in

1407
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,200
time so

1408
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,279
at april and june we see that the vpn

1409
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,558
traffic starts to slightly decrease

1410
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,680
again but it's still

1411
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,359
the volume is still above the initial

1412
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,319
volume that we've seen in february

1413
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:03,119
so what are our main takeaways from this

1414
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,920
paper

1415
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:06,960
we saw that traffic increased between 15

1416
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,760
and 30 percent

1417
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,160
within just a few days the difference

1418
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,319
between

1419
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,759
the work days and weekends starts to

1420
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,680
vanish

1421
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,040
and also specific applications for

1422
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,680
remote work such as

1423
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,720
vpn and video conferencing saw quite a

1424
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,000
large increase

1425
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,000
in traffic there is a lot more

1426
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,280
in the paper which we've presented at

1427
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,800
imc 2020.

1428
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,880
for example we look at changes in

1429
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,000
transport ports different

1430
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,800
traffic classes we also investigate how

1431
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,720
does

1432
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,400
a traffic in an educational network

1433
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,078
change during the pandemic when students

1434
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,319
are staying

1435
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,839
off of the campus and at home and we

1436
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,880
also compare hyper giants versus

1437
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:49,279
non-hyper giants and much more

1438
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,240
that was it from my side happy to take

1439
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,400
any questions

1440
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,759
thank you very much we do have like one

1441
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
or two minutes for questions

1442
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,079
um i also uh wanted to mention i forgot

1443
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,240
this earlier that this is like only

1444
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,200
maybe not fully in scope from apache but

1445
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,040
we thought given

1446
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:07,279
um the current circumstances might be

1447
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,000
interesting it's a very comprehensive

1448
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,240
paper

1449
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,359
with a lot of different measurements and

1450
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,839
there are also more

1451
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,680
papers at imc at the internet

1452
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,640
measurement conference so if you look up

1453
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,558
the

1454
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,558
the agenda from the last imc conference

1455
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,160
which was just like a few weeks ago

1456
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,160
you find more interesting papers about

1457
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,640
these kind of effects

1458
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,118
let's see we have people in the queue so

1459
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,118
jonathan

1460
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,599
and did you look at how weekend traffic

1461
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:36,480
changed i

1462
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,440
was we did weekends just look the same

1463
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,599
or

1464
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,599
have weekends become even more flat

1465
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,079
uh so weekends you you're talking about

1466
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,160
weekends

1467
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,839
yeah because you said that um normal

1468
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,000
traffic looks more like weekends what

1469
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,640
does we can do yes

1470
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,680
ah um so that's so weekend traffic still

1471
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,400
looks like uh

1472
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,799
weekend traffic more or less so it's the

1473
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,200
the

1474
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,960
the main thing that changes is the

1475
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,319
working day traffic so i can

1476
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,880
maybe show uh a backup slide which i

1477
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,880
have here

1478
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,720
and what what you see here is basically

1479
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,040
we're trying to classify

1480
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,078
um from the traffic characteristics

1481
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,880
whether a

1482
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,839
uh a day looks more like a weekend or it

1483
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,720
looks more like a

1484
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:22,400
a working day and on the lower part you

1485
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,200
see the

1486
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,160
the days classified as working days on

1487
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,520
the upper part

1488
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,839
you see days classified as weekends and

1489
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,680
all of the blue bars are classified

1490
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,279
correctly so here for example we have

1491
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,359
the weekends classified correctly here

1492
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,920
we have working days classified

1493
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,759
correctly

1494
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,200
and what you see is that the weekends

1495
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,839
remain uh

1496
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,240
classified correctly so they're still

1497
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,599
behaving

1498
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,598
like weekends

1499
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:57,040
okay thank you we have uh

1500
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,040
one quick question from spencer

1501
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:04,480

okay yeah uh hi everybody i'm marcus

1522
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,520
from rwt

1523
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,558
university and i would like to summarize

1524
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,400
our results

1525
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,640
of the analysis of the security

1526
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,599
configuration of internet facing opcwa

1527
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,400
deployments

1528
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,079
so opcoa is one of the most recent

1529
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,119
industrial communication protocols which

1530
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,839
was designed with

1531
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,640
security in mind making it a prime

1532
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,720
candidate for

1533
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:14,160
communication in the industry 4.0 and

1534
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,839
the industrial internet of things for

1535
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,558
example to control productions via the

1536
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,400
internet

1537
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,400
and indeed these security features of

1538
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,079
opcoa are approved for example by the

1539
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,839
federal office for information security

1540
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,760
in germany however to actually achieve

1541
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,558
this level of security which is promised

1542
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,200
by opc

1543
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,760
a extensive configuration is required

1544
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,839
and

1545
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,079
to guide operators through this

1546
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:39,040
extensive configuration process the opc

1547
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,960
foundation published official security

1548
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,119
configuration recommendations

1549
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,400
however the questions still persist

1550
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,640
whether

1551
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,160
internet facing or pc or a deployments

1552
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,839
are configured securely

1553
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:52,799
and you might ask why this is relevant

1554
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:54,160
for the itf as opcwa is now idf protocol

1555
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,280
but we think that this

1556
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,759
might be only a key example for secure

1557
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,799
by

1558
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:03,200
design protocols in general so let's get

1559
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:04,480
into it so first we have to find opc a

1560
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,839
deployments on the internet

1561
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,079
so we performed active internet

1562
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:09,839
measurements weekly over a period of

1563
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,839
seven months using zmapp

1564
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,520
on the standalone pcr a port and

1565
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:15,759
subsequently retrieved

1566
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,440
security configurations and publicly

1567
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,520
available payload data

1568
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,520
and indeed we found industry deployments

1569
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,280
using the opc ui protocol

1570
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:27,440
um between 1 700 and 2000 of these

1571
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,640
deployments were reachable over the

1572
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,319
internet in the ipv4 address space and

1573
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,000
42 of them are discovery servers which

1574
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:38,720
means that they are only used to

1575
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,920
announce opc os deployments on other ip

1576
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:42,319
port combinations

1577
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:43,680
and we focused on the non discovery

1578
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,440
service here as the security

1579
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:48,960
configuration is only relevant

1580
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,160
for the actual payload transmission and

1581
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,559
yeah then we answer the question whether

1582
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:57,680
these are configured securely

1583
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:58,559
looking into the security configurations

1584
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,480
of these

1585
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,480
deployments first looking into the

1586
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,720
security mode which basically enables or

1587
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,359
disables communication security features

1588
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,480
for example uh confidentiality and or

1589
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,400
authenticity

1590
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,920
and here one out of three modes

1591
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,799
completely disables the communication

1592
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,480
security

1593
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:16,400
and we found that one-fourth of all

1594
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,079
deployments actually uses this

1595
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,799
uh one mode um basically neglecting all

1596
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,839
of the

1597
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,559
um obc a security benefits and do not

1598
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,040
offering

1599
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,720
communication security at all and

1600
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,040
furthermore

1601
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,078
um we looked into the security policies

1602
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,079
which define

1603
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:35,920
security primitives to be used to

1604
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,640
implement these selected security

1605
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,640
features

1606
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,520
and here three out of six policies are

1607
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,319
not considerable as not secure

1608
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,359
and two of them because two of them are

1609
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,400
deprecated

1610
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:48,799
due to the usage of sha-1 and we found

1611
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,960
that

1612
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:55,040
despite these were deprecated in 2017

1613
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,400
one fourth of all deployments that offer

1614
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,720
security

1615
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,760
use these still use these deprecated

1616
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,319
policies

1617
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,359
and more interestingly we found that

1618
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,960
only one

1619
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,520
point four percent of the servers we

1620
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,760
found um enforce the usage of

1621
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,480
secure policies which were recommended

1622
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,880
by the opc foundation

1623
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,559
we also looked into whether the

1624
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,760
deployments implemented

1625
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,280
the security policies correctly for by

1626
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,680
looking into these certificates the

1627
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,240
service used for authentication

1628
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,960
and found that um thirty percent of the

1629
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,439
servers

1630
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,440
use two weak certificates um which do

1631
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,079
not meet the minimum requirements of the

1632
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,480
security policies for example key length

1633
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,520
or

1634
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,640
um yeah hash algorithm um that was used

1635
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:41,839
to generate those

1636
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,799
certificates and furthermore in we

1637
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:44,720
detected

1638
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,319
one or we detected several cases of

1639
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,720
certificate reuse and one was

1640
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,440
most striking as one certificate was

1641
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,040
deployed

1642
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,599
on more than 380 devices which we think

1643
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,240
are operated by different operators

1644
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:57,520
which we

1645
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,240
derived from the discussion with the

1646
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,280
manufacturer looking into the third

1647
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,200
aspect of the

1648
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,559
security concept we also looked into

1649
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:08,879
authentication and found that 44

1650
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,720
of the deployments do not implement

1651
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,760
access control meaning that everybody on

1652
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:14,879
the internet

1653
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,520
um can access these servers without

1654
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,319
authenticating itself um and we also

1655
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:20,720
looked into the

1656
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,000
um payload data of these deployments and

1657
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,799
found

1658
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,680
that these are actual production systems

1659
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:29,440
as of

1660
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,520
our judgment so our results underpin

1661
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,760
that deploying a secure

1662
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:35,119
by design protocol is not sufficient but

1663
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,200
it requires of course

1664
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:41,280
a secure configuration and we think that

1665
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,319
also standardization could somehow help

1666
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,000
for that

1667
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:45,680
for example by specifying that

1668
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,200
implementations have to ship with

1669
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:52,160
secure by default configuration

1670
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,799
yeah our papers are available on archive

1671
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,399
and

1672
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,240
we also published our data set in our

1673
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,640
scanner so thank you very much for your

1674
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,640
attention

1675
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,920
thank you max sorry that you now were a

1676
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,720
little bit time squeezed here

1677
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,359
um but also i recommend really to read

1678
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,359
the paper

1679
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,520
um i think even though this is not an

1680
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,000
itf protocol it's a really good example

1681
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,759
about

1682
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,440
what can go wrong i think like you ended

1683
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,440
up with over 90

1684
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,920
of uh deployed systems that have like

1685
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:22,799
some kind of a security flaw

1686
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,720
um even so recommendations exist so um i

1687
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,400
think this is a good lesson learned read

1688
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,000
so people should read the paper and look

1689
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,839
at this and we should consider this in

1690
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,359
