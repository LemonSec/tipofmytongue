5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
join

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,240
and while we'll go through the

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,279
introductory slides we are looking for

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,399

your muted rod uh the unmuting took took

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,839
several seconds

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,839
otherwise you may have to volunteer

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
somebody

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
yeah so while people are thinking about

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,159
volunteering i'll

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
go through the usual note well

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,520
well as seen on the screen

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,840
i'll give it a few seconds

22
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,840
few more seconds for the next slide

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,839
and the goals of the irtf

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,080
all right so while people are joining

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
before i start with the rest of the

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,760
chair slides we are still looking for a

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,359
jumper scribe and a minute

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
taker being a jumper scribe is pretty

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,879
simple uh

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
oh bruno just says he doesn't see the

31
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,359
slices

32
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,200
nobody see the slides or do people

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
actually see the slides

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,839
there's a presentation view button at

35
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,839
the top

36
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,640
okay

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
well for bruno there's a presentation

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,200
button on the top so

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
maybe that's it uh anyway we're still

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:05,839
looking for

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:05,840
jabber's crab and minute taker volunteer

42
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
um

43
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,720
[Music]

44
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,518
right jab prescribe this should be

45
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,319
actually fairly straightforward

46
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,200
in the online meeting and minute taking

47
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,798
should

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,159
also hopefully not be too difficult

49
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:47,840
given that we're actually a fairly

50
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:47,840
spaced out session

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,159
uh bruno yeah

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
my mute and unmute button has extremely

53
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
high latency like

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
bruno you're asking to uh to uh share

55
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:15,840
the screen which i don't think is what

56
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:15,840
you wanted to do is it

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,478
what you wanted to do at the top in the

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,479
right

59
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,599
there's a series of icons the left most

60
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,440
of those is

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,639
presentation view not your own not to

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,160
share your own screen but to to

63
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,600
it should be right about the middle of

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,600
your screen at the top or at least it is

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
online

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:53,919
uh nobody volunteering for

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,919
minutes taking shelter can do it

68
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,960
short online you want to

69
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,960
be the uh note taker

70
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,599
i see him online i'm not sure if he's

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:16,159
hearing us or not let's see

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
can't see slides or rodney or hear audio

73
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,360
that's interesting

74
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,840
is there audio i can't hear anything

75
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,039
seems to be working okay for me yeah

76
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,080
some people do hear us because people do

77
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
react in the chat

78
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,039
to some of my questions

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,638
let me just re-share the screen

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,000
see if that works

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,360

and then let us know if we're missing

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,560

97
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560

uh so the agenda for today is to spend

100
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
the first 10 minutes

101

103
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:16,000
and other online issues

104
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,198
uh hopefully we've got most of that out

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
of the way now

106
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,599
uh we'll then go for a talk about

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,199
measurement device

108
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
measurement device independent quantum

109
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
key distribution by josh slater

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,120
uh it says 20 minutes but it will

111
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,599
actually be 30 minutes as a typo

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,479
then chongang will talk about the use

113
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,880
case draft

114
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
draft

116
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
and then we'll have an open flow

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,759
what's the status of the rg uh

118
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,120
shortly after the july uh

119
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,080
meeting uh

120
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,039
we basically during around the time of

121
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
our july meeting

122
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,400
the department of energy in the usa

123
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,160
announced uh

124
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
the usa blueprint for the quantum

125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,840
internet uh

126
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,400
and with colin's uh encouragement uh

127
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,479
rod and i wrote a blog post to promote

128
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,638
the qrg activities the blog post is

129
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,039
online it's on the ietf blog

130
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,319
uh links are in the slides uh

131
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,680
and yeah uh it's still on my wall it's

132
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,840
still online so

133
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
feel free to share as well

134
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
and also the fact that the usa has

135
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
announced that blueprint for the

136
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
controversy is quite exciting

137
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,000
uh it's clearly showing there's momentum

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,680
in this field

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,679
so it's great to see that

140
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,040
uh other than that what's the current

141
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
document status

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,279
uh the principles is basically

143
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,160
almost ready for uh was basically i

144
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,600
think ready for

145
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,719
last call but we'll see today at the

146
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,399
meeting the use case draft is

147
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,080
almost there as well we'll be discussing

148
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,880
some

149
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
on that today and there's three expired

150
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,920
drafts which

151
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
are expired but people do every now and

152
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,319
then keep asking about them

153
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
and there is uh they are of interest

154
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
it's just that they'll have to at some

155
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
point be picked up

156
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
again uh when somebody finds them

157
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,519
interesting

158
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,519
again other than that uh this is my

159
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
android's proposal for what we will be

160
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
doing uh

161
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,880
subsequently because two of the active

162
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,959
documents are kind of being wrapped up

163
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,720
so we will rather focus now on education

164
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,560
we'll try to focus mostly on talks like

165
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
the one that will be coming up

166
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,839
from researchers on current topics

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,680
uh we might shift to fewer ietf meetings

168
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,120
in favor of more interims which are just

169
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,160
shorter and more about

170
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,720
just getting up to speed with more with

171
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
what's currently being worked on uh

172
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,839
although that is not to say that

173
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,439
internet draft rfc work will stop

174
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,959
we can still keep doing that uh just

175
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,240
that that's going to still keep

176
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,719
happening it will still be meeting at

177
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,959
ietf meetings

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,320
with that said uh rodney do you have

179
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,319
anything to add to that

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,720
nothing in particular just in my

181
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:23,120
helicopter flying overhead

182
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
okay so uh

183
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,079
right so i would like to also introduce

184
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,839
our first speaker

185
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,839
uh josh would you like to share your

186
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,839
slides whilst i introduce you

187
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:42,880
so josh later doctors later

188
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,200
has been doing quantum mechanics

189
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,640
for over 15 years now

190
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
he started in the area of quantum

191
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,399
computing as a quantum algorithm

192
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,600
scientist for canada's d-wave systems in

193
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,800
vancouver

194
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
and then the institute for quantum

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,959
computing in waterloo afterwards he

196
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
decided to head to graduate school

197
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,239
and made the switch to the quantum

198
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,160
internet uh

199
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,000
in 2014 he finished his phd in calgary

200
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,000
canada performing several important

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,519
experiments in quantum communications

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,519
quantum entanglement quantum repeaters

203
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
and quantum photography

204
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,800
for example the first field

205
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,000
demonstrations of mdiqd

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
which you'll be talking about

207
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
josh led the team of students that built

208
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,120
uh

209
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,519
calgary's three-note quantum crypto

210
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,880
network and after his phd he did a

211
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
postdoc at the university of vienna in

212
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,519
austria

213
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
uh where he worked on the interface of

214
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,800
quantum sensing and quantum gravity

215
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,000
uh and so having had a whole range of

216
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
experience in quantum

217
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,959
he joined q-tech in the netherlands

218
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,640
where he was a quantum scientist

219
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,239
engineer leading one of the engineering

220
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
teams focused on raising the

221
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
technology readiness level of quantum

222
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,560
communications

223
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,040
and building quantum internet

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
deployments

225
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,839
let me now grant his screen and i will

226
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,839
let josh do the talking now

227
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,839
great thank you for check thank you for

228
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,320
the introduction and uh good morning

229
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
everyone

230
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,079
yeah my name is joshua slater i'm at

231
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,639
qtac

232
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,399
in the netherlands so it's about 6 a.m

233
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,800
uh in the morning

234
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,000
right now and this is my first time

235
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,240
being at a

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,600
the qirg or irtf

237
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,079
i etf any of these uh sorts of meetings

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
this is kind of exciting and fun to see

239
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,319
what happens here

240
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
i i was asked to give a little bit of a

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
talk about

242
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,079
mdiqd and i said well what kinds of

243
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,959
things in particular might this

244
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,199
group of people be interested in and i

245
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,479
received a list of i think eight or so

246
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,839
different

247
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
topics and and questions so and a lot of

248
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
them were more about quantum internet

249
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
than uh mdiq

250
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,240
itself so i decided to say a few things

251
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,040
about uh quantum internet too

252
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,560
so josh you're uh you're not sharing

253
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,439
video i don't know if you intended to or

254
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,638
not so so

255
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
we have your slides but we don't have

256
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,000
the view of you sure i don't know if

257
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,760
that is

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
up to you whether you want to share it

259
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
but i know your camera works because we

260
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,560
saw it during the test session

261
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,600
because you saw me earlier i can share

262
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,680
video here we go there we go

263
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,120
good looks good

264
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
thank you thank you for the nice

265
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
compliment okay good

266
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,360
so um what is the quantum internet i

267
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,200
guess everyone in here knows but just to

268
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,120
be clear a quantum

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
the quantum internet will be a quantum

270
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,320
communication network that will exploit

271
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
the properties of light

272
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,440
whether or not you know about qubits it

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
doesn't really matter as long as you

274
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
know

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
this is what we're trying to do exploit

276
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,638
the properties of light

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,279
and that's for a number of different

278
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,600
reasons for instance there

279
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,839
could be users that say i have important

280
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,839
documents i want to authenticate it

281
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,600
there could be users that say i have

282
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,480
some particular chunk of quantum data

283
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
and i want to get this

284
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
into a quantum computer that will need a

285
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,399
quantum internet to do this

286
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,920
and there might also be quantum

287
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,199
computers situated somewhere in the

288
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,040
quantum internet

289
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,120
and these quantum computers might want

290
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,040
to connect to other quantum computers

291
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
share entanglement share quantum states

292
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,719
for some kind of cloud quantum computing

293
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
these are the kinds of uh people we

294
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,600
imagine will be using

295
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:18,160
the quantum internet so

296
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,040
that was a little why we want to build

297
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
it let's say

298
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
let's start with something a bit fun

299
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,560
which is the top seven facts just so

300
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,599
we're all

301
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,279
on the same board here the first is that

302
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,040
the quantum internet will use quantum

303
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,160
technology to provide quantum services

304
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,399
to users

305
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
i think we all agree on this the next

306
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,639
one which i

307
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
hear sometimes some people ask me if the

308
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
quantum internet will replace the

309
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,079
conventional internet and of course the

310
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,560
fact

311
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,519
there is no quantum will not replace the

312
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,880
conventional

313
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
internet the conventional networks it's

314
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,519
only going to supplement it with new

315
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,119
functionality third fact is our

316
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,000
communication channels are definitely

317
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,199
going to be

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,199
optical we have no way in

319
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,120
in the physics world to make qubits with

320
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,800
radio waves we don't know how to detect

321
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
qubits with microwaves

322
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,240
all that well so we are definitely

323
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,639
looking in the optical domain

324
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
and we will definitely be using fiber

325
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,920
optics in particular we need

326
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,639
low loss especially right now low loss

327
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,880
optics

328
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,560
fiber optics between locations typically

329
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,880
something like 30 db

330
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,959
with no conventional active elements

331
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,399
between them

332
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,239
we can make just about everything that's

333
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,120
needed for the quantum internet into

334
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,720
19-inch rack compatible modules we do

335
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,920
this for a number of our modules

336
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,360
others are doing this as well

337
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,279
we are going to need infrastructure

338
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
locations and those infrastructure

339
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,600
locations

340
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
will have to be responsible for the

341
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
support

342
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,519
and for the security for instance the

343
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,000
energy

344
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,759
for instance cooling if we are talking

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,800
about security which we'll get into a

346
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,880
little bit later

347
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,279
then they need to be responsible for

348
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
things like access controls and logging

349
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,040
and then there are some questions there

350
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,920
some some open questions still like what

351
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,319
kind of

352
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,759
specialized technology or specialized um

353
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
support can we expect from these

354
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
locations like dry cryo cooling or

355
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,600
compressed gases

356
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,360
if you have opinions on that i think it

357
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,800
would be great to know these feel free

358
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
to drop that into the chat

359
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
they can drop things into the chat while

360
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,880
i'm speaking right

361
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,399
okay yeah great uh also redundancy we

362
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,639
can build redundancy into the quantum

363
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,320
network i could ask this a lot

364
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,320
um we can do this though the best

365
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
techniques haven't been explored yet

366
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
and the eighth not really a fact but

367
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,360
there's really a lot of uncertainty

368
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
still we don't know

369
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
who's going to be building the hardware

370
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
for this we don't know where it's going

371
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
to be laid down

372
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
we don't know how much control is going

373
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,360
to come from agencies like governments

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,720
for instance

375
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
and we also don't know how we're going

376
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,240
to get to a full-blown quantum internet

377
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,600
nevertheless we have um something of a

378
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,079
road map that has been

379
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,920
developed at various stages qtec had a

380
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,040
particular paper on this about two years

381
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,360
ago

382
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
which inc the way we lay out this

383
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
roadmap is going from

384
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,760
certain low-level functionality like

385
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,439
just point-to-point cuba transmission

386
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,199
and increasing quantum functionality

387
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
over time so we're down here right now

388
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,000
point-to-point cubic transmission these

389
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,679
are commercial products

390
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
you might be aware that you could buy

391
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,679
these things and these commercial

392
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,199
products

393
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,919
allow for things like quantum key

394
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,199
distribution at the moment without end

395
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
to end security

396
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,720
and that quantum key distribution is for

397
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,000
applications in encryption

398
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
authentication and whatever else you

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
might use a key for what is

400
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,159
slowly coming out now ready for

401
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,360
industrial development is multi-point to

402
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,160
multi-point qubit

403
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
transmission so that is for things where

404
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,960
you have a larger network and you can do

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,480
end-to-end security across this network

406
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
still up to some distance limitations

407
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,320
which i'll get to um

408
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,000
again for encryption and authentication

409
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,678
but other applications like password

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,080
verification position verification

411
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,080
there's a few other things

412
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,520
then we know we have to be developing

413
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
things like quantum entanglement and

414
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,639
quantum memory

415
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,240
there are early field trials coming out

416
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
in many locations in particular the

417
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,799
netherlands in 2021

418
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,240
and eventually as quantum computers

419
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,918
start to connect

420
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
to the quantum internet so there's

421
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,400
really a a

422
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,320
large increase in functionality that

423
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,720
physicists engineers need to provide

424
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,320
before we get up to this stage but once

425
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
we get up to this stage just as quantum

426
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,520
computers start to arrive we start to

427
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,880
gain access to things like blind quantum

428
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,400
computing in the cloud

429
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,280
which will be a big application that's

430
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,600
where you can do processing

431
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,039
quantum processing in particular without

432
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,719
the actual quantum computer

433
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,200
knowing what it is you're trying to

434
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,840
process all right but there's a bit of a

435
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,240
gap

436
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,280
here as you can see which means we're

437
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,280
kind of ready to roll out these things

438
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,039
but it's going to be some time before we

439
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,760
hit up to more general purpose quantum

440
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
internet

441
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,840
and so what we imagine is going to be

442
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
happening is there's going to be two

443
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,320
kind of distinct but similar types of

444
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
quantum internets that are developed the

445
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,879
first one is quantum key distribution

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,039
networks

447
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,559
which has end-to-end distribution of

448
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,480
conventional crypto keys

449
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,960
by a quantum key distribution there is

450
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,120
some limited distance

451
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
limited quantum distance and thus we

452
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,840
need trusted nodes to forward

453
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,000
information along

454
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,199
but we can largely do this with today's

455
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,280
technology

456
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,480
and then later and how much later is

457
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,000
definitely an open question right now

458
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
there's going to be this

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
second the quantum information network

460
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
with end-to-end distribution of

461
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,039
entanglement for things like

462
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
conventional crypto keys

463
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,400
but also running these algorithms on

464
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,919
quantum computers

465
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,559
when we get there when we have quantum

466
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,840
repeaters we'll be at unlimited distance

467
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,559
and or but right now we're still at very

468
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,918
early

469
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,280
field trials quantum networks are

470
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,360
emerging worldwide

471
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,720
to what extent this is uh everyone is

472
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,320
aware of this i don't know as i said

473
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
there are commercial boxes available

474
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,559
from companies in switzerland south

475
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,720
korea

476
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,678
china and the uk you can buy these

477
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,559
things

478
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,400
um they generally work up to 100

479
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,158
kilometers maximum and thus they need

480
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,039
again these trusted nodes

481
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,360
china is has launched their qkd trusted

482
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,280
satellite it also distributes

483
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
entanglement at very low rates and

484
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,000
they've been building this 2000

485
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,000
kilometer

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,440
network using multi-hop trustynos that's

487
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,440
going from shanghai down here

488
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
up to beijing it looks like a very nice

489
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,480
online but it's actually composed of

490
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,678
many

491
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
individual trusted node hops along the

492
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,559
way

493
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
yeah there are companies in the united

494
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,600
states like quantum exchange

495
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,039
also building 20 20 mile i always want

496
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,760
to say kilometers there

497
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,400
20 mile long links between new york new

498
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,320
jersey

499
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,559
and in europe we have organizations like

500
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,039
the quantum internet alliance or kia

501
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,678
there's the open qkd consortium building

502
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,280
test bed networks in various locations

503
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,880
around europe and also in europe there's

504
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,639
there's the quantum communication

505
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
infrastructure initiative or sometimes

506
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
virtuous euro qci

507
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
a lot of people involved there so people

508
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
are building um

509
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,240
i heard roy check talk about how there

510
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
will there's a use case document so i

511
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,440
guess

512
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
uh people are aware of the kind of

513
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,720
applications that we're talking about

514
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,080
usually along the lines of secure data

515
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,039
connection between two buildings

516
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,799
at q-tech we are this is our plans for

517
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,679
the next about three years the little

518
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,360
quantum internet

519
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
that we're going to be laying down we're

520
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,639
right now working on the dolph to the

521
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,080
hague link where some of the hardware

522
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
should be rolling out

523
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,559
um onto this link later this month

524
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,480
or or in december and just

525
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,158
to say so qtec itself is a

526
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
mission-driven institute

527
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,120
and our mission is to develop scalable

528
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,640
prototypes of quantum internet with

529
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,879
local quantum processors

530
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,400
enable quantum communication so we're

531
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,200
more than just a research institute and

532
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,760
that's why

533
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,960
we are specifically tasked with building

534
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,960
uh setups like this

535
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,799
we it's always nice to say something

536
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,360
about your home institute this is

537
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,360
actually

538
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,520
the campus of tu delft this was our very

539
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
first let's say quantum internet

540
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,960
deployment where we had

541
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
one user or node over here in the qtec

542
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
buildings

543
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
and one user node i think this is about

544
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,440
800

545
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
meters away if i remember correctly down

546
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,000
in uh down in another building

547
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,600
and a central node provider over here in

548
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,080
engineering

549
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,959
this was used for the first time ever

550
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,600
demonstrating

551
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,000
entanglement in an irrefutably proven

552
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
way

553
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,200
no loopholes or anything like this you

554
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,320
can read

555
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
about this in the 2015 paper

556
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,080
yeah and this is what we're working on

557
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
right now so that's the

558
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,480
the hague to delft link we're going to

559
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
have a central provider

560
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
over here in another town it's called

561
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,120
ricevike this is done

562
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,039
in conjunction with kpn like i said we

563
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,479
should be deploying hardware in 2020.

564
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,080
just to give you an idea this is what

565
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,640
the hardware that's going into the

566
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,360
n nodes here in delft and in the hague

567
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
look like

568
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,240
they are 19-inch um rack mounted boxes

569
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,760
boxes all made by qtec and inside is a

570
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
combination of our own

571
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
off-the-shelf objects and our own custom

572
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,280
electronics and software

573
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,799
and then later in 2020 probably near the

574
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,600
end of 2021

575
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,480
sorry later in 2021 uh these end nodes

576
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,559
are going to be

577
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,679
upgraded to some quantum computer

578
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,200
prototypes

579
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,000
yeah good so i told you a little bit

580
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,520
about qtec

581
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,200
i was then asked about mdi qkd in

582
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,720
particular so i want to spend a little

583
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,240
bit of time in saying just some

584
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,000
general things about quantum key

585
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,280
distribution boxes what they look like

586
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
and what they do

587
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,240
before i tell you about mdi qkd and

588
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,760
hopefully uh convince you that it's a

589
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,039
good protocol to consider and then if

590
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
there's still time i say

591
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,158
a little bit about quantum heat

592
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,200
resolution networks what might they

593
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:48,240
look like what might they do

594
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,320
so qkd in a nutshell qkd

595
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,840
it will involve say something like

596
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,960
transmitting devices and receiving

597
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,439
devices

598
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,720
to transmit and receive optical qubits

599
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
over standard fiber

600
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,159
this is going to happen these qubits

601
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,919
will be detected immediately at some

602
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
kind of receiving station to create

603
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,039
quantum data

604
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,000
and this quantum data can be processed

605
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,360
post-processed into cryptographic keys

606
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,200
and the key thing is that any

607
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,918
eavesdropping on the qubits or on the

608
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
signals

609
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,000
on that optical fiber network the hubits

610
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,720
travel over will be detectable

611
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,960
by the qkd qkd devices

612
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,320
and then this qkd can be used by things

613
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,520
like classical symmetric

614
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,320
encryptors and decryptors for secure

615
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,679
data communication can also be used by

616
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,840
in other things

617
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,520
like authenticating documents or

618
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,879
authenticating messages

619
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,720
in general yeah but what's in the box

620
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,000
so there's more than just sending qubits

621
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,000
of course we will

622
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,159
all our boxes will have a cubit channel

623
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,760
so boxes that send out qubits into the

624
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,000
network to be received

625
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,720
but these qubit channels perform best on

626
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
dark fiber so they only operate up to

627
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,000
some

628
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,600
distance limit or or loss limit let's

629
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,799
say 20 to 30 dbs

630
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:10,158
typically and while we can

631
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,240
make them coexisting with say wdm

632
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,520
channels or conventional signals any of

633
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,159
these signals will decrease the

634
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,760
performance and the operational distance

635
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,320
of our of our qkd boxes

636
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,840
we in general will also need a quantum

637
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,840
control channel for some

638
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,439
let's say quantum physics control of

639
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,240
certain hardware elements there are

640
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,480
things like

641
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
lasers inside of these boxes that need

642
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,640
to be

643
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,080
frequency locked or stabilized there are

644
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
well that's the most important one let's

645
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,720
say

646
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,520
and so we will need something like our

647
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,679
own

648
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,960
quantum control plane for exchanging

649
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,320
data and again

650
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,720
we can mix this wdm with the qubits

651
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
that will decrease performance so it is

652
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
generally better if it runs on its own

653
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,600
fiber

654
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
and of course we also generally use a

655
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,000
conventional control plane or

656
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,520
conventional control

657
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
channel for things like enabling the

658
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,480
network delivering service across

659
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,158
messages etc etc and again wdm is fine

660
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,600
wdming that with the quantum control

661
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
channel is fine

662
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,199
so we can mix these together without

663
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,039
problems

664
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,640
but it's generally good to keep the cuba

665
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,640
channel separate

666
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,799
trusted nodes i'll just say so trusted

667
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,480
nodes

668
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,879
we need these because of this 20 to 30

669
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,880
db

670
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,159
limit the way we get around that for

671
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,480
people that want to service

672
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,120
over 20 over more than 20 to 30 dbs

673
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,039
is by essentially having an intermediate

674
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,399
what we call trusted node

675
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,320
which receives qubits translates that to

676
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,559
just classical data

677
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,158
and then translates that back to qubits

678
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,520
which sends over

679
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,600
an optical fiber again to another

680
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
receiving device and what that means is

681
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,279
that if you are using this

682
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,360
trusted nodes for things like qkb

683
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,400
or the exchange of cryptographic key

684
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,039
what that means is that your

685
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,000
cryptographic key is visible

686
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,879
for some time at this interface at that

687
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,720
trusted node

688
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,919
and so if you have many of these trusted

689
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,279
nodes well you need to trust every

690
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,200
single one along the path

691
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,559
and this could be a problem but at the

692
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
moment that's the best we have for

693
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,520
solving this distance

694
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,399
limitation another

695
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,000
or the first let's say big question that

696
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,760
many of us in the field have been asking

697
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
is what exactly is the service we should

698
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,640
try offering with

699
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,799
qkd boxes there are a few things that

700
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,559
we often talk about one is the idea of

701
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,799
just offering people pure

702
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,240
quantum hardware boxes so we supply

703
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,200
basically only

704
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,480
transmitting boxes receiving boxes and

705
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,720
we say

706
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,600
we can provide quantum secure keys via

707
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,120
our boxes but

708
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,320
you're responsible for whatever you do

709
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,879
with the keys all the security

710
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,678
hardware the security software around

711
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,760
the boxes

712
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,320
you're responsible for the fiber this is

713
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,520
one way we could go

714
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
there are talks about um interfacing

715
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,679
with particular

716
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,440
software and hardware security providers

717
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,840
so that we provide the actual

718
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
application hardware as well so we

719
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,639
provide

720
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,240
the encryption we supply our quantum

721
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,720
boxes and also things like

722
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,799
encryptors but still say okay user

723
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,080
you're responsible for the boxes

724
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,960
you own the boxes you're responsible for

725
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,960
the network

726
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,679
you run the network but look we supply

727
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,760
all the hardware and there's also talks

728
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,440
with various organizations about maybe

729
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,158
the best way forward is we actually

730
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
offer

731
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,159
managed services or something operate

732
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,159
something like an msp

733
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,919
and we provide the entire secure

734
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,159
communication network

735
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,039
we supply the fiber the physical network

736
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,520
and we simply connect to users

737
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,120
who request particular services of us

738
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,158
and then we accept their data and send

739
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,918
it across our network

740
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,200
so this is an open question if you have

741
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,480
thoughts on that

742
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,720
also love to hear them we have

743
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,159
aside for this there are some other open

744
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,760
questions that we

745
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,600
generally have in the field as well like

746
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,200
what kind of quantum secret key rates

747
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,199
will be expected of us

748
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,760
i know this depends very much on the use

749
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,440
case and what services are requested but

750
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,200
at times even ballpark or order of

751
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,520
magnitude estimates would be helpful for

752
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
us going forward we also generally don't

753
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,799
know

754
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,000
what quantum service quality of service

755
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,120
agreements should look like

756
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
in the quantum domain

757
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,080
slas we've had talks with organizations

758
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
over what sla should look like for

759
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,639
quantum in terms of things like priority

760
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,799
key lengths availability security

761
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,200
parameters comes up in quantum as well

762
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,879
what kind of certified security

763
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,080
parameter we should have and also

764
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,039
i think what's interesting is that all

765
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,120
of this is likely to be pairwise defined

766
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,080
these are open questions and then also

767
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,399
generally what

768
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,520
what security level are we aiming for

769
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,439
business confidential

770
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,639
government confidential government

771
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,559
secret even

772
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,320
and this has important implications on

773
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,918
how we as a community

774
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,158
go forward with uh with building the

775
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
hardware because obviously if we are

776
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,880
aiming for government secret

777
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,080
levels um that imposes a lot more

778
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
constraints on the hardware

779
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,279
for instance than say business

780
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,639
confidential

781
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,159
okay good so that's a bit about quantum

782
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,000
key distribution boxes

783
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,919
and a bit of the open questions that we

784
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,520
have let me tell you now

785
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,080
about mdi qkd so there are

786
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,320
lots of different protocols for qkd i'm

787
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,918
sh you've probably heard of bb-84

788
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,240
bbm 92 there's many others gg02 cal

789
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,440
dps and there are many ways to compare

790
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,520
them

791
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,480
technological readiness level typical

792
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,120
key rates

793
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,320
maximum distance the security proof

794
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,959
because they're not all

795
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,200
fully proved at least in terms of

796
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,960
quantum security

797
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,640
whether or not they can be easily

798
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,159
upgraded to quantum internet

799
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,000
networks in the future and how

800
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,080
susceptible their their hardware

801
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
is uh to attacks for instance these are

802
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,519
all things to consider

803
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,840
in general most qkd protocols are

804
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,120
point to point which means if you have a

805
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,799
lot of users

806
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,239
let's say in this case four users that

807
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,240
want to communicate to each other

808
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
they need either dedicated

809
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,120
point-to-point links

810
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,120
something like this they all need

811
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,918
transceiving hardware sorry sending

812
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,719
hardware

813
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,440
and receiving hardware or they require

814
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,600
something like

815
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,039
a trusted node or at least some node in

816
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,678
the middle that can reroute signals

817
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,919
around

818
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,640
something like this there are a few

819
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,360
protocols an mdiqd

820
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,480
that get around this issue mdiq pity

821
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,519
stands for

822
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,039
measurement device independent

823
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,279
quantum key distribution and you'll see

824
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,399
why we call it measurement device

825
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,519
independent in a little bit but the idea

826
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,559
behind it

827
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,399
is that you have one central node all

828
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,519
your users connect to this

829
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,320
it is a way to go point to multipoint

830
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,919
it is a way as we'll see in a second to

831
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,960
more easily upgrade to quantum

832
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,799
information networks

833
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,120
and along with entanglement based and

834
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:02,158
vbm92

835
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,479
it also gets around a lot of the

836
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,240
susceptibilities to attacks on hardware

837
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,919
they're just completely eliminated

838
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,440
yeah so mdiq kitty we generally say

839
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,880
you've been arguing this is a bit more

840
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
practical because it's inherently

841
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,519
networked into things like star networks

842
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,399
users only need a fiber link to the

843
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,120
central node

844
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,600
any pair of users can then create secret

845
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
key

846
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,600
so it's immediately point to multi-point

847
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,479
with minimal fibers

848
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,080
it's also more cost effective so the

849
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,519
users can be added anytime they want

850
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,000
just by adding a single connection which

851
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,279
is good

852
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,159
and also at least at qtek we design all

853
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,559
the hardware

854
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,480
so that all the expensive hardware sits

855
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,639
at the central node so there is one

856
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,200
major hardware investment to build a

857
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,320
central node to kick off your network

858
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,240
but then there's only inexpensive stuff

859
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,000
that lies around at all the users so

860
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,600
adding in more and more users is much

861
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,039
much less costly and at like i said

862
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,519
upgradable feature i'm going to get to

863
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,200
that but it's also more secure and the

864
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,240
reason for that is this central node

865
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,600
is not a trusted node the central node

866
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,559
never has access to the key it never has

867
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,399
access to any

868
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,799
sensitive information and this is not

869
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,399
just by hardware design this is by

870
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,519
design of the physical

871
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,399
protocol itself in fact if the central

872
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,799
node

873
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,559
attempts in any way to gain access to

874
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,320
the key

875
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,080
that will appear like any other

876
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,559
eavesdropper sitting on the fiber and

877
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,480
the users will immediately know this

878
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:35,039
which means they don't in principle have

879
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,960
to trust the central node

880
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,399
and the best that can be done even if

881
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,919
you give that central note over to an

882
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,879
attacker the best that can be done is

883
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,320
denial of service attack

884
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,039
the endpoints themselves they are only

885
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,879
send only units and not vulnerable to

886
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,760
receiver attacks

887
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
and that is a very key thing because so

888
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,760
this is a particular table

889
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,080
that comes from the etsy white paper

890
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,320
from 2018 on implementation

891
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,879
security of quantum cryptography so

892
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,279
inside this etsy white paper

893
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,720
they listed a large number of security

894
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,480
issues

895
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,319
against quantum cryptography systems

896
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
against qkd systems

897
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,000
trojan horse attacks multi-photon

898
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
emission et cetera et cetera

899
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,679
the first let's say block of these and

900
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,879
it's about the first four of these

901
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,839
are against the senders and all of these

902
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,159
can be avoided

903
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,000
by what's called privacy amplification

904
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,520
so pa privacy amplification

905
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,239
pa pa pa

906
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,119
the next block of these are all against

907
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,479
receivers

908
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,040
the detectors and there it is much more

909
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,679
tricky

910
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:43,199
so there the techniques to protect

911
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,720
ourselves against these attacks involve

912
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,719
things like active monitoring

913
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,839
like detector symmetrization

914
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,599
the problem with active monitoring of

915
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,679
course is that well what happens if

916
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,200
someone attacks your active monitoring

917
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,720
what happens if someone hacks into your

918
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,839
active monitoring or takes control of

919
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
your active monitoring

920
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,000
then this is no longer a good security

921
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,480
measure what is explicitly listed

922
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,040
throughout the document is look

923
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:11,280
mdiqd mdiq kitty mdiqt

924
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,320
is intrinsically a way to protect

925
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,280
yourself against

926
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,480
a large number of these attacks so we

927
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,240
always say mdiqd is more secure

928
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,079
for this reason and the other point is

929
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,799
this upgrade ability

930
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,400
so i'm not to what extent everyone is

931
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,040
aware of this i don't know but in

932
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,560
general

933
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,279
for quantum internet almost every

934
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,240
architecture at the hardware level for

935
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,000
quantum internet

936
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,240
has things called quantum repeaters

937
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,359
say at two locations and these quantum

938
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
repeaters

939
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,040
about halfway between them actually very

940
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,400
close to halfway between them is a

941
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,759
midpoint station

942
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
that does some kind of bell state

943
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,839
measurement so this entire block

944
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,760
is essentially what functions as your

945
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,200
quantum repeater you need two users or

946
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,760
repeaters with quantum memories and your

947
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,480
midpoint station

948
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,920
and the key thing is that this midpoint

949
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,680
station

950
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,000
is identical to what we use in mdi qkd

951
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,359
this is intentional we've because qtec

952
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
is looking long

953
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,960
forwards into the future we are

954
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,960
designing our midpoint station our

955
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,200
central node for mdi q3d

956
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,680
to be identical to the midpoint station

957
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,919
needed for quantum repeaters

958
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,000
which means that if you put let's say

959
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
you build exactly this set up here

960
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,119
in a star with your central node or

961
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,960
midpoint station

962
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,200
these users can be upgraded in the

963
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,640
future just by adding in quantum memory

964
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,799
and a little bit of extra control

965
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,560
hardware and software can be upgraded to

966
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,920
quantum repeaters

967
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,680
and that's exactly what we're going to

968
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,560
be doing in

969
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,440
the dutch quantum network in 2021 after

970
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,000
we build

971
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,200
after we build this section with mdiqd

972
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,839
we will be

973
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,319
throwing in some quantum memories uh to

974
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,680
upgrade it to quantum repeaters

975
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,480
yeah so what i also like to say and

976
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,000
argue a lot

977
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,400
is that it is important especially

978
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,160
given how much money is likely to be

979
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,839
needed to build the quantum internet it

980
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,720
is important that we consider the longer

981
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,320
end goal

982
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,759
that we want full quantum internet with

983
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,960
entanglement distribution

984
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,599
and we consider how we build even qkd

985
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,280
networks

986
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,720
now such that we can easily upgrade them

987
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,640
in the future

988
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,160
to entanglement distribution quantum

989
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,000
information networks

990
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,759
we know things like we know midpoint

991
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,400
stations are going to be needed

992
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,119
this is almost almost a certainty and we

993
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,160
know that

994
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,400
um we know from simulations

995
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,000
from from analytic work that asymmetric

996
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
link so if this midpoint station

997
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,839
is closer to one side than the other

998
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,760
that already degrades performance uh

999
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,520
quite quickly as this starts to become

1000
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,440
asymmetric so laying down qkd networks

1001
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,000
midpoint stations and symmetric links

1002
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,359
will do a lot uh going forward

1003
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,480
into the future good okay

1004
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,920
um i'm going to skip over all these nice

1005
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,440
this last section with all these nice

1006
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,119
graphs but i just wanted to say there

1007
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,680
are some other open questions which

1008
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,040
maybe

1009
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,919
would be interesting to people in the

1010
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,440
room like whether or not

1011
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,119
we should i said at the start that

1012
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,640
all our quantum internet systems and

1013
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,839
quantum cryptography systems work better

1014
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,520
over dark fiber

1015
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,799
but whether we should immediately be

1016
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,000
thinking about wdm multiplexing

1017
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,839
we don't know which is the right

1018
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,440
direction to go should we optimize fiber

1019
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,880
use essentially with multiplexing or

1020
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,560
optimize the quantum performance we

1021
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
don't know

1022
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,320
point to point is point to point

1023
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,240
sufficient say in the short to medium

1024
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
term or should we go point to multipoint

1025
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,680
very quickly with the early

1026
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,440
networks these test beds that are being

1027
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,560
built around europe

1028
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,680
it's a question there to what extent are

1029
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,839
trusted nodes allowed

1030
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,839
they're certainly going to be required

1031
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,200
in some situations if anyone says

1032
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,880
we want a huge network spanning 800

1033
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,839
kilometers well we know we need trusted

1034
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,880
nodes with

1035
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,560
but if your network is only to span 100

1036
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,599
kilometers 200 kilometers

1037
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,040
or should we avoid trusted nodes

1038
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,320
anyway it's likely that users and

1039
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,079
governments will decide this but this

1040
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
certainly plays a role on how we build

1041
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,359
because protection measures are going to

1042
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,400
be needed everywhere

1043
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,799
we have questions we talk about um

1044
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,680
questions in terms of enrollment how do

1045
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,000
we get

1046
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,680
more people into an existing quantum

1047
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,359
network we want to avoid things like

1048
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,078
vendor lock-in so i guess we need some

1049
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,279
standards

1050
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,040
at some point should we allow anyone to

1051
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,240
connect there's going to be exchanges at

1052
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,480
some point

1053
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,000
ixes but in the quantum domain should we

1054
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,359
allow anyone to connect to them how

1055
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,599
should we deal with

1056
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,839
say networks that connect to these

1057
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,119
exchanges that start acting suspicious

1058
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,440
and what do we do about lawful

1059
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,079
interception there's a real question

1060
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,680
there

1061
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:46,320
if we're going to say that we're

1062
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,040
offering um

1063
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,880
a secure network an unconditionally

1064
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,040
secure network with unbreakable

1065
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,280
communication what happens when we

1066
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,279
actually have to break it

1067
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,320
we don't know these are open questions

1068
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,880
though

1069
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,599
good so just a couple takeaways the

1070
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
quantum

1071
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,040
internet it's going to start with

1072
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,640
quantum key distribution for now

1073
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,400
and full quantum internet will come

1074
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,440
later this will take time

1075
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
i think it is likely to be 15 to 20

1076
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,520
years

1077
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
probably people have been saying that

1078
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,160
forever but 15 to 20 years until we

1079
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,599
really get to

1080
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,879
to full quantum internet our qtex

1081
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,200
the dutch quantum network we are

1082
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,160
starting up next month and upgrading to

1083
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,078
repeaters early

1084
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,960
next year we will have a test bed there

1085
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,640
will be we have a project called quantum

1086
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,240
q e quantum network experience where

1087
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,680
people can log in and use the network

1088
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,118
that will come online at some point as

1089
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,680
well

1090
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,960
there are many open questions that as

1091
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,720
physicists we just don't know how to

1092
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,400
deal with like what service to offer

1093
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,078
wdms trust in those

1094
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,920
network management for instance there

1095
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:50,079
are many qkd protocols

1096
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,440
i will say again at qtec we like mdi qkd

1097
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,119
because of its better security

1098
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,720
it's upgradability and we believe cost

1099
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,640
scaling

1100
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,799
and i strongly believe we should be

1101
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,078
designing the physical topology for

1102
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,160
these networks now

1103
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,760
so that we can easily roll out cue

1104
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,759
quantum information networks

1105
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,880
when they come about right if you want

1106
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,599
more information

1107
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,680
uh this paper here in science from 2018

1108
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:12,880
this laid out the the qtec roadmap for

1109
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,160
quantum internet

1110
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,599
feel free to check out that out that

1111
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,560
goes into much more detail some of the

1112
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:19,599
things i said

1113
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,599
and also if you like listening to me

1114
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,599
you can google me on youtube joshua

1115
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,240
slater qripped i think i have a 90

1116
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
minute talk on more details of mdiq pity

1117
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,160
when i was younger and more younger and

1118
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,760
less secure let's say

1119
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,279
but yes so that's there as well if you

1120
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,800
want more details

1121
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
anyway thank you very much for listening

1122
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,599
great thanks josh uh great talk so

1123
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,599
uh questions

1124
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,359
i actually see something on jabber from

1125
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,560
bruno

1126
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,598
uh why do we need

1127
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,200
qkd or pkc to replace classical

1128
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,040
public key infrastructure in the first

1129
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,078
place

1130
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,000
yeah something about that yep yep i

1131
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,800
normally have some slides about uh about

1132
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,240
this but the

1133
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:14,960
the the issue is that the issue is that

1134
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,200
when quantum computers come about there

1135
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,280
is this shores algorithm which will

1136
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,399
allow

1137
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,200
breaking a number of algorithms that are

1138
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
used

1139
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,879
in conventional cryptography

1140
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,319
not the symmetric encryption algorithms

1141
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,240
but the asymmetric

1142
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,960
algorithms that are used for key

1143
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,118
distribution and key encapsulation

1144
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,079
and so the problem becomes when these

1145
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,280
quantum computers are about

1146
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,960
if rogue governments or rogue agencies

1147
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
people we don't trust have access to

1148
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,319
them

1149
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,280
if they can they will be able to break

1150
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:52,560
the existing the current today public

1151
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,280
key infrastructure we use for key

1152
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
distribution

1153
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,520
which essentially means they'll control

1154
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,800
the communication network honestly

1155
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,560
i've heard that from other people as

1156
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,599
well in security

1157
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,160
and so we need some better techniques to

1158
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,319
protect

1159
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,440
that quantum that key distribution and

1160
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:13,040
one way to do that

1161
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:16,480
is quantum key distribution

1162
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,920
right uh we'll have time for one

1163
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,920
question somebody has one

1164
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,720
i always have questions if nobody else

1165
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,319
does

1166
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,118
go ahead rod actually this is actually a

1167
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,960
fairly low level simple one um how long

1168
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,480
are the links you're actually installing

1169
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,440
i gather that um one of the links on

1170
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,359
your four

1171
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,440
node ring that you drew in the

1172
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,960
netherlands is actually pretty long for

1173
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,960
for the current uh technology

1174
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,599
yep uh you're talking about going back

1175
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,720
to

1176
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:58,319
this one yeah um yeah

1177
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,279
so this link here so okay so we actually

1178
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,720
don't have the

1179
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,560
uh the fibers yet for any of the links

1180
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,279
other than the first one

1181
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,640
so the the distance that this will be or

1182
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,760
the loss that this will be

1183
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,799
we don't know at the moment but at least

1184
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:16,640
this first link

1185
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,000
uh dolph to the hag so this covers um

1186
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,720
20 db so it's

1187
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,359
i mean yeah i say 20 db because of

1188
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,200
course uh

1189
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,359
fiber that's in the ground is never a

1190
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,118
straight line

1191
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,040
and uh of course there are many uh

1192
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,880
connection points along the way

1193
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,240
uh that add in extra loss so we at least

1194
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,680
know that this link is

1195
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,118
is 20 db yeah our expectation is this

1196
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,200
one will also be 20 db

1197
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,480
and then these ones will more likely be

1198
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,359
longer more loss

1199
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,359
yes but we'll see

1200
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,440
thanks yup okay great

1201
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,799
uh so thanks josh uh but whilst we

1202
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,280
switch over to

1203
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,319
the next uh say which is chong gang with

1204
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,480
his slides

1205
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,440
uh if anybody has a question whilst we

1206
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,520
switch over

1207
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,280
uh feel free to ask it

1208
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,280
i'll stop your screen share josh

1209
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,200
okay uh thanks josh uh

1210
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,720
hope everybody found that interesting oh

1211
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,399
i have something from

1212
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,319
joey salazar would you like to

1213
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:33,839
unbeat yourself i think you have to do

1214
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:33,839
it yourself

1215
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:47,839
i can't hear you joey

1216
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,200
uh

1217
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,800
uh josh john joyce says he'll uh put it

1218
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,800
here on the chat

1219
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,480
okay there was also another question in

1220
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,920
the in the chat in the chat from

1221
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,160
showtime he said

1222
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,359
josh did you say that the qkd networks

1223
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,839
have e to e

1224
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,839
end to end conventional keys

1225
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,960
i'm not sure if that's i'm not sure if

1226
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:23,118
he's asking about the authentication

1227
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:26,240
of the the nodes or

1228
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,359
uh so the the qkd

1229
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,598
networks can provide

1230
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,598
end-to-end conventional keys

1231
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,839
okay so uh it's not it provides

1232
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,759
end-to-end

1233
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,240
keys to the end nodes but but does not

1234
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,640
have e to e confidentiality or it does

1235
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,919
have

1236
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:51,040
and and confidentiality

1237
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,400
okay i think that's but

1238
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,240
that might be a discussion because i'm

1239
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:58,880
not exactly sure how

1240
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,959
short is defining confidentiality here i

1241
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,240
mean certainly there will be

1242
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,960
it is known that it would be easy to see

1243
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,359
where the

1244
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,520
traffic is coming from at any given

1245
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:13,759
point so you would know

1246
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,759
uh yeah i mean you would know who is

1247
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,040
distributing keys with who

1248
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,680
this could be figured out just by

1249
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:23,680
monitoring classical traffic

1250
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:26,399
but the key itself would not be known

1251
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,919
to intermediate nodes at least in the

1252
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,319
case of mdi qkd

1253
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,079
and entanglement based and and other

1254
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,880
protocols like this

1255
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:38,720
but yes okay so the uh your midpoint uh

1256
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,720
bell state analyzer node there

1257
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,760
does not have to be trusted but you get

1258
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,240
secure end-to-end keys across across

1259
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,680
that

1260
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,439
right yes but and then okay so

1261
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,440
hallman baker just said there's traffic

1262
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,559
analysis attack and i completely agree

1263
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,200
you would know you would know which

1264
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,599
users

1265
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,279
are at which times trying to generate

1266
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,160
key with each other

1267
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,960
that said the keys would then be

1268
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,558
storable

1269
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,200
for instance and you don't you wouldn't

1270
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,079
know from that point when these keys are

1271
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,359
getting used

1272
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,880
in principle okay

1273
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,558
um white check i think we need to move

1274
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,280
on we're already running a little over

1275
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,599
time

1276
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,359
uh that's fine if we run a bit over time

1277
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,559
we do actually have a bit of

1278
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:24,400
leeway this time uh so

1279
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,079
we won't have to cut anything short okay

1280
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,520
thanks thanks josh again uh there's a

1281
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,960
question you can answer in the chat

1282
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,400
uh of from joey but in the meantime

1283
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,839
we'll switch over to

status and also the recent updates uh

1296
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,559
to our uh applications and the use cases

1297
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,680
for

1298
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,760
quantum intellect uh document um

1299
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,799
so major uh basically want to share with

1300

1306
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,839
video

1307

yeah thanks so kind of just a

1312
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,160
recap um the uh little background about

1313
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,759
the

1314
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
current version uh o3 so basically back

1315
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,599
in

1316
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:13,040
may um this document has been

1317
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,000
accepted as a research document um

1318
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,119
and then in july um iutv meeting last

1319
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,160
meeting

1320
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,839
we presented the version zero one

1321
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,118
uh and then received quite a few

1322
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,759
good comments and feedback and after

1323
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,880
that

1324
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:32,559
uh we generate the version learner 2 to

1325
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,240
address those comments

1326
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:39,119
we received from ietf108

1327
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,680
and also this version 0.2 has been

1328
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,920
shared through the email reflector and

1329
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,359
also received some comments especially

1330
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,960
comments from patrick

1331
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:52,000
now ojic or logitech um

1332
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:54,400
so the current version 03 and

1333
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,640
it's kind of if we compare to the

1334
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,280
version zero one we have

1335
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:01,520
uh presented in us ietv meeting and

1336
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,359
under the next slide that will show you

1337
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,559
what's the major updates uh we did

1338
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:11,598
after last ietf meeting

1339
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,400
so we kind of reorganized the six and

1340
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,480
six

1341
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,839
which is uh above the general

1342
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,800
requirements

1343
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,720
we split this section into two subpar

1344
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,760
subpar uh two parts

1345
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:27,200
uh 6.1 is a background and

1346
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,599
6.2 is the requirements uh

1347
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,720
in addition to that um based on the

1348
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,520
feedback

1349
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,799
from last meeting we ended a new

1350
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
paragraph

1351
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,079
about the management related

1352
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,200
requirements um

1353
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,400
as a part of this 6.2 trying to see

1354
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,879
uh from the um if we have the quantum

1355
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,319
internet in future we need to manage and

1356
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,359
correlate uh the quantum resources

1357
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,839
um either for a quantum node

1358
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:57,440
or for the whole quantum intellect and

1359
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,920
the quantum resource could be the

1360
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:03,200
quantum memory and the quantum code bits

1361
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,480
and also could be the quantum collection

1362
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:09,520
being established among two um

1363
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,559
quantum notes uh that's the part

1364
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,000
we added for from management perspective

1365
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,559
there is a requirement and then we

1366
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,520
and also based on the feedback from last

1367
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,960
meeting

1368
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,000
uh we added the two paragraphs in

1369
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,040
section nine secured consideration

1370
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,119
basically to discuss privacy related

1371
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:36,000
and issues uh although

1372
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,559
one of our use cases applications is

1373
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,599
about

1374
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:43,119
the privacy preservation like the blind

1375
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,359
quantum computing uh some terminology

1376
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,240
we also kind of based on the email

1377
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,078
discussion

1378
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,640
um in order to avoid any confusion and

1379
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,000
make the

1380
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,480
terminology more um consistent with the

1381
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,680
principle documents

1382
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,440
we replace the quantum sub network

1383
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,520
with a quantum network just called

1384
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,559
quantum network

1385
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,559
again here are some editorial changes

1386
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:12,160
throughout the whole document

1387
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:15,599
just to increase readability

1388
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,200
i didn't put it over here in the slides

1389
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,440
i saw that we already have discussed in

1390
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,919
an email but overall these three types

1391
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,960
of

1392
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,079
application or use cases are being

1393
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,640
described in this documentation uh one

1394
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,880
is uh

1395
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,680
based on the code kd we describe the uh

1396
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,160
see the

1397
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,598
secure communications based on quantum k

1398
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,078
distribution

1399
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:36,800
uh the second application we call the

1400
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,880
blinds

1401
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,960
quantum computing the third one is the

1402
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,559
distributed quantum computing

1403
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,400
and that's kind of three um applications

1404
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:52,319
being um included in stockmans

1405
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,800
uh so uh next step um this slides kind

1406
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:56,079
of

1407
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,599
uh i pull put a goodreads slides um like

1408
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,720
before the last friday

1409
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,400
and after that i received some very

1410
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,439
very good feedback comments from

1411
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,640
logitech so i i think the next step

1412
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,040
is going to um

1413
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,078
address the comments from audiotech and

1414
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,079
also

1415
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,000
uh if there are some uh furthermore

1416
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,200
comments feedback from the team who

1417
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,839
already here

1418
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,558
uh we would like to uh you know continue

1419
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,520
to uh

1420
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,079
address those uh comments feedback to

1421
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,200
improve

1422
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:28,079
the document furthermore uh that's our

1423
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:32,319
goal

1424
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:34,800
um so i think that's kind of

1425
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,079
uh i don't know if i need to show the um

1426
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,480
content of this uh

1427
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,079
the recent document or not but i would

1428
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,319
like to um

1429
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,000
hear any kind of question or feedback

1430
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,520
from you um

1431
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,520
this is the last slide of my

1432
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,920
presentation

1433
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,280
all right great thanks chuang gang is

1434
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:07,839
are there any questions

1435
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:07,839
from the floor first

1436
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:20,480
uh joseph did you mean to enable your

1437
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:23,200
mic instead of your camera

1438
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,200
joseph here

1439
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,079
okay uh there are no questions at the

1440
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,759
moment i have actually a question so

1441
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,839
i did actually so i wrote that email on

1442
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,400
friday and

1443
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,000
uh i'm i don't know i'm still a bit

1444
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,520
confused about your classification of

1445
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,599
control plane versus data plane

1446
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,759
applications in a quantum context

1447
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:52,319
uh i find the distinction fairly clear

1448
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,000
in when you draw your analogies in the

1449
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:57,839
classical context

1450
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,440
but i'm not entirely clear what

1451
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,520
what what your definition of control

1452
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,200
plane is in the

1453
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,759
quantum context could you actually

1454
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,480
explain that a bit more maybe

1455
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,599
okay sure uh thank you what'd you think

1456
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:17,839
uh

1457
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:17,839
maybe i'll show that table i'm sorry

1458
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:29,200
i think it comes here yes uh

1459
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:32,640
can you see this table um

1460
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:34,160
yes okay thank you so here we're trying

1461
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
to do is uh use

1462
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,319
this of course we have the text

1463
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,200
description uh i saw this table probably

1464
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:43,839
uh maybe easier for us to uh discuss

1465
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,240
uh so here we we have the three columns

1466
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,640
here

1467
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,799
like a classic internet examples in

1468
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,879
terms of control plane data plane

1469
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:52,319
uh and then in middle we have we call

1470
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,040
these standalone

1471
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:56,400
quantum network examples uh those could

1472
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:59,040
be

1473
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,680
when we see standalone quantile network

1474
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,720
basically like

1475
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,118
isolated just one quantum network and

1476
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,279
then

1477
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,480
uh the third column here uh quantum

1478
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,000
intellect uh

1479
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,400
in future if we have the uh you know uh

1480
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,280
the uh the fulcrum internet what will be

1481
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,920
examples

1482
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,960
in terms of control plan and data plan

1483
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,440
applications

1484
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,799
so let's look at the classic intellect

1485
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,040
uh that's very clear i

1486
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:27,440
i i assume uh we have the icmp or dnase

1487
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,880
those kind of application or pro code

1488
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,319
they are used

1489
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,400
uh to you know enable the data plan

1490
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,279
application like a web browsing or email

1491
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,400
whatever

1492
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:39,200
uh so that so basically control plan

1493
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,400
here

1494
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,598
is not for the end user it's for to

1495
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,760
facilitate

1496
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:47,520
the data transfer data transmission

1497
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,160
among end users

1498
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,280
uh and then a standalone quantum network

1499
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:56,000
example here

1500
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,000
so we were trying to use the same um

1501
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,240
not principle same methodology trying to

1502
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,599
see if we look at the

1503
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,479
a single quantum network what will be

1504
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,119
the operations look like the control

1505
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,760
plan

1506
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,559
for classic intellect what would be the

1507
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,240
operations

1508
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,200
for the next equivalent to data plan for

1509
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,959
classic

1510
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:21,919
intellect so here we were saying for the

1511
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,319
one of the major operation for the um

1512
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,040
one single quantum network is kind of we

1513
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:28,000
call the

1514
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,720
entanglement distribution in order to

1515
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,680
establish

1516
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,558
end-to-end quantum collection amount to

1517
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,000
users

1518
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:38,240
that's kind of the the the major purpose

1519
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,520
for the quantum network and then for

1520
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,118
doing that

1521
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:46,480
um we needed some support some signaling

1522
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:49,359
to control the entanglement distribution

1523
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,160
and then we we put over here trying to

1524
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:53,440
say oh

1525
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:57,200
it's kind of similar to the smp

1526
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,839
or dnas like because

1527
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,118
the signaling here it's not for

1528
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,839
themselves is for the

1529
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,920
quantum and for the entire distribution

1530
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:09,040
so from this perspective

1531
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,200
we thought it might be a advanced

1532
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,400
example when we talk about the control

1533
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,319
plan data plan

1534
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,839
but i know there might be something a

1535
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:19,119
little bit different from

1536
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:23,119
like like we do here for the

1537
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:24,640
classic internet um and then

1538
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:26,480
we when we look at the quantum

1539
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,879
interlades and

1540
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,440
this this third economy i think is a

1541
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,680
cinema more clear here is

1542
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,359
no matter what we let's say we have a

1543
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,399
cocaine we have some uh

1544
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:41,200
even if uh the the

1545
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,880
repeater economy repeater based uh qrn

1546
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,118
economy information network

1547
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,000
but the data plan is still like very

1548
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,640
similar to the classic

1549
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,520
internet could be uh like the video

1550
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,319
conference but

1551
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,200
it has a you know better security using

1552
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:55,920
kokidi based

1553
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,879
secure communication setup to allocate

1554
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,359
the quantum case

1555
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,799
for uh let's say just one uh both

1556
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,880
parties for this uh

1557
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:04,400
late conference it's more secure that's

1558
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,119
a data plan application

1559
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,640
uh and then for this uh case in order to

1560
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,200
support this application on the data

1561
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,558
plan

1562
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,160
the control plan will be the cocaine uh

1563
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,079
or or the quantum theme um

1564
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,319
you know in order to uh serve or

1565
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,960
facilitate this kokidi based video

1566
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:24,079
conference

1567
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,160
that's kind of the um

1568
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,640
uh what we were uh thinking about is

1569
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,680
control plan data plan for

1570
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,720
for different types of uh on internet

1571
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,078
classical or

1572
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,680
quantum i don't know if that's clear or

1573
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,160
answer your question would you take

1574
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,160
or uh yeah it does so basically it's now

1575
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,640
that you've explained it it's kind of

1576
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,000
really clear to me now it's just i was

1577
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,359
just really confused for some reason

1578
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,640
from the text so maybe i'll just go

1579
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:51,359
reread the text and

1580
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:52,558
highlight which parts uh confused me but

1581
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,920
actually you do raise an interesting

1582
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:55,040
point here which i i don't think has

1583
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,079
occurred to you before

1584
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,839
maybe just me is that uh when you say

1585
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,119
quantum ping i think you imply that some

1586
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,319
of the quantum traffic

1587
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:06,720
also counts as control plane

1588
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:07,440
is that correct uh yes and also this

1589
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,160
quantum pin

1590
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,799
actually is contributed by the comments

1591
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,720
um

1592
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,000
i remember from patrick or someone uh

1593
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,558
basically trying to i think it's a good

1594
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,760
comment

1595
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:21,119
first of all it's kind of uh used to

1596
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,240
test if a quantum collection has been

1597
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,920
established

1598
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,399
between uh a pair of quantum nodes

1599
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,000
right yeah right yeah because the pin

1600
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,280
for the classical intellect is trying to

1601
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,079
say oh if i can

1602
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,920
reach a ipad address or not i i will

1603
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,440
just escape

1604
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:43,440
yeah yeah

1605
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,119
uh okay no thanks that's clear to me uh

1606
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:52,319
thanks for that are there any other

1607
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:55,119
questions from the floor

1608
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:56,640
something in the chat this question

1609
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,720
might not be completely appropriate but

1610
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,960
i was wondering

1611
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,640
document for guiding the layman rather

1612
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,079
than a quantum expert

1613
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,839
also should the distributed quantum

1614
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,200
computing section include an example of

1615
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:10,480
enhancement gained from

1616
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,480
distributed quantum computing

1617
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,280
uh i don't know if i sorry if i fully

1618
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,599
capture that or not

1619
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,119
could you uh it's in the chat as well

1620
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,440
it's also in the chat if you just move

1621
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:34,559
to the chat window the question okay

1622
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:37,760
might be easier that way okay thank you

1623
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,760
and yeah scroll down

1624
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,919
this one right yeah excuse me

1625
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,839
forgotten

1626
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,399
example of the enhancement getting from

1627
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:06,000
uh the i think this has one

1628
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:09,200
two questions for the first one um

1629
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,799
i i think uh there might be

1630
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,640
uh two um relevant purposes

1631
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:20,319
here one is to um

1632
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:23,520
you know it could be as a good document

1633
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:24,079
for the namers who are interested in

1634
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,680
this

1635
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:30,960
field but they are kind of

1636
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:34,078
are you know kind of challenging

1637
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,559
for them to dive into the details

1638
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,119
immediately and then instead of that

1639
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,160
they can

1640
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:42,799
read over this use case document

1641
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,160
trying to get a high level uh

1642
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,359
information like the app

1643
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:50,799
what what what quantum inter application

1644
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:53,119
will look like i think that

1645
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,559
could this document this document could

1646
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,680
serve that purpose

1647
01:03:54,559 --> 01:04:00,640
uh relevant in addition to that

1648
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,279
is i think even for this coirgy it's

1649
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:04,960
more like

1650
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:08,480
when we do uh like in the printation

1651
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:11,520
from the logitech we have the principal

1652
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:14,160
documents and also there were three

1653
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,038
uh documents being expired but people

1654
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,359
also are

1655
01:04:15,039 --> 01:04:19,039
interested in that i think this use case

1656
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,680
document could be a

1657
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,559
good input and a complimentary document

1658
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,680
for

1659
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:27,680
uh later on when we standardize or we do

1660
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,879
a

1661
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:33,359
detailed document about different

1662
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,400
quantum intellect uh making them like

1663
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,920
the quantum

1664
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,640
collection establishments and so on

1665
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,680
um that's my answer for the first

1666
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,759
question but i think

1667
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,839
probably chairs rod and the logitech

1668
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,319
could have more insights

1669
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,759
uh for this question um the goal of this

1670
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:53,440
use case document

1671
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,240
but that's my my response uh the second

1672
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,000
part

1673
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,520
should really should a distributed

1674
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,240
quantum computing section

1675
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,640
include example of enhancements gained

1676
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,839
from

1677
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,038
distributed con computing i think a

1678
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:08,558
second question if i

1679
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:11,440
understood correctly ask us to

1680
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,720
show some benefits or what we can get

1681
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,599
out of this

1682
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,078
if we use distributed quantum computing

1683
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,520
uh

1684
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:22,160
i think it's a good question i i think

1685
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:23,839
somewhere we put some benefits in the

1686
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:26,240
document described

1687
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,200
uh by using distributed quantum

1688
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,118
computing

1689
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,399
which kind of new features could be

1690
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,119
enabled

1691
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:38,000
by it but i will double check

1692
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:39,839
uh and then anyway we are going to have

1693
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,079
a next version 04

1694
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,200
so i would object and keep in mind uh

1695
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:45,760
this um

1696
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,640
second part yeah i don't know if i

1697
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:50,000
answer your question michelle or not

1698
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,680
i think i just have something to add to

1699
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:54,960
the last part

1700
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,598
uh i think so there are examples in your

1701
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,480
document

1702
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:00,640
uh i think uh it kind of relates to the

1703
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,599
feedback i also wrote on the email

1704
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,000
on friday uh that actually i think with

1705
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,039
a bit more

1706
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,680
detail it might be a bit clearer as well

1707
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,160
okay yeah we'll do that and also for the

1708
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,440
document

1709
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:15,200
it's probably on its own not for the

1710
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,319
limit but in conjunction as chong said

1711
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,598
in conjunction with the principles

1712
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,359
document then

1713
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,079
yeah i think it'll be good for that

1714
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:26,160
should be good for the networking expert

1715
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:26,160
not complete layman to networking

1716
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,839
there's a question on the chat

1717
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,720
from joey salazar if you scroll down a

1718
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,440
bit

1719
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,160
or also from rodney but i don't know

1720
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,280
rodney

1721
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,200
do you did you have your question

1722
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,599
answered or

1723
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,598
not yet

1724
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,720
um yes for the tcp i think

1725
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:54,319
the uh the think packet

1726
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:58,078
i i personally would consider it as a

1727
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:00,000
control plan um but you know tcp

1728
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,880
the safe is a pro co it's very hard to

1729
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,799
say uh it's a control plan pro core

1730
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,039
uh data plan protocol i think i

1731
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,599
underlist that part compared to the

1732
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:10,240
segment or packet from the user i think

1733
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:11,920
that

1734
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:15,279
from that perspective i would like to

1735
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,640
say it's for the control purpose

1736
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:21,280
um yeah okay

1737
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,759
so in conjunction with that i'm not sure

1738
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,359
why

1739
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,720
the third and fourth columns are

1740
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,960
actually separate why is there a

1741
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:29,598
standalone quantum network example

1742
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,440
and a quantum internet example why is

1743
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,039
the distinction of control plane versus

1744
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,520
data plane different for the two types

1745
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,520
of networks

1746
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,640
uh so like these two columns right

1747
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,880
um yeah we could we could merge them

1748
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,480
together here um the original idea here

1749
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,680
is trying to see

1750
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,599
if we have a standalone quantum network

1751
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,558
it's not really starting to support

1752
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:59,920
large scale quantum application yet

1753
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,880
and then what will be the major

1754
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,760
operations

1755
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,280
for this standalone quantum network we

1756
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,359
thought that could help us

1757
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,760
to understand the full operations

1758
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:13,359
uh from a small scale quantum network

1759
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,560
and then we move to the

1760
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:20,238
large scale quantum internet which has

1761
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:23,120
um full-blown uh features to support

1762
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:24,318
like cocaine based or some other quantum

1763
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,399
feature based

1764
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:31,440
applications but we if we

1765
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,519
if you think um it's better to

1766
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,960
have just like classic interlade and

1767
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,480
quantum intellect

1768
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,920
um we could um

1769
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:43,678
merge the third column and the second

1770
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,960
column

1771
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,399
i think for for control plane for actual

1772
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,239
control plane work

1773
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,639
there probably is a substantial amount

1774
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:56,959
of work at the border routers

1775
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:58,880
but for for the use cases document

1776
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,560
i'm not sure that that even the

1777
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,159
existence of a border router

1778
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,880
should actually matter we should be able

1779
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,879
to run these

1780
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,319
applications in theory across the border

1781
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,080
although maybe not all networks will

1782
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,799
support all functionality

1783
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,759
in the early days so i think it's more a

1784
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:16,880
matter of when you

1785
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:19,279
cross a boundary that that changes

1786
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,000
functionality as opposed to just an

1787
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,400
administrative

1788
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,399
border

1789
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:29,199
uh yes i think that's valid

1790
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,120
that's about it from the use case

1791
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:35,439
perspective i think that's about it we

1792
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:38,318
are kind of not to touch uh like the

1793
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,960
uh structure or you the term use a

1794
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,480
borrowed

1795
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:45,600
related or dependent uh so maybe the

1796
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:46,479
the better way is just to maybe for this

1797
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,440
table

1798
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:52,318
just has two column class interlate and

1799
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,318
quantum intellect

1800
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,400
that's my current opinion but i should

1801
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:57,839
probably reread this and think about it

1802
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,960
a little bit more but that's that's my

1803
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,440
current opinion that they should be

1804
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,560
merged

1805
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:05,759
okay um yeah it's now

1806
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:07,360
nine after we have 31 minutes remaining

1807
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,080
i think if i if i'm looking at the

1808
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,480
clock four hours we have two hours for

1809
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,679
the home

1810
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,199
oh we have full two hours we go to the

1811
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,760
top of the hour okay we have plenty of

1812
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,759
time

1813
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:20,400
i was thinking

1814
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:22,800
uh so at the end chongang asked a

1815
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,400
question is whether documents ready for

1816
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,840
group last call i'd say it needs at

1817
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,159
least one iteration

1818
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,880
but obviously open to the rest of the

1819
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,400
group and

1820
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,080
rodney i would agree it needs a little

1821
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,599
bit more too and i should probably

1822
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,640
provide the same kind of feedback that

1823
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,760
wojtek did

1824
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,760
and i haven't done that yet

1825
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,600
but i think it's shaping up quite well

1826
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,640
and it'll be a useful addition i do too

1827
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,440
i think this is going to be a very

1828
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,440
useful document

1829
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,080
yeah we will be very happy to uh receive

1830
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,080
further comments

1831
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,559
from rania and from the team and uh

1832
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,280
we'll we'll be updating the document

1833
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,560
uh based on the recent uh comments and

1834
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:05,360
the questions

1835
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,920
uh people just asked during the uh this

1836
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,320
meeting

1837
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,360
yeah there's a hand raised from phillip

1838
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,960
helen baker

1839
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:16,639
if they still want to ask it

1840
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,120
uh yeah actually make comment on the

1841
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,199
security considerations

1842
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,760
i think it's important to freight to

1843
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,040
frame things correctly

1844
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,040
and what you have here is not

1845
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,519
cryptography it is

1846
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,560
transmission security which is a

1847
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,159
separate field

1848
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:38,239
from uh cryptography

1849
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:41,280
and presenting this as the solution to

1850
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:43,040
quantum computing's attack on pki i

1851
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,480
don't think is particularly

1852
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:49,519
useful for two reasons first

1853
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,400
kerberos is quantum resistant

1854
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,040
you know we've got a 45 year old system

1855
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,239
that is

1856
01:11:53,040 --> 01:12:00,400
actually a key distribution system that

1857
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:03,519
is resistant to quantum cryptanalysis

1858
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:07,280
the second reason is that

1859
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:10,560
communication security is what the field

1860
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:12,719
is able to do today you know if you look

1861
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,120
at the breaches that are happening today

1862
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:17,360
they're not communications breaches you

1863
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,480
know tls is taking care of that

1864
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,599
ipsec to a lesser extent the problem

1865
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,678
that we have

1866
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:29,280
is securing data at rest

1867
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:32,239
and none of what i'm seeing here

1868
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,759
is presenting me with tools that's going

1869
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,718
to secure data at rest

1870
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,520
so it's interesting work i think there's

1871
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,960
a valid

1872
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,159
use case for a quantum internet

1873
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,159
but framing it in terms of you're going

1874
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,120
to solve the problems of the security

1875
01:12:46,159 --> 01:12:51,040
world

1876
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:53,040
i i don't think is helpful

1877
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,800
can you point to uh specific places in

1878
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:58,239
the document where you think that

1879
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,719
that language needs to be updated uh

1880
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:01,759
well it comes in in the security

1881
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:05,360
considerations

1882
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,159
part uh which you know i'm a security

1883
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,440
guy so that's

1884
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:13,120
the part that i read first uh but

1885
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:17,199
but it's also you know um

1886
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,440
they it's trying to present this as

1887
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:21,519
i mean the thing is that the word

1888
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,360
transmission security

1889
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,719
doesn't appear in the document but

1890
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:28,159
security is

1891
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:28,800
used repeatedly and also from the

1892
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:32,239
previous

1893
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,719
uh uh presentation i think it's an

1894
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:37,759
unhelpful way of framing things

1895
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,400
i think it's important that we get the

1896
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:41,360
framing

1897
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:43,120
right because what you've got here is

1898
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,080
basically the killer

1899
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:46,800
version of transmission security and

1900
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:49,519
quantum

1901
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,159
is really really good for that and will

1902
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,159
surpass

1903
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,400
anything like frequency hopping or

1904
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:58,080
whatever

1905
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,400
and within the you know the limitations

1906
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,400
uh

1907
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,920
that people who go for transmission

1908
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,280
security today

1909
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:07,600
um you know it's probably even is

1910
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,239
easier to deploy than some of the other

1911
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,239
techniques

1912
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,960
but presenting it in terms of this is a

1913
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,960
replacement for pki

1914
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,960
i think really

1915
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:22,480
is a bad strategy

1916
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,400
this conversation probably becomes long

1917
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,679
but but do you think

1918
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,519
pki or uh pqc is actually

1919
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:36,000
does that actually protect data that's

1920
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,000
at rest

1921
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:42,320
peak there are techniques

1922
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,239
that are being developed that are

1923
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,799
looking at uh data at rest

1924
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:48,639
specifically my work which is threshold

1925
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,840
key infrastructure

1926
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:54,960
um so yeah i mean like

1927
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:57,280
pki isn't ideal for data at rest you

1928
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,400
need to extend it a bit uh by splitting

1929
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,440
up the keys but

1930
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,719
it's still pki

1931
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:04,719
speaker on steroids

1932
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,800
what is sorry what did you call yours

1933
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:13,360
the the not threshold

1934
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,360
infrastructure

1935
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:22,960
and the point is that you're not going

1936
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,960
to be able to take this framework and

1937
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,640
extend it to data at rest which is

1938
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,239
actually what we can

1939
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,159
that's what people are really being

1940
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:33,040
concerned about with quantum

1941
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,000
and doing things like uh all that stored

1942
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,920
data

1943
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,640
the data that we encrypt today that we

1944
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,280
want to keep secret

1945
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,199
that is what is really scaring us

1946
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,759
because you know if i ain't encrypted

1947
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:46,559
top secret or compartmentalized security

1948
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:53,840
document

1949
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:53,840
it has to be secure for 30 years

1950
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,799
i understand what you're saying i'm i'm

1951
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:01,440
not sure yet

1952
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,239
if i if i agree that the document

1953
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:04,559
actually needs

1954
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:05,440
updating it does talk about secure

1955
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,840
communication

1956
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,839
setup

1957
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,440
well it's a question being clear about

1958
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,560
the types of security that you're

1959
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:17,599
providing

1960
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,920
she provided right

1961
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,480
you're providing transmission security

1962
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,800
uh you're providing confidentiality

1963
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,000
uh we have to look into the traffic

1964
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,000
analysis issue

1965
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,920
it's not clear to me that you don't

1966
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:35,840
provide any traffic analysis

1967
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,840
uh control but we'd have to look at that

1968
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,600
uh thanks for those comments phil those

1969
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,000
would be very useful also on the mailing

1970
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,040
list

1971
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,440
uh so that others could process uh them

1972
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,440
and they're right

1973
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,679
i think that would be greatly valued as

1974
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:51,759
well so if you can also

1975
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:52,800
write that on an email summarizing what

1976
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,080
the comments you've made so that they

1977
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,480
could be acted upon

1978
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,360
that would be very good okay i'll do

1979
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:00,080
that

1980
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,440
thanks a lot uh we'll have to move on

1981
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,559
now

1982
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,559
so i'll hand over to

1983
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,800
rodney to chair because i'm presenting

1984
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:11,199
next

1985
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:13,440
all right i think the the the last uh or

1986
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:13,839
next to last agenda item other than open

1987
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,360
mic

1988
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:17,920
is uh wi-tech's um architecture

1989
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,480
principles

1990
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,120
for a quantum internet talk why tech you

1991
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,839
want to go ahead and

1992
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,440
share your slides i'm shang you can turn

1993
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:28,719
off your video if you want

1994
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,719
you're gonna

1995
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,840
um let's see i think we put 20 minutes

1996
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,960
on the agenda for

1997
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,440
this didn't we yeah but we have about

1998
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,199
40 minutes left in the in the session so

1999
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,040
if it runs uh long that's okay although

2000
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,960
we do probably do want to

2001
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,400
reserve some time for open mic at the

2002
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,679
end

2003
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:53,280
this draft also should be pretty close

2004
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:56,560
to ready to go for for at least

2005
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,639
the rg last call before it goes to irsg

2006
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,320
so we should be starting to look at

2007
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,679
things in you know the final level of

2008
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,480
detail including word smithing and

2009
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,480
things like that i think

2010
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:08,239
okay why tech um i'm going to turn my

2011
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,440
camera off when you see me pop my camera

2012
01:18:08,239 --> 01:18:12,000
back up that means you've been talking

2013
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:15,519
for about 18 minutes

2014
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,760
thanks uh so

2015
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,960
right so we've been working on this

2016
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,320
document now

2017
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:26,960
for almost two

2018
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:30,480
well a year and a half now i guess uh

2019
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,040
so the recap uh the document i'm talking

2020
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,360
about

2021
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,960
is architectural principles of a quantum

2022
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,920
internet uh linked below it's on the

2023
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,040
data tracker

2024
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,760
uh as usual uh

2025
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:42,320
it's been worked on since ietf 104 in

2026
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,880
prague

2027
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,559
back in 2019 and the key motivation of

2028
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:50,480
this document

2029
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,199
uh is to basically we have a charter

2030
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:53,440
point

2031
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,320
uh to create an architectural framework

2032
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:56,559
delineating

2033
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:58,000
network node roles and definitions to

2034
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,760
build a common vocabulary

2035
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,360
as the first step towards network

2036
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,880
architecture

2037
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,400
and that was the motivation for which i

2038
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,400
first actually submitted the first draft

2039
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,440
and also uh it's also educational to a

2040
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,239
large extent and i think in the end it

2041
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:15,199
will become

2042
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:15,839
that more uh as well and because it's a

2043
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,599
great start

2044
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,120
i want it to be a great starting point

2045
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,320
for people with more quantum background

2046
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,320
and i think it'd be a very useful

2047
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,679
document for the rest of the ietf and

2048
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,799
iot community

2049
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:30,080
if it can fulfill that goal

2050
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:34,320
uh this fyi the document is on

2051
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,199
github uh it's basically it's just as an

2052
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,559
update just

2053
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,320
that's where all the changes are tracked

2054
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,679
and i only update the data tracker

2055
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,840
before the meeting so that there's an

2056
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:45,679
official data tracker update

2057
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:47,280
but i will just update github in between

2058
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,360
except that if it's approaching near

2059
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:52,800
completion that will be

2060
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:54,480
not happening as often uh i wanted to

2061
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:57,679
actually do a bit of also

2062
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,080
uh i guess showing off like what i've

2063
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,040
seen

2064
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,840
uh uh i the document has actually been

2065
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,040
cited

2066
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,719
uh what's been cited primarily by people

2067
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,000
affiliated to the authors or the authors

2068
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,239
themselves but

2069
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,320
i found two papers that are actually

2070
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,199
citing uh the internet draft that were

2071
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:16,320
not affiliated

2072
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:17,440
to any of the authors so i found that

2073
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,920
actually quite interesting

2074
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:21,759
given that this document was not written

2075
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,320
or presented at academic conferences to

2076
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,320
be cited

2077
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,759
so it's actually also a good argument to

2078
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:29,040
actually expedite publishing it as an

2079
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:31,520
rfc

2080
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,840
given that internet drafts are not a

2081
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,280
permanent record

2082
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,880
and also just like from my own

2083
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,080
conversations with other people i often

2084
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,360
actually share these documents to

2085
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:41,679
networking people as a

2086
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:42,880
quick introduction uh and they often

2087
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,840
like it so

2088
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:47,520
uh well as i point out it's obviously a

2089
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,239
biased sample but i hope actually it

2090
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:50,560
does serve the

2091
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:52,320
same purpose for other people who have a

2092
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,280
much stronger networking background than

2093
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,519
they do have a quantum background

2094
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:00,480
anyway uh to the actual core material

2095
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:03,760
what are the changes since last meeting

2096
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:05,599
uh i added a control plane and two data

2097
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,960
plane subsection to kind of explain our

2098
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,360
distinction between

2099
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,560
classical and quantum data plane as well

2100
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,120
as what did we define as the control

2101
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,440
plane

2102
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,120
but as was pointed out and based on also

2103
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,919
on our previous conversation in this

2104
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,519
meeting is

2105
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:20,000
it needs kind of alignment with the use

2106
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,679
case document uh

2107
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,120
so that we're all consistent on what's

2108
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:26,239
defined as the control plane and what

2109
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,320
are the data flames we're talking about

2110
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:29,440
uh i added a note based on some feedback

2111
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,400
on the mailing list

2112
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,759
that passive optical elements uh are

2113
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,320
allowed and that's actually quite

2114
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:37,120
important

2115
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,920
for going forward uh with the network

2116
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,760
architecture

2117
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,960
because uh it kind of emphasizes the

2118
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,960
fact that we can we can

2119
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,960
switch entanglement over short distances

2120
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,440
without quantum repeaters

2121
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:51,040
uh as long as we do not use active

2122
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,320
optical elements

2123
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:54,480
uh but that's obviously then you're

2124
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:57,599
bound still by the distance

2125
01:21:54,480 --> 01:22:00,480
uh over which you can transmit uh

2126
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,040
photons without loss uh as josh

2127
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:04,718
mentioned

2128
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,760
in his talk uh

2129
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,159
i also added some additional

2130
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,120
clarifications and some a point that was

2131
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,120
kind of

2132
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,080
long i've been kind of putting off for a

2133
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:14,480
really long time which is adding

2134
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,519
references to academic literature

2135
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:20,159
uh they're now all added uh so hopefully

2136
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,800
the document is apart from just a slight

2137
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:23,280
uh

2138
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,960
aim attempt to synchronize the use case

2139
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:27,759
draft with this in terms of control

2140
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:30,480
plane it should be complete

2141
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,600
essentially as a question is the draft

2142
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,879
ready for

2143
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,880
error rg last call

2144
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,880
and that's kind of it for me not much in

2145
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,639
terms of presenting addresses for

2146
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,440
questions and people

2147
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:44,159
trying to get any last clarifications

2148
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,239
before we

2149
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:48,799
move on with official steps for last

2150
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,799
call stuff

2151
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,719
all right i didn't have to wait until 18

2152
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:56,719
minutes to pop my camera back up

2153
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:11,360
questions comments complaints criticisms

2154
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,360
advice agreements

2155
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,159
arguments

2156
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:35,840
someone unmuted

2157
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:44,509
anyone

2158
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:44,510
[Laughter]

2159
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,679
all right yeah white tech i actually

2160
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:52,080
have a comment or two

2161
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:54,560
mostly some small ones um

2162
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:57,000
i went back through my list of uh

2163
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:00,000
comments that i sent back in

2164
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
february

2165
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:03,839
compared to this

2166
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:12,239
yeah and

2167
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:14,400
um i know we went through some of these

2168
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:15,599
on the mailing list but i don't remember

2169
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:19,599
the status of

2170
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,600
everything every each individual

2171
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,800
concept or each individual point that i

2172
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,519
had brought up

2173
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,920
um did we end up with discussion of the

2174
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,840
first

2175
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,520
second and third generation networks in

2176
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,960
this yes

2177
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:36,960
uh contribution to the document

2178
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,400
oh yes i remember that which which

2179
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,400
section is that

2180
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,400
that's under error management

2181
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,880
there should be something like that

2182
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:59,840
[Laughter]

2183
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,840
error management 4.4.3

2184
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:14,560
quantum error correction

2185
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:16,400
i'm trying to load it so i can also

2186
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:19,120
share the screen with others but it's

2187
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,120
going very slow

2188
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,800
uh the couple of paragraphs that are

2189
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:28,560
here are fine but it doesn't really uh

2190
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,840
well yes it does yeah first generation

2191
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:30,320
second generation third generation is

2192
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,880
here

2193
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:37,199
error management schemes okay okay

2194
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,080
uh the other specific one we had was it

2195
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,960
was um

2196
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:42,000
actually kind of a minor wordsmithing

2197
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,520
stuff

2198
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,120
i didn't particularly like having

2199
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,639
tomorrow in the title of one of the

2200
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,760
sub-sections you talked about support

2201
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:51,760
for tomorrow's

2202
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:55,120
applications in 10 years or 20 years or

2203
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:56,960
30 years what counts as tomorrow

2204
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,040
kind of white i feel like tomorrow's big

2205
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,560
but yeah that can be modified

2206
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:09,519
there's a suggestion on the mailing list

2207
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:11,840
happy to change

2208
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:13,360
i did not go go through everything on

2209
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:14,960
the mailing list to see sort of how we

2210
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,759
were relative to each individual item on

2211
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:17,120
the mailing list

2212
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,440
i was assuming you were taking care of

2213
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,800
that yeah yeah i i

2214
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:37,759
kept track about that i think i've

2215
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:40,159
updated addressed all the issues

2216
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:41,760
i guess in the absence of other comments

2217
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:42,239
does that mean the group's positive

2218
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,840
about

2219
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:48,080
having lost colin moving forward with

2220
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:48,080
the rfc barring some awards may think

2221
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,840
and

2222
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,840
one thing i do think we should do before

2223
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,800
we declare either one of these ready for

2224
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:02,320
for our last

2225
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:04,000
call is we should actually sit down and

2226
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:05,840
read them in parallel and make sure the

2227
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,520
two of them don't don't uh disagree in

2228
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:10,159
any substantial

2229
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:11,679
um either technical uh or uh or

2230
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:15,440
terminology

2231
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:17,920
basis i've read them both you know with

2232
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,480
days or weeks between readings and so so

2233
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,000
i haven't

2234
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:23,839
tried to actually do that yeah

2235
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,199
uh well i guess perhaps because i

2236
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,600
actually did actually say

2237
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,879
in this presentation that uh there still

2238
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:30,639
needs to be alignment on the control

2239
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:31,920
plane which addresses your

2240
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,960
thing that these documents should be

2241
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:38,239
consistent with each other uh

2242
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,920
perhaps i'll let's keep this question of

2243
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:42,159
last call for the mailing list

2244
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,600
uh rather than answer it right now

2245
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:45,199
because i still need to update that

2246
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:48,080
control plane section at least or this

2247
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,080
make sure it's consistent

2248
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,920
i do want to give it one final complete

2249
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:59,120
end and read before i think

2250
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:02,320
before i i'm ready to sign off on it

2251
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:02,559
sure that's on me as as both an author

2252
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,759
and

2253
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,760
and as as the chair

2254
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:15,840
uh cool then that's it for me there are

2255
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,840
no questions from the group

2256
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:29,840
anyone else

2257
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,480
all right let's ask how many people in

2258
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,440
the group have read

2259
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:47,280
the uh this architecture document let's

2260
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:50,638
see what draft is this this is

2261
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:53,040
this is a version five right um

2262
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:54,880
how many people have read either a draft

2263
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,040
four or draft five

2264
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,920
uh how about we use the show of hands

2265
01:28:57,040 --> 01:29:00,800
tool

2266
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,480
uh so that should be a way to do that i

2267
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:07,440
don't know exactly how to do it yes

2268
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:07,440
so there's okay i'll ask the questions

2269
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,080
are you specifically interested in that

2270
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,599
version for version five

2271
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,719
well i think it's probably good to ask

2272
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,400
how many people have looked at it

2273
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,000
relatively recently i think the update

2274
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:25,360
between four and five was not huge

2275
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,040
so i think either four or five is

2276
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,320
probably good enough

2277
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,280
but you know some of the earlier ones

2278
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,599
there were pretty some some pretty

2279
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:35,120
drastic changes between you know

2280
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:39,360
000 and 01 and o2

2281
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:41,280
okay so let's see how this works uh

2282
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,960
oh i've just asked the question and i

2283
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:47,440
guess now participants have to

2284
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,440
raise their hand or not raise their hand

2285
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,280
i think for those who are looking for it

2286
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,840
i don't know how it shows up to other

2287
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,840
people

2288
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,159
yeah it shows up to me okay

2289
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:07,679
so i guess if we wait at least for least

2290
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:10,480
half or at least until it stay converges

2291
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,840
stabilizes for those looking for it i

2292
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,280
assume it's on the

2293
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,400
left show off hands i don't know how it

2294
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,599
actually shows up for other people

2295
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,960
yeah i think it showed up differently

2296
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,679
for me because i'm chair too but it

2297
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,800
showed up on

2298
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:25,920
his participants chat and then

2299
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,440
raise your hand was the left most in the

2300
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,760
panel with the participants in chat

2301
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,759
window

2302
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:33,920
directly below the raise your hand join

2303
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,159
the cue

2304
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,159
button

2305
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,320
looks like a dozen people have actually

2306
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:44,639
read it and that's actually pretty good

2307
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,639
i think

2308
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,840
recently

2309
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,520
okay well so about that many let's take

2310
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:57,920
it for a while this can

2311
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,600
stay on the walls we discuss it 12

2312
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,880
people have read it so

2313
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:06,480
i don't know diego

2314
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:08,719
uh and uh let's see

2315
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,320
diego and joey both said they said that

2316
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,239
they read it and found it useful that

2317
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:17,840
they like it

2318
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:17,839
thanks uh yeah um

2319
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,080
i'd say if we've had a dozen people

2320
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,679
actually read it recently then we've had

2321
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:25,120
sort of a good set of eyes on it but i

2322
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,239
do want to give it one more complete

2323
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:28,080
read

2324
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,678
next to the other before i'm ready to

2325
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:32,639
sign off

2326
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:34,400
sure sounds good uh i'm not in a

2327
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,000
particular rush but yeah

2328
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:39,199
hopefully maybe before the next actual

2329
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,600
ietf meeting that we do attend

2330
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:43,199
uh well i would actually like to see it

2331
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,800
for for our last call and sent to the

2332
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,559
irs g

2333
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,480
within the next couple of weeks if we

2334
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,080
can achieve that because uh

2335
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,000
by the first of december where we're

2336
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,519
we're moving into end of the year mode

2337
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,120
where where people's distraction level

2338
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,239
gets high

2339
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,760
yeah shall we move on

2340
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:01,280
to the open floor then or is there

2341
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,360
anything else that you want to say on

2342
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:05,840
there

2343
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,320
that's all i had on on the the uh on the

2344
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,320
draft

2345
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:14,718
uh cool so the last item on the

2346
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,320
agenda is open floor

2347
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:18,960
which i guess is an opportunity for

2348
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,960
everybody to

2349
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,719
ask any questions they have like i i

2350
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:24,400
think

2351
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,320
all questions about the quantum internet

2352
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,000
should be askable

2353
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:29,360
also opinions on what the curator should

2354
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,199
do next in light of

2355
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:32,559
wait let me actually share my initial

2356
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:36,559
slide for the next

2357
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,560
uh steps that i proposed

2358
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:44,320
let's see josh is still here also so

2359
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,239
so uh if anybody has questions going

2360
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:48,719
back to the first presentation on

2361
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:51,360
mdi we can also go back and talk about

2362
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,440
talk about those

2363
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:54,400
uh so if anybody has any suggestions of

2364
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,400
uh

2365
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,759
other than what's kind of concurrently

2366
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,559
on the screen of the next steps for the

2367
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:00,800
qrg

2368
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,400
opinions and also just any questions uh

2369
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,520
they can be technical questions as well

2370
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,638
as to

2371
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:08,560
how does quantum stuff work etc uh

2372
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,920
groups meant to be aimed for

2373
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:11,760
collaboration

2374
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:14,480
and kind of education is part of their

2375
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:23,840
collaboration so

2376
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:23,839
yeah so open floor

2377
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:30,799
hi colin

2378
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:39,600
hey can you hear me yes

2379
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,719
good good um so unfortunately i missed

2380
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,600
the beginning but uh

2381
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,480
it was uh wondering if uh prototyping

2382
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,760
and testing was

2383
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:49,678
uh one of the next steps you know

2384
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,880
to try and validate some of the the

2385
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,360
ideas and the drafts in

2386
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:55,360
in experimental implementations

2387
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
uh that's actually a really good

2388
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,679
question for either joshua or

2389
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,080
wojtek is you guys are actually

2390
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:08,000
building a network and does your

2391
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:10,480
implementation actually conform in some

2392
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,520
useful fashion to the architecture

2393
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:15,678
document uh

2394
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:18,239
so yes thanks colin that's a great

2395
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,679
question yes so josh basically as he

2396
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:22,959
said in his talk uh

2397
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:25,040
there will be a first link up uh between

2398
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,679
delft and the hague by the end of this

2399
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:31,040
year uh it's going online

2400
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:32,719
so that what that is one example uh

2401
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:34,719
more practically in terms of how

2402
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,719
something that directly feeds off from

2403
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,639
prog work

2404
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:40,080
then yes next year so josh also

2405
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,159
mentioned that next year we're upgrading

2406
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:44,960
to quantum repeaters

2407
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:45,759
uh and yes the protocols we are

2408
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,880
implementing

2409
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:50,320
over there are inspired by

2410
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:51,650
all the discussions have been happening

2411
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,920
here uh

2412
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:58,000
[Music]

2413
01:34:53,920 --> 01:35:00,239
so and like for i recently uh

2414
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,159
uploaded to the archive an article of

2415
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:04,799
the network layer protocol

2416
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,759
uh that we will be implementing uh on

2417
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,040
the actual

2418
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,440
uh setup for example uh and there's also

2419
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,600
the

2420
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:14,239
uh a ln clear protocol that has already

2421
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,840
previously been published

2422
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:17,599
essentially all of like especially the

2423
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,800
network layer work feeds off

2424
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,239
our discussions in the qrg and we are

2425
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,400
going to be running

2426
01:35:22,239 --> 01:35:25,440
actual tests and prototyping of that

2427
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,080
early next year

2428
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,440
and we will be publishing that soon and

2429
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,760
though as josh also mentioned there will

2430
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,320
be

2431
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:32,800
q a quantum network experience which

2432
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,759
will be

2433
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,560
a web front-end for people to actually

2434
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,320
run

2435
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,840
their own quantum distributed

2436
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:42,880
applications on top of

2437
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:46,159
an experimental network at some point

2438
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,600
uh next year hopefully so

2439
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,360
yes that's a good point to raise we'll

2440
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,679
keep people updated and posted about all

2441
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,679
of that

2442
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,879
i'm posting a link in the chat

2443
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,119
yeah it would be good to get some some

2444
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:07,519
implementation

2445
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:10,960
results for experiment experiment

2446
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:14,080
reports in the group as well

2447
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,080
yeah we'll have some very soon

2448
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,678
and josh clearly knows enough to speak

2449
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:21,440
the uh the

2450
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,280
networking lingo so so josh is

2451
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:26,480
definitely a keeper we want we want him

2452
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,480
around as much as we can get him

2453
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:34,000
thank you very much rodney that's nice

2454
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:34,000
to hear thank you

2455
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,639
i did have a question going back to that

2456
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,520
which i think is actually related to

2457
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,639
show does

2458
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:46,560
uh wojtek may also uh have

2459
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,920
some comments on this you know shot and

2460
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,360
i were both sort of initially a little

2461
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,119
bit confused about the

2462
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:55,759
the whether the mdi

2463
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:56,480
central node actually has to be trusted

2464
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,159
or not

2465
01:36:56,480 --> 01:37:00,080
um part of that goes to the definition

2466
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:01,599
of what counts as a node

2467
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,119
which in some of the work that we've

2468
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,719
done we've sort of waffled back and

2469
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:08,400
forth about that

2470
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:11,360
so your midpoint

2471
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,280
node that serves as the bell state

2472
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:17,519
analyzer

2473
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:18,559
we have debated off and on for years as

2474
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,280
to whether

2475
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,440
that counts only as part of the link and

2476
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:25,519
therefore is not visible

2477
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:26,799
in hops further down there further down

2478
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,360
the the path

2479
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,719
or if it's actually a full first-class

2480
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:33,040
network node

2481
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:35,440
and we had decided at one point that we

2482
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:37,119
thought it belonged only to the link

2483
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:39,040
but we had not looked at at this

2484
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,599
multi-point switching star-shaped kind

2485
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,800
of

2486
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:43,840
of architecture that you're talking

2487
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,840
about for mdi

2488
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,840
more recently for some of the work that

2489
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,000
we've been doing on graph state quantum

2490
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,040
repeaters which we haven't published yet

2491
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:54,880
we have decided that that the the the

2492
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,719
bell state analyzers

2493
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,920
need to actually be pretty sophisticated

2494
01:37:56,719 --> 01:37:58,400
and need to participate in the

2495
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,800
end-to-end

2496
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:02,000
communications so our opinion on whether

2497
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:04,159
those are nodes or

2498
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,679
or or whether they're nodes that are

2499
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,199
visible at the network level

2500
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,199
or whether they're just part of the link

2501
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:11,119
our own opinion about that has changed

2502
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:12,239
in the last year or so

2503
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:17,759
i don't know if either of you wants to

2504
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:19,119
comment on that

2505
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,960
right so you're saying the midpoint

2506
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:24,559
should i be active

2507
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:27,440
participant in the network now

2508
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:28,320
there's some more experiences bruno also

2509
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:32,239
commented

2510
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:34,000
on that on the in the case of mdi qkd

2511
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:35,119
the middle node facilitates star shape

2512
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,119
so it also includes

2513
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:39,119
mems cross connects and things like that

2514
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:39,599
it's more than just a bsm it's more than

2515
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:41,519
just a

2516
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,960
bell state measurement device or a bell

2517
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,920
steel analyzer

2518
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,520
uh yes for mdi i think it is and also

2519
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,239
for the graph state

2520
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,560
based repeaters which we haven't talked

2521
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:54,480
about yet at all in qirg at all but i

2522
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,400
think for both of those cases

2523
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,919
the bell state analyzer probably has to

2524
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,280
be a full-fledged network that

2525
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,040
participates in

2526
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,320
routing and security and appears in the

2527
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,480
network topology and

2528
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:06,239
all those sorts of things whereas you

2529
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:08,559
know a year ago our opinion was that it

2530
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,559
shouldn't

2531
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,360
speaking as an individual you know

2532
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,360
running running our own research group

2533
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,600
josh said in the comments here he also

2534
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:21,199
believes that the midpoints and center

2535
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,239
notes should be active participants

2536
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:24,839
because it's acting to bring

2537
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:27,519
point-to-point uh point to multi-point

2538
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,280
functionality yeah yeah so the mdi

2539
01:39:27,520 --> 01:39:32,400
use case actually brings that up pretty

2540
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,400
clearly to to uh to

2541
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,639
how important that is in that respect i

2542
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:38,840
suppose yeah if i

2543
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,000
the way my thinking has been going is

2544
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:42,560
that

2545
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,840
the bell measurement station the

2546
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,800
midpoint

2547
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,440
is a very so especially the star

2548
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,480
networks

2549
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:54,239
that mdi qkd will work on and

2550
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:57,519
josh showed i find

2551
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:59,519
to an extent an analogy between local

2552
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:01,600
area networks and layer two networks

2553
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:02,800
and what can be achieved with such a

2554
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,360
midpoint station

2555
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,840
uh where we have a kind of local area

2556
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,920
network

2557
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,520
around a single bell state measurement

2558
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,440
station where we can have multiple end

2559
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:14,400
nodes connected to one

2560
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:17,199
and the switching is done by the valve

2561
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:18,719
state measurement in the middle

2562
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:20,638
and this involves no entanglement

2563
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:22,719
swapping well it does

2564
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:24,480
but no quantum repeater entanglement

2565
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:27,600
swapping

2566
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:30,000
uh just that midpoint station

2567
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:31,360
and then when we want to go beyond these

2568
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,880
local area networks we need

2569
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:34,639
gen proper quantum repeaters with

2570
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:37,119
quantum memories

2571
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,760
which can perform an entanglement swap

2572
01:40:37,119 --> 01:40:41,119
on a

2573
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,600
stored qubit and start qubits and that's

2574
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:44,159
kind of

2575
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,760
closer to our what we know as layer 3

2576
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:49,360
network

2577
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,119
layer networks so i do actually agree

2578
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:52,719
that perhaps the midpoint

2579
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:54,639
well not perhaps i do agree that the

2580
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:58,639
midpoint is

2581
01:40:54,639 --> 01:41:00,560
an active element and will

2582
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:02,400
draw analogies to local area networks

2583
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,080
and in fact most realistic deployments

2584
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,440
early deployments might actually be just

2585
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,239
multiple end nodes around a single

2586
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,839
midpoint station

2587
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:10,080
at least practical deployment talking

2588
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,679
about experimental deployments

2589
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:15,440
will probably be a single central

2590
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,440
station and multiple end nodes

2591
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:19,840
okay

2592
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:24,719
other questions anybody have another

2593
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,719
topic they want to bring up

2594
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:33,679
can one cascade and one cascade

2595
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:36,719
midpoints

2596
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:39,840
um you can certainly cascade

2597
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:41,119
optical switches if your end-to-end loss

2598
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:43,199
is low enough

2599
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:45,199
but the end points with the measurement

2600
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:46,159
devices themselves or sorry the

2601
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,839
midpoints

2602
01:41:46,159 --> 01:41:50,080
with the with the measurement devices

2603
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,639
themselves

2604
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,639
probably not

2605
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:56,400
yeah the way i understand the question

2606
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,840
i'm going to say no because

2607
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:01,119
you need a very good synchronization

2608
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:04,639
between the two end nodes

2609
01:42:01,119 --> 01:42:04,639
using the submit point in order to

2610
01:42:06,239 --> 01:42:10,239
uh uh kiriti the

2611
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:15,920
extended the explanation a little bit if

2612
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:17,040
abc connect to md1 and md1 connects to

2613
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,159
md2

2614
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:23,679
and then md2 connects to def so

2615
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:25,519
now in this current hardware the mds

2616
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:29,119
only receive right so your connection

2617
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:32,400
between md1 and md2 there

2618
01:42:29,119 --> 01:42:34,799
it's only going to receive

2619
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,799
but if you put another if you put node g

2620
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,320
in between md1 and md2

2621
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,400
then you would have a large network with

2622
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:43,679
multiple hops and then you're doing

2623
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:46,960
multiple hops of mdi where you have

2624
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:50,239
multiple memories involved um josh

2625
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,239
could probably answer that

2626
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:57,840
um but yeah

2627
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,159
bruno says you need quantum repeaters to

2628
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,239
do multi-hop md iq

2629
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:06,320
qkd which that certainly agrees with

2630
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:08,879
maya

2631
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,320
my understanding at which point um at

2632
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,760
that point you're doing

2633
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:15,759
um entanglement based qkd

2634
01:43:13,760 --> 01:43:17,840
you know maybe like the eckerd protocol

2635
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:21,520
the e91 protocol

2636
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:23,199
rather than pure mdi and at that point

2637
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:25,040
you are doing end to end but you also

2638
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:27,519
have to be able to generate

2639
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:30,080
end to end entanglement which is still

2640
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,080
the hard part

2641
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:37,040
um josh did you want to you want to pop

2642
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:40,239
in voice wise and talk about

2643
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:40,239
what you were just talking about there

2644
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:45,280
yeah sure sorry it was just uh in

2645
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:48,719
regards to the discussion of

2646
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:49,679
whether midpoints are um active in the

2647
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:52,080
network

2648
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:53,840
so the what i was writing was that the

2649
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,239
the chinese network is essentially a

2650
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,239
long

2651
01:43:54,239 --> 01:44:00,400
connection of um almost like super

2652
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:02,080
super nodes they're trusted nodes or

2653
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:04,719
something like super nodes and then many

2654
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:07,360
users can connect to these super nodes

2655
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:09,760
uh in almost a star-like fashion

2656
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:10,719
so one way to see this network is really

2657
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,239
a large

2658
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:17,679
a chain of midpoint type stations

2659
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:20,320
with um each midpoint station having its

2660
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:23,760
own spar network around it

2661
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:24,480
yeah and i believe the the american

2662
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,920
network

2663
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:31,040
um between new york and new jersey

2664
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:34,320
uh will have a similar physical topology

2665
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:37,519
physical construction which

2666
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:38,639
which then to me uh adds to the argument

2667
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,480
that the midpoints are

2668
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,480
are active elements inside the network

2669
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,000
who's leading the new york to new jersey

2670
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:49,840
work and is that is there something

2671
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,840
public about that

2672
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,639
this is an organization called quantum

2673
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,920
exchange

2674
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:57,920
okay i know then

2675
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,119
um joey also has a question in the chat

2676
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,840
here josh you might be the right person

2677
01:45:01,119 --> 01:45:03,839
to answer that

2678
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:11,040
uh i'll just read it out loud uh

2679
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,880
if the measurements and qubit operations

2680
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,400
during the secure communication setup

2681
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,960
referring to the use cases draft and

2682
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:18,480
follow-up from ietf

2683
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,239
regarding data description can be

2684
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:22,320
potentially used to identify truck the

2685
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:26,559
user establishing that setup

2686
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:26,559
so basically is the qkd connection setup

2687
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:34,639
anonymous

2688
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:37,919
and i would

2689
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:39,360
uh i would say well it's as anonymous as

2690
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,400
normal control plane traffic to be

2691
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:44,080
honest it's actually

2692
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:46,239
not unless you protect it yeah no it's

2693
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:48,400
not anonymous unless somebody corrects

2694
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,400
me

2695
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,320
it would be interesting to try to build

2696
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:56,839
something anonymous on top of it but the

2697
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:58,320
most obvious implementation i think is

2698
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:00,320
not

2699
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:02,000
to get anonymous communication i think

2700
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,599
so for quantum key distribution i think

2701
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,280
it would be difficult to build anonymity

2702
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,920
on top but there are other

2703
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:09,360
applications which do quantum based

2704
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:11,520
distributed quantum-based applications

2705
01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:13,199
which do guarantee anonymity but we have

2706
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:14,719
to go beyond quantum key distribution

2707
01:46:13,199 --> 01:46:16,000
networks into quantum information

2708
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,600
networks

2709
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,480
uh and they go into

2710
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:25,119
very this is beyond my expertise because

2711
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:26,638
it's application level for quantum

2712
01:46:25,119 --> 01:46:28,159
but there are things such as like

2713
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,520
anonymous quantum

2714
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:31,759
anonymous transmission in the quantum

2715
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,080
domain where you can transmit quantum

2716
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:36,880
data without your receiver actually

2717
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:38,800
knowing who it was transmitted from uh

2718
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,679
so there's scope for much more anonymity

2719
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:43,520
but it has to go

2720
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:43,520
but it's beyond quantum key distribution

2721
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:54,639
um before we get to the last couple of

2722
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:56,080
minutes here let's see is colin still

2723
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:57,840
here

2724
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:00,639
if colin's still here i'm pretty sure we

2725
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,480
did this uh last time but since we're

2726
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:04,239
since that was several months ago and

2727
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:07,360
we're closing in on final call for

2728
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:09,119
for these uh for these two drafts colin

2729
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,719
do you want do you want to to uh

2730
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:13,040
quickly toss in a word or two about

2731
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:15,920
about what the process needs to be

2732
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,920
to finish these off

2733
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:20,000
uh yeah i mean that the process for

2734
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:23,119
finishing the draft self

2735
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,440
is that you the the group and

2736
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:26,559
the chairs come to the uh conclusion

2737
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:30,080
that the work is done

2738
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:33,040
uh and then you send it to

2739
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,639
uh my myself uh there's the you can do

2740
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:37,360
this in the data tracker and then

2741
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:39,119
i arrange for the irsq to review it and

2742
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:41,759
give feedback

2743
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:44,559
um and uh most likely there will be some

2744
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:48,000
comments and the draft gets revised

2745
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:49,760
as a result of that there's a

2746
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,360
check that it doesn't conflict with any

2747
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:53,920
work in the ietf

2748
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:55,119
which i think in this case is unlikely

2749
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:57,840
and then it gets published

2750
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:57,839
as an rfc

2751
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:05,840
sounds good

2752
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,519
any other uh comments or questions uh

2753
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:12,638
we've got about 10 minutes left if we

2754
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,840
want to use it or we can

2755
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:20,000
give people an extra 10 minutes to to

2756
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:20,000
break for before before their next

2757
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:26,039
[Laughter]

2758
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:26,039
[Music]

2759
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,840
session

2760
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:41,440
bruno we'll look forward to your uh to

2761
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,440
your notes

2762
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:48,800
yeah thanks for the menace taking

2763
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,159
uh i think that basically wraps it up

2764
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,159
i'll

2765
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,440
stay online for the next 10 minutes

2766
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:56,239
myself at least

2767
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:57,360
uh if people want to ask questions but

2768
01:48:56,239 --> 01:49:01,839
overall i'd say

2769
01:48:57,360 --> 01:49:01,839
the meeting is basically over

2770
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:06,159
i think we can declare it closed um the

2771
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:07,600
i do think by the way we

2772
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:09,440
that we should actually try to meet face

2773
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,800
to face the next time all of iatf gets

2774
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:12,320
to meet face-to-face just because it's

2775
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:15,520
been a nice long time

2776
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,199
um the next let's see

2777
01:49:15,520 --> 01:49:19,280
march has already been declared to be

2778
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:23,040
online is that right

2779
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:25,040
i think i don't require to be online

2780
01:49:23,040 --> 01:49:27,199
so hopefully in july next year hopefully

2781
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:30,960
we'll see everybody in july

2782
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:30,960
i think that's optimistic but okay

2783
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,960
i think march is right out but i think

2784
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,679
but i think july has a reasonable shot

2785
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,679
of actually happening

2786
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:46,000
all right thank you all then we'll see

2787
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,599
you we'll see you on on the mailing list

2788
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,440
and hopefully in person sometime middle

2789
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:56,880
of next year

2790
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:59,598
yeah thanks everybody

2791
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:59,599
thanks wojtek

2792
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:05,280
yeah thanks rod uh

2793
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:08,719
and thanks colin and josh uh and

2794
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,719
everybody who uh contributed

2795
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:25,839
bye y'all i'm stepping out bye

2796
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:59,199
can can you hear me joshua still now

2797
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,440
i can hear you hear me okay

2798
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:07,360
thank you just wanted to check no

2799
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,280
questions or anything just wanted to

2800
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:10,719
to make sure that my mic was actually

2801
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:13,840
working

2802
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:15,840
okay thank you for staying um

2803
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,560
i'm actually just using the space here

2804
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:23,840
for the chat a little bit

2805
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:23,840
okay okay

2806
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:11,280
you
