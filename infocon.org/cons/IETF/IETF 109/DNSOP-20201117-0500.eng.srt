00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,880
so he is he has managed to sort of catch

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
the

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,880
the covid so so we hope he gets better

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,920
soon so he he contacted us the other day

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,119
and said he wasn't going to be able to

40

so she'll be working on that and as we

43
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
go to the next slide there will be the

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,400
meet

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,640
the note well about everybody

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
you know following all the iatf

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
processes and guidelines and stuff

48
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,640
and all the nice things for that and if

49
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
we go to the next slide

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,000
um you can sort of slide through these

51
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,679
our agenda is pretty straightforward

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
we've got some updates on the old work

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,599
we've got some that

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,879
going on now some current business and

55
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
some new business

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,160
um and we

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
did a little bad math so we're going to

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,319
run through the chair stuff

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
pretty quickly but you all should you

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,319
know

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,679
can read the slides as well so as we go

62
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,560
through the document updates

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
next since our last meeting we've had

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
four things

65
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,799
become rfcs which is pretty great no

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,679
response multi-provider dnsec

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,680
extended error and 2845 biz which

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
actually is in auth 48 i realized the

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
last minute

70
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,679
but i believe that should be all sort of

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,518
taken care of

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
the authors are sort of finishing up the

73
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,519
final edits there

74
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,640
so i may have jumped the gun on that one

75
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
but that's

76
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,319
that's been pretty great so congrats on

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,920
everybody

78
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,359
yep let's go to the next slide we have

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,798
two more things in the isgq zone digest

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
and server cookies

81
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
um server cookies just went through

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
working group last call

83
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,000
and um one of them were rating the

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
write-up which actually passed working

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,280
group last call

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
and benno was working on the write-up

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
but that'll probably be delayed another

88
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
a little bit as he sort of gets better

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
on the on the yang

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,640
stuff um so we still have some more

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,679
stuff moving forward so as we go to the

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,798
next slide

93
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
um in working group last call 7816 biz

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
actually i believe this should

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,599
this probably have finished passing i

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
just need to send out an email to sort

97

107
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,320
the authors of 7816 bisque we are

108
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,800
looking

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,919
at the um we got a bunch of good

110
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,560
comments

111
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
um the editorial ones are already in our

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,680
internal repo

113
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
um but there are actually some technical

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,280
changes that people asked for

115
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,680
um so we haven't uh done a new draft

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,638
and we also haven't discussed once we do

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
a new draft

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
if we're going to want a second working

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
group last call um a couple people had

120
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,680
asked for

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,599
um some changes which i think are

122
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,400
technical enough where we might want

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
review

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,239
especially from implementers um but it's

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,919
not clear the the

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,680
uh document authors are chatting with

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,400
each other but it absolutely is not

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,280
ready to

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,758
move forward yet okay

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,638
so yeah thanks for that we will uh look

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,759
for that as

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,960
uh it goes through i we want everybody

133
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:24,160
to be satisfied with it

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:27,359
before we go ahead and bounce it

135
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,240
and i'm not sure okay yeah and so um

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,759
thanks paul and we can take a look it

137
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
looks like it's normative type changes

138
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
we should do that

139
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
um there's a couple documents that i

140
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
feel are pretty

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,639
pretty much ready for working group

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,320
class call this the the hdb service b

143
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
the service speed draft they've done a

144
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
lot of great work on that

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,039
um and i've seen some good

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,240
implementations

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,400
and so barring anything i'm thinking

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,400
we'll probably do that in december

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,719
after the holidays after the american

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
holidays and also tcp requirements which

151
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,840
we've been sort of sitting on

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,840
um and and waiting to sort of do that

153
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,198
and we should probably just do that

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,119
and um moving on to the next slide

155
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
i believe there's a couple other

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,080
documents

157
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,479
um that are we've got oh yes

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,159
so on the opening calls for adoption um

159
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,719
84.99 biz

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,319
um we got some feedback from tony and a

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
few other people on some stuff

162
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
and i believe that adoption looks done

163
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,440
paul so we can adopt that

164
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
um merge in some of the terminology um

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,240
tour

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,759
comments that that we wanted to add as

167
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
well as some language stuff and sort of

168
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,319
get that

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,720
sort of rolling along and i'll send out

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,319
a note on that this week as well

171
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,000
so if we go to the next slide i know we

172
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,360
have

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,759
um oh yeah mostly what we can skip one

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
yep and everything everything sort of

175
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,479
sitting in our data tracker and also the

176
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,440
github

177
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,360
um we we have probably also a dozen

178
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,280
documents that have been adopted

179
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
and spending some time looking at them

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
this weekend

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
there's a few of them that i think are

182
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,719
getting very close to working good last

183
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,280
call as well

184
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,120
um a few of them being discussed today

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,679
and um

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
especially like the ns3 validation draft

187
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
the delegation

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,360
only is interesting um uh the the

189
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,560
fragmentation draft i think some of

190
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,319
these are getting really close to

191
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,319
getting working group last call

192
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,759
and so i believe what we'll do is the

193
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,639
chairs will probably start focusing on

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080
some of these

195
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,599
to start moving along and there's a

196
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
couple of small ones like the glue is on

197
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,520
optional

198
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,440
um that as well like mark's draft

199
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,039
that's pretty straightforward that i

200
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,319
think um

201
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,479
that's been adopted that we should

202
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,120
probably also sort of pack up and move

203
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,599
along

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,039
so that's i don't want to let too many

205
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,240
things sort of sit but we do have a lot

206
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,080
of stuff going on

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,080
all right next slide um

208
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
i think what we've got here is the

209
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
agenda so

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,639
um schumann's gonna talk about ns

211
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,400
revalidation

212
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,199
um dimitri is gonna give his 5933 biz

213
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,400
update

214
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,080
um there's um roy's going to talk about

215
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,919
the private use tld

216
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
mr fujiwara-san is going to talk about

217
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,878
avoid fragmentation

218
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,840
and then on the next slide some of the

219
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,639
new business which is um

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,119
paul's iana consideration draft which

221
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,840
kind of ties into the 5933 biz it's sort

222
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
of a

223
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,799
you know um discussion on

224
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
changing the registry and i know we

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,919
talked about this before and there is uh

226
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,560
some strong pro and con sort of thing um

227
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,799
and my news got um ip range location

228
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,159
and um ray's got the dynastop error page

229
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,439
draft these are some new things that are

230
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,599
coming out so

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,719
um we'll we'll kind of move things along

232
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,880
and we'll

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,360
we'll jump straight to schumann yeah

234
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,720
and get started so thanks all and any

235
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
other questions just sort of speak up

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,839
all right

237
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
hey folks can you hear me okay

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,959
sir there we go and let me just adjust

239
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,279
the size so we can look at one slide at

240
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,279
a time

241
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
there we go

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,440
there okay i guess that's good enough

243
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,440
yep sorry about that yep

244
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
all right so thank you uh suzanne and

245
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
tim

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,160
so i'm going to give an update on the

247
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
delegation revalidation draft so if you

248
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,680
can

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
advance to the next slide

250
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
yep there we go

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
all right so some quick background if

252
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,599
you haven't

253
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,279
paid attention to this we first

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,320
presented this draft at the

255
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,720
ietf i guess it was the itf virtual

256
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,839
in april uh 2020. so that was a

257
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
replacement for

258
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,120
the cancelled ietf107

259
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,720
i've provided a link to the slides here

260
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:12,480
um it was subsequently adopted by the

261
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,839
working group in june and there's a link

262
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,880
to the current

263
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
version of the draft and briefly to

264
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,920
remind folks the two

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,119
main recommendations are

266
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,319
the first is upgrading nsrs credibility

267
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,200
that means resolvers should

268
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
deterministically obtain the child an

269
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,480
asset and place it preferentially

270
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
in their cache and the second part is

271
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
that they

272
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,200
should also revalidate the delegation at

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
most

274
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,600
at the expiration of the ttl of the

275
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:50,480
parent side nsrr set

276
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,480
so uh you can move to the next slide

277
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
we pushed out a new revision of the

278
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,000
draft

279
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,719
i think a few weeks ago and i'll

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,320
summarize uh the main update so

281
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
i think all of these updates have been

282
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
discussed on the list or

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,680
at a previous itf meeting so there

284
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,719
shouldn't be anything really surprising

285
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,959
in there

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,200
so of course we renamed the document as

287
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,800
a working group doc it's

288
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
currently at revision00 we expanded the

289
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,519
motivation in the

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,200
intro section a bit we

291
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
made some minor adjustments to make the

292
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,560
revalidation

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,279
algorithm description fully compatible

294
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,959
with qna minimization

295
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:42,160
and for the discussion around the ds-ttl

296
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,359
we split that out into its own section

297
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:50,399
where we mentioned that although by spec

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,959
so specifically rfc 4035 section 2.4

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,639
the ds and the delegating nsttl are

300
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,800
supposed to match

301
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,800
in practice they often don't and

302
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,639
typically don't so one possible proposal

303
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,680
is that resolvers

304
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,839
should use the dsttl which is of course

305
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,800
signed as the revalidation interval

306
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,560
itself

307
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
so i think folks made this

308
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,599
recommendation in the past but i'm not

309
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,920
sure we had consensus on it so this

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,760
probably needs some more discussion

311
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,920
right now in the document we say

312
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,040
resolvers may that's uppercase may do it

313
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,199
so the question is should that be

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,360
promoted to should or

315
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,279
should something else be said or done

316
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,600
here so that's one of the questions that

317
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
we have

318
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,519
um and then if the entire ns set is

319
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
assessed to be lame

320
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
then the resolver should perform

321
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,040
revalidation of the parent

322
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
but with a hold down timer to avoid

323
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,000
inadvertently

324
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
spinning and inflicting a denial of

325
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,800
service loop at the parent zone

326
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,680
so we don't yet specify a value for the

327
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,760
hold down

328
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,359
and we probably should recommend

329
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,079
something here

330
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
so i think um

331
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
paul and some other folks have have an

332
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
idea what it should be but

333
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,479
that's maybe that should be something we

334
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,000
should collectively

335
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
discuss so let's move on to the next

336
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,720
slide system

337
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,120
there is a new section on optimizations

338
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,800
where we've added some of the

339
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
possibilities that have been discussed

340
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,479
previously on the list

341
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,239
and they are that resolvers can cache

342
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,480
whether authority servers are doing

343
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,279
minimal responses or not

344
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,360
and use that information to subsequently

345
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,600
forego the additional

346
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:45,199
child ns query for those that uh

347
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,240
that don't and secondly authoritative

348
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,439
servers that are

349
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,720
performing minimal responses could also

350
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,600
help out a bit

351
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,320
by selectively adding the authoritative

352
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,920
ns set

353
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,760
in their responses only for the dns

354
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,160
key queries so they're minimizing every

355
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,279
other response except for the dns

356
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,079
key query and this might allow resolvers

357
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,079
to

358
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,279
cache that information and similarly

359
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,719
forego the

360
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,880
additional child ns query for subsequent

361
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
interactions with that zone

362
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
so these are currently just mentioned as

363
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,360
possibilities without any strong

364
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,959
recommendations

365
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,399
either way so that's another open

366
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,719
question about how

367
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,920
strongly or not we want to recommend the

368
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
resolvers do these things

369
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,120
and lastly there's a new section on on

370
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,359
delegation changes so things like

371
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,440
uh removal of delegations and

372
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,639
redelegations of the zone to new name

373
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,120
servers

374
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,199
so this section says that if the

375
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,720
delegation has been removed

376
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,479
ideally the resolvers should prune

377
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
the cache at the delegation point as

378
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,120
specified in

379
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
rfc 80 20.

380
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,800
or if that can't be done allow cached

381
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
entries below

382
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,240
the zone cut to persist until they

383
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,360
expire

384
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
and if only a subset of ns servers have

385
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
been redelegated

386
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,319
then no cash cleanup is needed or or

387
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,320
desired

388
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,959
um next slide that may be the

389
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,160
the yeah right that's it okay yeah so

390
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,800
that that's basically it

391
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,719
that's a summary of what's changed in

392
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,839
the latest version of the draft and i'll

393
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,839
open it up for

394
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
discussion

395
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,160
comments questions recommendations for

396
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,160
how to resolve some of these issues

397
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,480
so um i still feel very strongly about

398
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,040
this

399
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
and i still don't think that we should

400
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,439
do this work as i said by the

401
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,959
when we had the call for adoption it is

402
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
wandering way too far

403
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,719
into implementation territory and it

404
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
forces away how

405
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,880
certain people think how the resolution

406
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
process works to be kind of implemented

407
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,680
by all resolvers

408
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,279
there are other ways to do

409
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,439
resolution and there's other ways to

410
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,199
handle delegation it also makes some

411
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
assumption that sort of the cash

412
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,719
that you have for records and for

413
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
delegations the same that's not always

414
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,920
the case

415
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,000
um and uh everything that we do

416
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,959
that causes outbound curies on a

417
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,839
resolver

418
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,319
will be abused and this is one thing

419
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,440
that certainly will be abused so

420
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,399
it is a i mean the the minimized

421
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
question also is something that really

422
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,040
even

423
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,758
if other resolvers would be authoritive

424
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,680
would send the stuff back

425
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,880
it depends on the result if he takes it

426
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,079
or not so

427
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,360
i think we're having some bad

428
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,719
assumptions or we are trying to

429
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,199
implement something

430
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,320
that might help one or two use cases

431
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,160
but that overall will kind of make the

432
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
way how resolvers over the internet

433
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,279
behave more consistent and more abusable

434
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,160
so i'm sort of very much still opposed

435
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,400
at work

436
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,079
yeah so i understand ralph your position

437
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,439
and i know some people disagree

438
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:19,839
but on balance uh the consensus went the

439
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,839
other way right

440
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,760
any other brian

441
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,440
hi um i'm not i'm sorry i was a little

442
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,879
bit late joining i wasn't sure

443
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,760
if any of this has uh taken into

444
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,039
consideration

445
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,720
some of the new uh things in ede

446
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,400
extended uh dns errors um

447
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,799
i know uh for sure like we at godaddy

448
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,480
have

449
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,760
implemented and are using uh the

450
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,440
uh non-authoritative extended error 20

451
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,520
and i think that might be useful and

452
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,400
helpful for

453
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,080
um anybody who wants or you know uh any

454
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,559
delegation check against

455
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
an authoritative server to find out if

456
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,200
it's lame

457
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,678
uh if you if the if the server you're

458
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
asking

459
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
thinks it's not authoritative that i

460
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,918
think is going to

461
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,320
dovetail very nicely into this anyway

462
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
that's

463
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,918
just an observation i don't know if it

464
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
was raised at all at any point

465
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,760
uh no it hasn't been discussed so can

466
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
you remind us what uh the extended error

467
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,600
code 20

468
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,799
uh is used for uh it basically says

469
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,639
it explains why you're giving an answer

470
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,200
that says refused

471
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,240
and it specifically says i'm refused

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,840
because i'm not authoritative

473
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
got it yeah um yeah i mean so certainly

474
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,320
resolvers could use this

475
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,639
information to uh determine

476
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,639
more precisely that uh that a delegated

477
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,320
server is lame right so

478
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,679
yes i think that would be a reasonable

479
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,480
thing to do

480
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,919
yeah uh because right now there's no

481
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
feedback loop to the

482
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,919
delegation parent if you're not

483
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,240
authoritative

484
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,200
uh there's no mechanism for you and

485
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,520
you're not uh

486
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,559
and you're not the registrar uh you have

487
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,039
no method

488
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,280
no channel back to say hey you know this

489
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,520
is broken

490
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,520
yeah i'm just swiping okay

491
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,320
okay paul you have your hand up i think

492
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,880
do

493
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,678
um as the note taker i would appreciate

494
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,280
if people

495
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,039
like either you tim would give full

496
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
names or people would use their names i

497
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,480
recognize

498
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,440
uh many people by their voices but not

499
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
everybody what if

500
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
not everyone's using their uh their

501
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,520
camera so

502
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,120
um do the equivalent of flashing your

503
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,520
name badge to me by at least

504
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,399
focally saying who you are thank you

505
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,160
okay next

506
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
yep good thank you paul that's a good

507
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,640
point and

508
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,639
zizago do you say

509
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,960
um there's one other person with their

510
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,559
microphone unmuted i wasn't sure if they

511
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,679
wanted to speak or not

512
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,200
um okay so i believe that's covered

513
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,480
everybody

514
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
so okay

515
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,240
good well thanks shimon i think that

516
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:18,000
that kind of covers it that was some

517
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,360
we're getting closer sort of thing

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,600
yes thank you thank you and certainly

519
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,199
um anybody who hasn't read this draft

520
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
lately and might have some opinions on

521
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,159
how to resolve these issues

522
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,280
go re-read it um and uh comment on the

523
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,840
mailing list please

524
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,399
because we do need the uh the input so

525
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,720
that

526
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,720
the authors can resolve those last open

527
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
issues

528
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
yes

529
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,799
okay so my presentation is uh

530
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:14,000
very brief in fact could you please

531
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,000
switch to the next slide

532
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:22,480
yep there you

533
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,480
go so

534
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,000
the draft is dedicated to

535
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,360
introducing uh actual uh

536
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,880
russian ghost standard to dennis sec

537
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,918
after a long discussion draft was

538
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,840
adopted

539
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,880
by the working group in summer

540
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:48,240
uh there were

541
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,760
uh two or three reviews

542
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,440
which did not

543
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,520
attach the text of the draft

544
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,320
significantly

545
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,039
and the the only point that was

546
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,240
clarified

547
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,320
is uh the relationship between the draft

548
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,320
and the rfc 5933

549
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:14,080
so the text of the document is

550
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,199
stable the

551
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:22,000
difference from rfc 5933 mostly

552
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
in the path of examples

553
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:30,000
we have an implementation it uh

554
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,880
i have an implementation in uh ldns

555
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,320
project

556
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,520
here at the link and uh well in fact

557
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,879
any open ssl based uh

558
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,240
dns tech implementation

559
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,520
can be easily extended

560
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,520
to implement the draft

561
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,678
also we have optimized the

562
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,559
open source implementation of the

563
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,039
elliptic curves

564
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,840
used in the draft so we in fact have

565
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,360
the speed comparable to the curve

566
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,799
255.19

567
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:16,799
oh well in this circumstances i think

568
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:20,000
it's time to ask for a group last call

569
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,280
if anybody is ready to review it again

570
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,840
of course

571
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,399
we'll take and take out the proper

572
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,600
changes

573
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,080
questions and recommendations but the

574
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,360
text

575
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,360
is stable enough

576
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,840
does not call much interest in fact

577
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,520
because ghost is a subject of

578
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:51,679
low interest outside of russia so

579
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,400
that's all thanks

580
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,400
okay peter

581
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,240
hello this is peter van dyke um

582
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,080
two questions two things one at

583
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,240
this very recent and wrestling pacific

584
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,240
i'm not sure we would implement

585
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,320
but if we would we would really like

586
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,720
some test vectors in the drafts can you

587
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,720
do that

588
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,760
there are test vectors in the uh

589
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,320
in the draft did i miss them

590
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:30,320
uh i think you did

591
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,480
let's see i see an example ds

592
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,360
and the example of the signal and

593
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,679
example of the k

594
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,678
and the signature our present too

595
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,158
okay well i will have another look then

596
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,200
thank you

597
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,159
not the problem at all you're right i

598
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,159
see it yeah thanks

599
00:24:48,400 --> 00:25:01,840
thanks jim

600
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,559
jim are you there yep

601
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,840
and we don't hear you sir

602
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,279
still not hearing jim oh he's

603
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,320
don't quite understand this in this uh

604
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,240
implementation

605
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,840
um just a question on the status of the

606
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,679
goss crypto code

607
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,879
is that widely deployed in things like

608
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,640
open ssl

609
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,640
and other crypto libraries

610
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,080
uh i

611
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,720
am actively participating in open

612
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,960
society

613
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,320
so ghost is of course implemented and

614
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,600
open society

615
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,080
i i'm aware of implementation

616
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,080
of this standard in

617
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,159
no talents and

618
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,320
most algorithms verification are

619
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:25,760
included

620
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:28,559
at least in linux kernel

621
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,559
okay thanks

622
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,918
okay

623
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,880
they're just paul this uh for the record

624
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,200
but um

625
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,039
i don't want to see this uh for working

626
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,240
group last call until we figure out

627
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:50,080
um this uh whether it would be uh

628
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,919
on standards tracker for informational

629
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,279
but we'll be talking about or i'll be

630
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,360
talking about that

631
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,640
in a few minutes in my draft um other

632
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,719
than that

633
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
i think it's fine that is technically it

634
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,880
seems fine i'm not an

635
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,480
implementer so i don't know whether

636
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,760
between this draft and

637
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,760
uh this draft and the rfc that describes

638
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,799
the actual signing algorithm if it's

639
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,879
implementable i

640
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,879
i sort of assume it is that you know

641
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,640
somebody who's not dimitri probably

642
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
could do it but it would be interesting

643
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,320
to hear from other people although

644
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,799
that's not really a requirement

645
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,760
but seriously the only thing i have on

646
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,279
this is

647
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,279
whether this would be for standards

648
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:29,760
track or not and i would say we should

649
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,480
wait before working group last call to

650
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
determine that

651
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
thanks

652
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,640
okay thanks dimitri

653
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:49,919
thank you i think

654
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:53,039
raise up um with another

655
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,039
good time for everybody

656
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,840
so right

657
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,840
there you are

658
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,240
good um good morning everybody hope i'm

659
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,679
clear

660
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
um first first off um thanks for uh

661
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,880
thanks to the adidas up working group

662
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,480
chairs for

663
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,240
number one adoption number two for

664
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,279
allowing me to talk a little bit about

665
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,960
this

666
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,279
um so i'll first talk about what

667
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,880
happened since it got adopted

668
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,080
and next slide please or can i do that

669
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,880
myself

670
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,399
no i i have it we've discovered

671
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
switching between speakers

672
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,678
and and controllers for the screen is a

673
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,720
little bit awkward so

674
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,720
we're doing we're just doing it

675
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,279
oh wonderful thank you suzanne so um

676
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
first off um i i hope nano recovers

677
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,760
quickly of course

678
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,679
um wish he was here um secondly

679
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,200
what changed since since the adoption

680
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,399
and well the

681
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,159
authors have changed and they became

682
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:00,158
editors instead of authors

683
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,440
that's the way i see it which means that

684
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,399
we live in the will of the

685
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,320
of the working group ed lewis who was

686
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,439
the very first author of the very first

687
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,320
draft

688
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,159
um decided to move on to bigger and

689
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,120
better things he's very very busy with

690
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,600
them

691
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,439
with them with other stuff and um and

692
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,639
and so i've asked some help from people

693
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,320
who offered

694
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,360
and number one joe abe um is a good

695
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,760
sense of of what is needed

696
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,320
very good technical writer as well and

697
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,279
then and additionally dr eberhard lister

698
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,678
dr iblis

699
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,480
is well known in the icann world and

700
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,520
he's part of the ccnso he's the ccnso

701
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,480
tech sorry he's the

702
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
tech working group chair um so he has he

703
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
has a

704
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,600
very good experience with um and all

705
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,840
things i can the way i see it

706
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,360
um so he's he's an editor of the draft

707
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,720
as well

708
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,879
um so just to recap what is the

709
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,480
uh draft aaron's private top-level

710
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,679
domain set at the time

711
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,120
designate iso 3166-1 alpha 2 user

712
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,320
assigned code elements as top-level

713
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,959
domains

714
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,678
so they can be used in it says but it

715
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,159
means in private space networks

716
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,960
um and so these elements are used like

717
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,799
um and i

718
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,399
i used as is by other status

719
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,639
organizations as well

720
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,840
and they're unlikely to be reassigned by

721
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,240
the iso and unlikely to be delegated by

722
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,918
icann

723
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,760
now keep in mind this was the draft that

724
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,360
was adopted at the time

725
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,520
so we had lots of discussions on the

726
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,360
list and they're basically the way i see

727
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,240
it and i'm sure that people line up with

728
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,678
my mic

729
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,679
to remind me of yet other things

730
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,360
and two main points of contention one is

731
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,720
private namespace is basically a bad

732
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,520
idea if you want to have something like

733
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,120
that use a registered name instead

734
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,158
and the other thing is namespace

735
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,678
policies are not ours to make

736
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,480
and that lies elsewhere all right um

737
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,480
next slide please

738
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,279
yeah sorry

739
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,399
no problem just multi-family yeah

740
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,200
thank you all right um so

741
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,479
um here's what the editors propose um to

742
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,360
the working group

743
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,519
um number one is reframe refrain from

744
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,199
discussing private names

745
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,960
or namespaces as solution for anything

746
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,120
i've realized that this is a big kind of

747
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,320
worms

748
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,799
and also if we need a document

749
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,799
that talks about the private namespace

750
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:35,039
problem space the concepts the purpose

751
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,600
the facilities the setup the need etc or

752
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,480
even the best current practice

753
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,199
around and i'm calling these independent

754
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,120
names

755
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,240
to avoid private namespace just for a

756
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,840
second

757
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,840
that's actually a different document

758
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,760
than this is

759
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,360
um what i said to the list the other day

760
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,519
is maybe we need two documents one

761
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,120
document that talks about private names

762
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,760
and another document that that proposed

763
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,719
what a private namespace could be

764
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,360
um so that's that's that's um one

765
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,960
proposal to the um to the working group

766
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
and the other proposal to the working

767
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,480
group is to change the tone slightly in

768
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,799
the document

769
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,320
um is to observe and recognize that

770
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,679
these iso 3166-1 alpha 2 user-assigned

771
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,240
code elements

772
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,919
are used as intended right by many

773
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,440
different organizations in many

774
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,519
different ways

775
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,519
and the intention from the iso has

776
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,799
always been locally defined and locally

777
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,840
meaningful

778
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:32,799
to those organizations that use them

779
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,360
excuse me another thing that we've come

780
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,639
across

781
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,158
is that these code elements

782
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,440
as top-level domains are actually used

783
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,480
in a while

784
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,559
and this has been cleared to us in the

785
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,200
dns magnitude study from alexander

786
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,918
maierhov

787
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,320
who's um who's also a participant here

788
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,799
in the

789
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,799
in the working group but alexander mayor

790
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,440
of has done a dns magnitude study which

791
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,440
he will

792
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,039
actually publish i hope uh next week

793
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,960
thursday at the center

794
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,559
um r d working group so that's not

795
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,679
available right now but

796
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,200
um i'm sure that that when when when he

797
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,720
releases it i will make the working

798
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,760
group aware of this

799
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,279
so these these um these iso

800
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,519
code elements are actually used

801
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,919
currently um so

802
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,640
with that in mind um next slide please

803
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,640
thank you suzanne

804
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,519
there we go and with that in mind

805
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,039
i'd like to um and this is actually a

806
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,960
proposal from joe

807
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,440
and then it's not the worst one i've

808
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,840
heard from him

809
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,600
so this is this is this is a proposal

810
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,000
from joe this is follow the spirit of

811
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,719
basically

812
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,919
obsoleting a code element in an iana

813
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,840
registry i i realized that this is

814
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,200
slightly different than actually

815
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,439
obsoleting your code element because we

816
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
are talking about main spaces here

817
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,919
but for instance if you look at our type

818
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,159
254

819
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,840
32769 opcode1 and edns option 4

820
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,679
etc etc those are code elements that

821
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,840
have been retired i want to avoid the

822
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,000
use of the term retired because

823
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,519
retiring a topic of domain has a

824
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,760
different connotation for instance in

825
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,800
the ccnso working group

826
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,040
sorry in the ccnso icann workspace

827
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,560
so that's why i named it obsoleting and

828
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,239
i think that's the correct term to use

829
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,320
here

830
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,918
well that implies actually the spirit of

831
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,599
obsoleting that these code elements

832
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,279
cannot be considered

833
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,639
as potential top-level domains in the

834
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
root zone

835
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,560
and i know i'm stepping on policy toes

836
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
here and this is not

837
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,639
actually i think this is not an explicit

838
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,399
policy that we can make

839
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,119
unless we use something like rc 6761

840
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,159
but it does follow the iso's intent and

841
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,159
the policy

842
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,480
that was is one of the founding

843
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,800
documents of the way i see it

844
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,399
i can um rc 51 sorry iona

845
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,920
5191 for 1591.

846
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,400
um so with these um let's call them baby

847
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,720
steps

848
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,680
um going forward on them on the tone of

849
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,359
the draft

850
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,359
i would like to um i would like to hand

851
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,560
the microphone back to suzanne

852
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,640
and if if um if

853
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,560
people want to ask questions i'm i'm i'm

854
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,359
here for it joe is here as well

everyone

857
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:25,759
thanks rory it looks like ted is

858
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,759
in the queue where was he

859
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,400
cody thanks very much for uh laying out

860
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,759
the draft uh roy

861
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
i had a chance to read it a couple of

862
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,960
weeks ago and and i confess that uh some

863
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,839
of what you've

864
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,280
uh put forward um in today's meeting

865
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,400
kind of echoes some of the things i was

866
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,400
thinking about it

867
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,079
uh in particular you you mentioned a

868
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,680
possibility of splitting the draft into

869
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,119
two things one of which talked about

870
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,759
private use names

871
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,040
uh and had that whole can of worm and

872
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,440
one of which talked about this

873
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,640
particular set of um

874
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,040
uh names and i i like that idea

875
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,920
for two reasons one i think it is

876
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,000
absolutely

877
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,320
required to get a good use of what that

878
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,320
sort of locally significant means

879
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,000
uh when we're talking about the dns and

880
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,960
and not in terms of the other

881
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,960
ways in which iso may have meant that

882
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,160
when setting these aside

883
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,320
and the second is i kind of feel like

884
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,399
we're that that document that's talking

885
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,160
about these specific names

886
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,839
should actually be an iso document

887
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,078
talking to icann not an itf document

888
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,040
and i think it would be valuable but i

889
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
don't think it

890
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,079
it actually comes from us because what

891
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,200
the

892
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:41,280
this document is trying to do is to to

893
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,560
to go from uh iso being unlikely to

894
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,040
reuse those

895
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,078
to making it essentially impossible and

896
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,160
because this is

897
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,599
uh something that that is really kind of

898
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,920
their bailiwick

899
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,520
uh i would be very happy if they said we

900
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,640
will make this impossible and

901
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,359
and therefore this we confirm to you i

902
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,400
can

903
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,880
that this usage of of these names uh is

904
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,160
confident with our policy and intent

905
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:10,079
um but i'm i'm somewhat concerned

906
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,759
that without iso saying that to icann

907
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:18,079
the itf saying it to icann based on some

908
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:22,480
possibly uh renewed sorry revisable

909
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,040
policy of isos is is not right and um

910
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,839
so it was i was wondering you know have

911
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,079
you guys talked

912
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,160
to iso about this would they be ready to

913
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,960
send such a document to i can

914
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,240
um and uh if they were not ready to send

915
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:51,839
such a document i can

916
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:51,839
what were their objections thanks

917
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,280
how this works you're good

918
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
very good well um so the idea with this

919
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,520
was i i get the point that this is a

920
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,520
potentially a very policy minefield that

921
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,960
we're wandering into in this document

922
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,400
and so first of all the study in the

923
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,320
documents was really identifying there's

924
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,839
two orthogonal cans of worms here let's

925
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,599
have separate cans

926
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,759
because they're different kinds of worms

927
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,800
and i i i do think that's a good idea

928
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,079
and it's good to hear

929
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,440
support for that the the the can that

930
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,160
contains the

931
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,000
two leather codes the idea really was to

932
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,480
try and limit the scope

933
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,920
of the discussion in the itf to just the

934
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,200
things that the ietf had something to

935
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,280
say about

936
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,359
which we thought was just the fact we

937
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,640
have code points we have the dns we have

938
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,480
elements of all of this that are very

939
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,160
much itf territory and we have an

940
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,440
observation that these things have been

941
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,279
used before

942
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,640
and that we can effectively expect name

943
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,119
collisions if these things were to

944
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,400
appear

945
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,359
actually in the root zone because we

946
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,640
know they're being used for other

947
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,078
purposes

948
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,759
so it was really the purpose of it was

949
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,720
really to document that

950
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,320
and the the hook that we have and the

951
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,759
tradition that we have in the ietf is to

952
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,760
take code points that have been used for

953
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,040
some reason in the past

954
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,480
and note that they've been used in the

955
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,599
past and note there might be a conflict

956
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,880
from using them in the future for a

957
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,119
particular purpose and this is why we

958
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,119
don't have an ipv5

959
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,640
so the idea of all of this was really to

960
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,560
limit the scope to just the stuff that

961
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,078
the ietf has something to say about

962
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,599
and not anything else and in particular

963
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,359
by basing it on

964
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,720
an observation of what's happened based

965
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,520
on historic

966
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,439
3166 policy and historic operational

967
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,800
behavior that's based on that

968
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,240
we don't actually need to link in the

969
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,680
future all we need to do is make the

970
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,040
observation this has happened in the

971
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,759
past and because it's happened in the

972
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,839
past

973
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
this constrains our users

974
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,160
oh sorry about that go ahead joe

975
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,839
my microphone wasn't working for you so

976
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,839
go ahead

977
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
joe you're still up

978
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,640
do i have to d up

979
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,240
i have nothing else to say okay

980
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,720
sorry guys can i just add one one one

981
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,279
more thing to what that said

982
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,160
um with regards to the um i didn't i

983
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,119
didn't fully hear

984
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,839
um joe's response because my um my

985
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
headset

986
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,240
was paying up all right i admit my

987
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,160
battery died but anyway

988
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,560
so um regards to iso um icam

989
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,440
and itf i think if i if i look at this

990
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,520
venn diagram

991
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,079
i think the iso has already said since

992
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,680
the inception of the standard 3166

993
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,720
that these names um are um are reserved

994
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,240
locally and um and that organizations

995
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:04,560
can use them in their own way um i i can

996
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:08,399
um has basically followed rc 1591

997
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,000
on this adopting um the iso's policy

998
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,079
now that doesn't explicitly mean that

999
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,760
these strings can be used

1000
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,280
um but i think if you look at this as a

1001
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,040
venn diagram

1002
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,800
um there needs to be an overlap between

1003
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,160
i can itf and iso

1004
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,520
where all three um explicitly say that

1005
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,240
yes these can be used for um

1006
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,400
something local and and i think the iso

1007
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,479
has done that the icann

1008
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,440
is busy with it they also need to answer

1009
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,040
to assec

1010
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,520
113 i can board and then and i think

1011
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,400
that the itf in itself also needs to

1012
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,000
needs to do that

1013
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,160
and that's what this draft is trying to

1014
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
do

1015
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,800
okay so brian

1016
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,280
just to kind of put a different

1017
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,480
viewpoint on it is

1018
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,720
i think what what the document's saying

1019
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,359
and what reality says is

1020
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,319
i can say two letters that space belongs

1021
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,680
to iso

1022
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,279
iso says these names are not used

1023
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,279
and will never be used for anything real

1024
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,720
and all we need to do from an ietf

1025
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,760
perspective is say

1026
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,560
uh ietf is not going to do anything with

1027
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,839
these

1028
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,560
per se so everybody's in agreement that

1029
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,759
this is

1030
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,599
space that is never going to be used um

1031
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,359
from the perspective of what's already

1032
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,280
been said i don't think

1033
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,839
anything much more than that needs to be

1034
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,599
actually said

1035
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:43,440
um so can i respond to that really quick

1036
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,480
um i i completely agree

1037
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,079
but there are some folks and i don't

1038
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,440
disagree with them there are some folks

1039
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,880
that said that's that's all good that

1040
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,480
all these organizations have these good

1041
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,440
intentions

1042
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,160
um but let's make it explicit because we

1043
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,400
don't know what

1044
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,440
these organizations will do in the

1045
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,720
future

1046
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,079
and so um and so there are folks that

1047
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,520
agree with you and there are folks that

1048
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,880
want a little bit more

1049
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,759
than just agree with you they want

1050
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,760
something explicit

1051
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:14,960
cool thanks ray warren

1052
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,920
thank you warren tomorrow um

1053
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,119
so both roy and joe mentioned policy

1054
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,720
invitations

1055
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,760
um and i think roy also mentioned um

1056
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,040
slack on 13. um just

1057
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,800
know um euron the

1058
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,480
ceo of icann um sent over a liaison

1059
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,200
statement a while ago

1060
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,640
um i will paste the link to it um

1061
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,240
largely saying you know

1062
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,359
we have this document from from ikansak

1063
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,759
saying that um you know

1064
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,759
possibly recommending that a name should

1065
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,480
be reserved

1066
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,520
and then a response from the ietf or

1067
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,440
actually sorry from the iab

1068
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,640
and iesg largely saying

1069
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,000
yes we agree with what you said um i'll

1070
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,319
actually put the whole text and it makes

1071
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,119
much more sense um but the important

1072
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,359
thing at the bottom

1073
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,680
is we think it would be useful to engage

1074
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,200
ietf and icann experts in a dialogue on

1075
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,879
this topic and we'll follow up to try

1076
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,160
and get that arranged

1077
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,880
and that's mainly referring to

1078
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,720
the special use names problem statement

1079
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,760
and the sort of lack of clarity

1080
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:35,439
that we all know exists in um

1081
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,400
6761 and sort of who does which bits etc

1082
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,480
so i figured i would mention that and as

1083
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,560
i say i will put links to the

1084
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,160
letter from euron and the liaison

1085
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,520
response

1086
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,598
none of which is surprising the

1087
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,960
questions were i think very reasonable

1088
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,560
and the response

1089
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,560
largely sort of nods and agrees

1090
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:05,839
thanks warren jim

1091
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,839
are you muted again jim

1092
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:47,839
still not hearing jim

1093
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,319
you want to go ahead in the queue one

1094
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,480
time we're um

1095
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,560
we're probably close but yeah we should

1096
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,599
close the microphone yeah we'll close it

1097
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,880
after stewart

1098
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,880
so mr hardy

1099
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
to joe and to roy for continuing to be

1100
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,839
so careful in their explanations of

1101
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,400
what's going on

1102
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,839
here i i do however feel like they're

1103
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
they're two pieces of this so we still

1104
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,160
need to be

1105
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,839
more careful about than the draft is

1106
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,759
right now and and

1107
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,040
one is there's a very serious

1108
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,000
distinction between

1109
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,480
isis intent uh to say that these these

1110
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,520
are

1111
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,599
reserved and we don't uh we don't intend

1112
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:35,680
to use them as country names

1113
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,720
um but they may be used for other things

1114
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,759
uh and

1115
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,160
the the conclusion that they um

1116
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,560
should be used in in private used dns in

1117
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,560
the way that scrapped imagine so i think

1118
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,599
uh joe asked in the in the chat what

1119
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,799
should zero

1120
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,680
one say i think uh as before

1121
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:54,000
the the right thing to do is uh to take

1122
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,799
up

1123
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,200
you know what what does it mean to have

1124
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,440
this

1125
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,240
this style of name in one document so

1126
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,400
split that

1127
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,240
that out and then the other one uh to go

1128
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,319
back to what roy was saying to say

1129
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,160
these are being squatted on and to say

1130
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,480
flat out not that we recommend you do

1131
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,720
that

1132
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,880
not that we think it ought to happen but

1133
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,520
that we observe in the wild that this

1134
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,880
is happening um and if you say that i

1135
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,200
think it's uncontroversial

1136
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,079
you probably have data to back it up um

1137
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,919
and with that

1138
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,520
you're not making a recommendation that

1139
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,720
they be treated according to any

1140
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,720
particular

1141
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,799
future use you go back to what roy was

1142
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,000
saying this is what we've seen

1143
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,160
in uh in in the wild

1144
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,480
and i think that allows you to to go

1145
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,759
after you've developed the the document

1146
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,680
you split out

1147
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,839
back into that policy process and say

1148
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,399
hey now we think we have a good idea of

1149
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,520
what these

1150
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:52,240
can be used for um as

1151
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,480
uh a non-general purpose

1152
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,439
dns names but as these kind of

1153
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,079
particular clash of special use names

1154
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,280
and that allows you to make sure that

1155
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,000
iso and ican

1156
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,920
and the ietf are in fact all in

1157
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,880
agreement on that particular use of

1158
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,559
these names

1159
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,559
i i think at the moment relying on iso

1160
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,760
having said that these are reserved and

1161
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,040
seeing them in the wild

1162
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,480
and drawing the conclusion that

1163
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,319
therefore they can be used in the way

1164
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:24,079
that they are in the wild is

1165
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,880
is probably not not as clean as i would

1166
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,760
like it to be

1167
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,240
and i i think splitting it out and and

1168
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,839
shifting that tone would help a lot

1169
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,839
uh thanks very much

1170
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,319
thanks ted ever heard

1171
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,800
good morning can you hear me yes

1172
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,119
yes okay um this is my first um iits

1173
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,400
meeting so be a bear with me

1174
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,839
i'm an actual newbie in these things

1175
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,839
i have been vice chairing the retirement

1176
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:02,078
policy development group at ccnso

1177
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,480
what would happen if a country ceases to

1178
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:07,599
exist or something or splits apart

1179
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,599
that has led me to do really detailed

1180
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,960
study of the iso

1181
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:16,240
standard which has recently been been

1182
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,240
written in the beginning of this process

1183
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,200
of this particular document i was a bit

1184
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,399
concerned

1185
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,558
but i've changed my mind because and and

1186
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,720
it is very helpful what has been said to

1187
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,880
from by several participants to split

1188
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,359
this into two

1189
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,920
the iso which is the un type

1190
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,880
organization that meets occasionally

1191
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,559
and it's not really that predictable has

1192
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,400
been predictable

1193
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:45,920
in that it says there are

1194
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,240
a certain number of code elements to

1195
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,760
character code elements that are not

1196
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,680
part of the standard

1197
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,920
they're not reserved they're not part of

1198
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,359
the standard

1199
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,640
the and then there is a list of

1200
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:04,160
32 or something the point

1201
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,400
is that there will always be um

1202
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,040
two letter code elements that are not

1203
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,400
part of the standard they are reserved

1204
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,558
in quotes for for um for

1205
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,640
because there are entities that need

1206
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,599
those to do things and

1207
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,440
they even reflect this in the new um

1208
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,240
standard in the in the bibliography

1209
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,079
where they say

1210
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,118
these are users where this is being used

1211
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,880
for in the same bibliography they also

1212
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,480
mention

1213
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:36,480
ayana function the public term

1214
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,599
technical identifiers and so on so

1215
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,960
my view is that it will never happen

1216
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:46,800
that they do away with all of them and

1217
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:50,400
it is um extremely unlikely

1218
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,520
um it's much less likely than a plane

1219
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,520
flies on the hou

1220
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,040
lands in the house that i'm living in at

1221
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,440
the moment

1222
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,200
that any one of the ones that are

1223
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,920
currently there are being changed

1224
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,919
i don't don't see this ever happening i

1225
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,720
don't know whether this is good enough

1226
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,760
engineering standard but i would for my

1227
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,240
own personal belief i would think so

1228
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,240
so it does make sense to split this into

1229
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,279
in into two parts

1230
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,879
and um say um

1231
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,720
the ones that are unassigned

1232
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,359
should never form part of the route and

1233
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,680
then one can look at

1234
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,558
the ones which ones are unassigned in a

1235
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,879
separate document

1236
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,880
thanks

1237
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,839
stuart

1238
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:45,040
hey can you hear me yes yes good

1239
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,599
um i added myself to the queue just

1240
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,759
because i

1241
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,079
heard a comment and i didn't catch who

1242
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,839
was speaking

1243
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,359
and if i heard it right the comment was

1244
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,640
along the lines that

1245
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,078
um there are certain codes that iso said

1246
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,200
they won't use

1247
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,800
and icann says they won't use

1248
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:06,078
and the idf should say that we won't

1249
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,119
define anything about that

1250
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:12,880
either and they're free for local use

1251
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,440
and the problem with that is

1252
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,359
whenever you say something is reserved

1253
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,960
inevitably a whole bunch of people leap

1254
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,400
forward and think that means it's

1255
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:22,720
reserved for them

1256
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,240
um i've even thought about writing a

1257
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,879
draft with the title

1258
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,759
this field is reserved but not for you

1259
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,520
um

1260
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,079
the problem is if you don't say who it's

1261
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:36,160
reserved for then

1262
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:39,760
uh my isps might decide to use

1263
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,640
dot z for their private stuff

1264
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,720
and i might buy a bunch of ip based home

1265
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:46,640
automation technology that in my home

1266
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,558
says we can use dot cc because it's

1267
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,078
reserved for local use and

1268
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,280
my company uses zz and i connect over

1269
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,800
vpn

1270
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,040
and now we've got three different local

1271
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,400
uses that conflict

1272
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:02,880
so my comment is

1273
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,440
it can often seem very tempting to just

1274
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,160
say

1275
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,960
this is reserved do what you like but i

1276
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,879
think

1277
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,480
the ietf is abdicating its

1278
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,880
responsibility

1279
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,480
if it says that because then you get

1280
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,040
conflicting uses

1281
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,599
and the mission statement to the ietf is

1282
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,079
to

1283
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,119
help maintain a well-functioning

1284
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,319
internet

1285
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,400
so i think we can't abdicate that

1286
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,200
responsibility if something is reserved

1287
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,880
for a purpose

1288
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,960
we need to be very clear what purpose

1289
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,720
it's reserved for

1290
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:37,760
that's it okay

1291
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,959
thanks jim do you want to try again

1292
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,480
and then warren had the last word is

1293
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
this working for me now

1294
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,839
yes it is excellent sorry guys it's far

1295
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,040
too early in the morning for me

1296
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:52,558
um my comment relates to the text in

1297
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,160
section four of the document

1298
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,760
roy's got a comprehensive fairly

1299
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,839
comprehensive list

1300
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,680
of all the different organizations and

1301
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:00,078
agencies that are doing things with

1302
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,480
these

1303
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:06,160
special purpose iso 3166 codes

1304
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,800
i think this material is inappropriate

1305
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:12,240
for an rsc because it's not up to the

1306
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,960
itf to document what the international

1307
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,759
salvation

1308
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,559
organization or the world bank chooses

1309
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,319
to do

1310
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,680
i think that's completely inappropriate

1311
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:21,599
and of course

1312
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,200
those organizations behavior and

1313
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,520
policies could change so

1314
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,720
maybe they're using.xml today but maybe

1315
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,280
they'll change the use

1316
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,520
dot xu tomorrow so i don't think this

1317
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,800
material is relevant to analysis useful

1318
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,839
background information

1319
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,839
but i don't think it's at all

1320
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:40,000
appropriate to go into an rsc

1321
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:43,119
thanks um jim this is this is roy

1322
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,760
um i i i think you're right so

1323
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,960
um what i'm going to propose is to move

1324
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,760
that section

1325
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,200
um to an appendix and basically say at

1326
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,040
the time of writing

1327
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,720
there's an example this is a

1328
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,240
non-normative

1329
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,078
list et cetera et cetera all the other

1330
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,759
um all the stuff there to just make this

1331
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,680
anecdotal um

1332
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,640
and not part of this part of the the

1333
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,319
actual content of the document

1334
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,920
yeah thanks ryan i think you could only

1335
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,680
use one or two examples i don't think

1336
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,040
you need to enumerate everything

1337
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,040
in that appendix cheers yeah all right

1338
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,119
okay warren and brian we've closed the

1339
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,680
queue so warren's got the last word is

1340
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,480
a.d

1341
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,598
basically sorry about that thank you

1342
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,720
i'll try to keep it short

1343
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,680
um so i think that um ted and stuart

1344
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,319
kind of

1345
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,040
hit the nail on where my concern with

1346
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,119
this is

1347
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,480
um throughout the presentation people

1348
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,559
have said things like you know it's

1349
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,079
extremely unlikely that these would ever

1350
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,079
be

1351
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,520
taken off the reserve list and used for

1352
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,520
something else

1353
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,319
and so that's where my concern is

1354
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,200
if iso were ever to try and say you know

1355
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:51,599
dot zed

1356
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,879
is now going to be reassigned for

1357
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,319
zanzibar

1358
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,960
um unlike with many other users

1359
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,799
if we started using it in the dns that

1360
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,480
really makes it very hard

1361
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,160
for the because of these sort of

1362
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,200
uncoordinated use of this

1363
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:08,160
it makes it really hard to take it out

1364
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,279
of that

1365
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,598
um once people start using got7 for

1366
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,319
whatever internal use you can't figure

1367
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,079
out where it is

1368
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,759
you can't remove it basically the name

1369
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,040
collisions problem

1370
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,480
um if we had something from iso

1371
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,520
saying no seriously these ones that

1372
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,440
we're saying

1373
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:28,640
you can use internally for private type

1374
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,640
stuff

1375
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:33,118
you can use them no worries we will

1376
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:33,759
never never reassign them for anything

1377
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,079
else

1378
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,680
then i think this is a grand idea my

1379
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,880
concern constantly

1380
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:42,720
what happens when iso tries to use it

1381
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,839
and then the ietf has to say

1382
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,879
oh sorry uh we trusted your earlier

1383
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:50,558
document

1384
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:54,000
and um now you kinda can't do that

1385
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,000
hopefully that wasn't true rambling

1386
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,680
it does give you the last word warren

1387
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,160
and we will continue the discussion on

1388
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,960
the list

1389
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,960
of how this

1390
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,240
should be moved forward

1391
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,119
and i guess we should go

1392
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,119
on to the next

1393
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,960
who is our next presenter

1394
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,520
mr fujiwara-san with the um avoid

1395
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,839
fragmentation

1396
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,839
yes now we'll be up just in a moment

1397
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,079
there we go

1398
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,839
okay please go ahead i'll tell you here

1399
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:42,000
me

1400
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:45,279
yes okay this is cosmo refuge

1401
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,240
from jprs i will talk about directory

1402
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,520
distinct super body fragmentation

1403
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:53,279
fragmentation of dancing dna x-ray

1404
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,559
speeds

1405
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,520
there you go these are updates from

1406
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,640
previous

1407
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,640
idf meetings

1408
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,160
who also submitted

1409
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:13,280
this september 15th

1410
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:15,680
different differences here and

1411
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,760
these are different things from previous

1412
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,960
version

1413
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,920
we simplified recommendations in section

1414
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,640
3

1415
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,680
detailed details are described in next

1416
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,279
slide

1417
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,839
and we added text in section 4

1418
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,599
default proximity value for iv button

1419
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,640
voice

1420
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:39,760
x66 default value for algebra

1421
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,640
is x866 discussion

1422
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,160
here will be deleted when the discussion

1423
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:51,839
is over

1424
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:51,839
next right

1425
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:58,399
these are current recommendations

1426
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,839
section 3.2 recommendations for udp

1427
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,040
responders

1428
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,759
udp responders should send dnc responses

1429
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:08,000
with

1430
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:12,000
ip don't log ip16 clock options

1431
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,520
udp responders main probe to discover

1432
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:19,119
the real empty value for destination

1433
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:22,000
gtps 1.6 gdp responses

1434
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,200
that result in id packets that do not

1435
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,079
exceed

1436
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,279
the percent due to the distance to the

1437
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,400
requester

1438
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,599
of course as in the conventional case a

1439
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,880
special

1440
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:38,880
aspect a specified barrier for example

1441
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:43,119
1220 or 1232

1442
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:46,240
as the dns pakistani limit may be used

1443
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:49,599
and in section 3.2

1444
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:52,558
recommendations for udp requesters

1445
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,520
usb requesters should send dns responses

1446
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,680
with

1447
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:01,119
ip don't collect ipv6 control options

1448
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:03,839
udp requesters should use the requestors

1449
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,880
payroll sites to limit the percent fuel

1450
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:08,480
value

1451
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:12,000
minus the ip header lengths

1452
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,880
and udp header lengths and limited

1453
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,559
resistors

1454
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:19,440
may drop fragmented dncd responses

1455
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:21,200
without ipd assembly to avoid just

1456
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:28,559
pointed attacks

1457
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:32,078
extract breeds

1458
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:36,480
please deviant comment and

1459
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:41,359
my eye and there are my idea to upgrade

1460
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,359
i will discuss with co-author and

1461
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,040
we will submit new next version as soon

1462
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:51,920
as possible

1463
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,920
i'd like to add

1464
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,000
text to about package trust at udp

1465
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,760
response

1466
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,160
responder i'd like to add text if the

1467
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,599
if the udp responder detects immediate

1468
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,040
error

1469
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:09,599
that the udp packet cannot be sent

1470
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,640
beyond the possibility size e-message

1471
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:14,319
sites

1472
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:17,200
the udp responder may create responses

1473
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,920
response packets hitting possibility

1474
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,399
size or

1475
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:25,680
tcp set and i'd like to change

1476
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,799
priority first ip don't worry

1477
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,879
second avoid packet draw

1478
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:32,400
then i would like to add existing

1479
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,280
interrupt introduction

1480
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,960
this document proposes to set ip don't

1481
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:40,720
drop

1482
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:43,280
ip160 in dns udp responses

1483
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,799
in order to avoid active fragmentation

1484
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,480
and describes how to

1485
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,799
avoid bucket losses due to ip don't

1486
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,599
drive

1487
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:54,400
i even just don't clap and i'd like to

1488
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,400
change order

1489
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,400
first section 3.3 recommendations for

1490
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:01,920
responders

1491
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:04,720
and second recommendations for

1492
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,720
requestors

1493
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,640
that's how you got gold

1494
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,479
thank you for joining son and any

1495
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,680
comments on this this docu this document

1496
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,839
feels like it's been through a great

1497
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,680
deal of discussion and

1498
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:27,680
good solid work in the working group so

1499
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,680
um curious where people can get that

1500
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,839
warren was that an old hand

1501
01:02:38,559 --> 01:03:03,839
go ahead mark

1502
01:02:48,240 --> 01:03:03,839
you may be muted

1503
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,799
still not hearing

1504
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:14,880
mark because uh it asks for the mission

1505
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:17,920
uh what that what the anyway

1506
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,240
this document doesn't talk about tc at

1507
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,599
all

1508
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:25,359
in terms of recovery and how to

1509
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:29,119
behave when you're using tcg because tc

1510
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:33,359
completely prevents reassembly attacks

1511
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:37,119
succeeding you one has a different

1512
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:40,000
there's a different need in terms

1513
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,880
of whether you allow fragmentation to

1514
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,200
occur or not

1515
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:48,079
when you're sending a tcg reply

1516
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,720
the tcg replies you can fragment as much

1517
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:54,240
as you want

1518
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:57,680
and there's no reassembly attack

1519
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:59,279
that can successfully deliver the dns

1520
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:03,680
packet

1521
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,680
dnsudb packet which we misinterpreted

1522
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,400
i do have enough do have the well-known

1523
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:15,680
graph which we also

1524
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:18,799
as a way of making

1525
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:23,279
as as a way of

1526
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:27,680
extending dns without

1527
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:30,240
without um

1528
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,839
but i haven't require requiring dns sec

1529
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,959
to prevent

1530
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:37,038
um path attacks

1531
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,200
including off path reassembly attacks

1532
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,319
succeeding

1533
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:45,919
um so

1534
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:47,279
this needs issue this document should a

1535
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,200
very minimum

1536
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:54,000
take into consideration t6 signed

1537
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,279
responses to tc signed requests in a

1538
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,839
different manner

1539
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,839
to non-tc signed requests

1540
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:09,839
does that make sense

1541
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:28,000
see do you mean you are well known

1542
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,000
this is a key idea

1543
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:37,280
tc prevents reassembly attacks

1544
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:40,400
it also prevents uh

1545
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:43,599
referrals being a path

1546
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,119
referral of past birthing of referral

1547
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,319
succeeding

1548
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:50,240
providing both the both

1549
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,799
both sides of the communication doing

1550
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,799
tcig

1551
01:05:53,520 --> 01:06:01,520
at the moment this draft

1552
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:05,280
has no does not use the word tcg at all

1553
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:07,038
anywhere in it and the way you reply to

1554
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,400
a statistic message

1555
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:19,359
should be different to the way you reply

1556
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:22,480
to a non-tc message

1557
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:25,520
i think i think

1558
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,400
we're noticing your well-known tcp idea

1559
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,119
is

1560
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:31,119
another good idea and

1561
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:39,520
yeah but they they interact with one

1562
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,640
another

1563
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,280
yeah because if you if if you're

1564
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,440
dealing only with plain udp and no

1565
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,880
crypto over the top of it

1566
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,559
you have a difference you have a

1567
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:55,039
different problem space

1568
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:55,039
than udp with crypto at the top of it

1569
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,520
mark do you can you suggest text maybe

1570
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:05,680
to the list

1571
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:09,200
i can try i can try

1572
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:11,839
um you would have also seen i presume

1573
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:15,038
you also saw my call for adoption of the

1574
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:18,319
other the uh the well-known one

1575
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:19,920
um suzanne but yeah

1576
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:28,079
i'll leave that what leave that with the

1577
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:31,760
chairs for that one

1578
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:31,760
and who was next to

1579
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:46,000
ralph i guess who's next yes

1580
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:52,799
um so t-seg curies are

1581
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,280
only a smart small part of sort of the

1582
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,319
old

1583
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,119
overall dns traffic and i don't think

1584
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,520
that we'll see

1585
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,640
more adoption but the other main problem

1586
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,759
is that

1587
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:06,960
fragmentation within ipv6 is

1588
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,599
from what i've heard just not working so

1589
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,839
rather than to kind of make one

1590
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,039
additional kind of special use case yeah

1591
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,839
we can do

1592
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,199
fragmentation with t6 over v4 but we

1593
01:08:15,839 --> 01:08:19,759
can't do it over six

1594
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,120
i think what fujiwara proposes much

1595
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,839
better i mean have a

1596
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,839
clear guidance if you want to run dns

1597
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:30,000
you don't fragment period

1598
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:30,000
end of story um

1599
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:37,678
i keep hearing that

1600
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,000
fragmentation over ipv6 doesn't work but

1601
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:39,920
if you

1602
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,279
turn off your local file if you actually

1603
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,799
let fragments through your local

1604
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:46,319
firewall they get delivered

1605
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,319
they get delivered reliably

1606
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,880
and

1607
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,279
ipv6 is still very much in an early

1608
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:58,559
adopter stage

1609
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:01,839
where people are still paranoid to the

1610
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:05,679
really paranoid ipv6

1611
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:10,318
has a 32-bit fragmentation reassembly id

1612
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:12,640
which was designed specifically to avoid

1613
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:16,719
designed specifically to defeat

1614
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:21,040
fragmentation reassembly attacks

1615
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:23,439
i find it absolutely ludicrous

1616
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,319
that we can't send fragments over ipv6

1617
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,238
we we're

1618
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,080
we're saying don't send fragments over

1619
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,479
ipv6

1620
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:32,238
when ipv6 is designed to avoid the

1621
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:35,358
attacks

1622
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:37,358
but then fragment but because of other

1623
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,279
cartridges in the protocol like

1624
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,400
extension editors nobody's actually

1625
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:44,880
paying attention so everybody has their

1626
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,559
firewalls turned off to well dropped

1627
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,600
fragments

1628
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,839
there's a difference between the

1629
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:53,040
fragment and then extension header

1630
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:55,920
and the fragmentation handler

1631
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,920
fry there is a there really is a

1632
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,480
difference

1633
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,920
and they all people keep lumping the two

1634
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,639
lumping the two

1635
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:07,679
two things together when they are

1636
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,679
absolutely different

1637
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:17,199
people do studies to say reassembly of

1638
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:19,840
extensions don't work

1639
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:22,000
and that's so self-def it ends up being

1640
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,640
self

1641
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:31,840
a self-fulfilling prophecy if you don't

1642
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,840
send them they won't work

1643
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,199
if you actually send said fragments

1644
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,640
through the core of the network as a

1645
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:41,839
responses

1646
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,960
they get like they get there if you let

1647
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,800
them in

1648
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,000
okay i think this sounds like it needs

1649
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,320
to go to the list and be

1650
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,640
sort of worked out there but i

1651
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:53,519
appreciate the

1652
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,280
energy going on there so let's say we

1653
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,440
move on to peter and then close it

1654
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:00,880
close the queue after joe

1655
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,280
well this is peter van dyke at

1656
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,000
powerdinos over the last two years

1657
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,519
several but not all dns vendors have

1658
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,679
come together to

1659
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,560
somewhat solve fragmentation problem as

1660
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,280
well

1661
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,480
by agreeing on a default buff size in a

1662
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,719
configuration of 1232 bytes

1663
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:19,919
this document plainly states that that

1664
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,080
was wrong

1665
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,760
i think that that is divisive and i do

1666
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:27,840
not think that that text

1667
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,840
belongs in an rfc

1668
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,040
thanks peter thank you

1669
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,800
mr joe put my hand up just as you said

1670
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,919
that the fragmentation conversation

1671
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,960
should go to the list

1672
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,960
so i will talk there

1673
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,440
okay there's lots of moving parts in

1674
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:57,280
that fragmentation discussion so

1675
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,280
i think it needs to be fleshed out in

1676
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,880
text

1677
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:05,519
so thanks all

1678
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,880
and and thank you mr fujiwha son so we

1679
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,719
will

1680
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:12,080
continue on this one and hopefully sort

1681
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:12,080
of get to some more consensus

1682
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,799
i believe it's menu up next

1683
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,960
i believe no that's not the one

1684
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,960
we've already been through that one

1685
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,880
ayanna considerations i believe that's

1686
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,880
mr hoffman

1687
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,719
yes it is i'm sorry yeah sorry manu i

1688
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,080
was

1689
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:44,080
looking at looking at my list

1690
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,080
incorrectly thank you go ahead mr paul

1691
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,839
and you're muted

1692
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:19,840
still can't hear you sir

1693
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:32,880
all right can you hear me now yes

1694
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:32,879
yes let's

1695
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:39,440
um so uh

1696
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,799
this document which is proposed for the

1697
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:43,759
working group um

1698
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,159
has is just one very small change and it

1699
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,679
is

1700
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:50,480
um motivated by dimitri's talk earlier

1701
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,480
so next slide

1702
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,600
so right now we have

1703
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,679
dimitri's document that you talked about

1704
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,520
earlier which has to be on standard

1705
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,640
track currently because the algorithms

1706
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,239
for ds

1707
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:11,360
um are stated as being standard required

1708
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:13,280
um how and and we're going to have a

1709
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,759
bunch more of these coming in the future

1710
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,519
with post-quantum signature algorithms

1711
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,360
and when i say a bunch i believe we'll

1712
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:21,600
probably have three or four at least

1713
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,679
as people try this one try that one and

1714
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,760
such like that

1715
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:27,440
and we don't need to have this problem

1716
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,159
other ietf working groups

1717
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,159
have all of their algorithms uh done

1718
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:34,879
either by expert review or just

1719
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,519
rfc required so an informational rfc is

1720
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,760
okay

1721
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,880
um and if you look in in this document

1722
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,640
you will see

1723
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,960
that uh um that we just forgot with ds

1724
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,360
and

1725
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,679
nsec3 records you know we actually made

1726
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,120
everything else for dns sec

1727
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,520
uh the uh rfc required

1728
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,360
um but we we didn't do it for ds records

1729
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,840
because we weren't updating that

1730
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,839
next slide

1731
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:01,510
[Music]

1732
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,840
thanks so um

1733
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:13,280
like i said earlier you know we we

1734
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:16,480
actually we the working group actually

1735
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:19,920
looked at this um in 2010 with rfc

1736
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:22,400
6014 and um

1737
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,840
we made all of the dnsec registries rfc

1738
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:25,519
required meaning it could be an

1739
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,040
informational rfc it doesn't have to

1740
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,040
come through the working group

1741
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,159
um and we forgot ds records and then

1742
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,840
sec3

1743
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:36,879
um so the current draft

1744
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:40,800
simply makes ds records and then sec3

1745
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,760
um be just rfc required and again this

1746
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,719
this would make it easier for people uh

1747
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,560
to

1748
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,640
um to get what they want and

1749
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,480
faster without getting in our without us

1750
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,960
having to spend a lot of time on it

1751
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,959
next slide

1752
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,480
so uh to backtrack there are three

1753
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,159
things that we could choose

1754
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:06,718
which working group different working

1755
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:08,879
groups choose for algorithm

1756
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,159
assignment we can have standard

1757
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:12,800
requirement which is what we

1758
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:15,759
currently have for ds records which also

1759
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:19,280
must have a full ietf review

1760
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,080
which of course takes a lot longer and

1761
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,840
anytime anyone wants one of these for a

1762
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,120
dns sec ds record

1763
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,120
um it's going to probably have to come

1764
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,840
to dns off that is it would not be able

1765
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,679
to start

1766
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,719
um with with an ad or it could be rfc

1767
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:33,679
required

1768
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,600
which can be done through the

1769
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:36,320
independent series editor which doesn't

1770
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,159
require

1771
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,199
an ietf review although the isg gets to

1772
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:43,839
preview it

1773
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,799
those still can come through dns ops so

1774
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,520
if someone is

1775
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,000
is saying i want an rfc and it comes to

1776
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,000
dns

1777
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,760
off that's fine it's just rc required

1778
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,080
doesn't have to come through

1779
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,080
dns off and go through the ietf it can

1780
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,159
go through the ise

1781
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,920
or just specification required which is

1782
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,519
any external document

1783
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,840
it could be a particular version of

1784
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,120
internet draft it can be an rfc

1785
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,440
so rfcs you know are there um

1786
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:11,599
with specification required uh for like

1787
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,799
ds records it's not like that anyone can

1788
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,840
get whatever they want

1789
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,040
um it will definitely have an expert

1790
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,360
review um

1791
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,679
so it's not like we're giving them out

1792
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:23,599
like candy

1793
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,000
and as we've seen for many of the other

1794
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,480
things in the dns op has done

1795
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,280
expert review is completely sufficient

1796
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,280
for

1797
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,199
fixing things that people want and yet

1798
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,880
still getting them

1799
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:37,519
the code points that they really want

1800
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,520
next slide

1801
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:45,679
[Music]

1802
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:46,400
so just to be clear ex if we said expert

1803
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,320
review

1804
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,239
not even rfc required but just expert

1805
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:52,880
review um the experts

1806
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,360
actually are assigned by the isg so it's

1807
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,679
not

1808
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,040
just that someone says i'm an expert um

1809
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,560
someone has to agree that they're an

1810
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,199
expert

1811
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,440
and the isg can replace experts so if an

1812
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:05,519
expert sort of goes rogue

1813
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,960
they're going too slowly they're going

1814
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,280
they're being too conservative

1815
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,000
they're being too liberal i dropped an o

1816
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,280
there

1817
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,719
um the isg can replace them and does

1818
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,920
replace them at times so

1819
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:17,760
you know it's not going to be like that

1820
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,600
we're going to have an inherently

1821
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,960
polluted registry if we just go with

1822
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,440
expert review

1823
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,360
so and and anytime an expert makes a

1824
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,159
decision especially against the code

1825
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,920
point

1826
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:30,960
um request uh decisions can be appealed

1827
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,679
to the isg

1828
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:35,199
they are often the isg sometimes over

1829
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,640
overturns experts

1830
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:41,360
uh often doesn't um so

1831
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,480
really what what we in dns op need to

1832
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,159
decide

1833
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:49,199
um is do we want to do things

1834
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:50,480
with our with a a standard require or do

1835
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,519
we want to do things like

1836
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,199
tls and ipsec and that's mine

1837
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,880
which are are mostly going towards

1838
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,519
specification required with expert

1839
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,280
review

1840
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,280
and as far as i know none of them have

1841
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,000
had any actual problems with that

1842
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:06,239
none of them have gotten their uh

1843
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,480
registries polluted with junk

1844
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,080
or anything like that but that's what

1845
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,639
the working group has to decide

1846
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,640
last slide

1847
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,239
thanks so here are the possible next

1848
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:22,239
steps

1849
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:24,320
one is do nothing that is don't adopt

1850
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:28,239
this draft um at which point

1851
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,199
then uh the the gost signing still has

1852
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,360
to be a standard

1853
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:32,879
which means it would have to go through

1854
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:34,880
uh working group last call

1855
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,080
and then followed by ietf last call it

1856
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,280
might have to come back to the working

1857
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,559
group there are questions

1858
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:43,199
such like that and if we do nothing then

1859
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:47,199
in a few years when we get all of the uh

1860
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:48,960
post quantum signature algorithms um

1861
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:50,000
then we're gonna have to you know all of

1862
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,120
them will have to come through the

1863
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,199
working group

1864
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:57,440
um we can adopt this you know this draft

1865
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:59,199
um and choose rfc required which is what

1866
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,480
is in the current draft

1867
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:05,519
so with if we do that then

1868
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:08,080
um dimitri can um

1869
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:09,840
just you know keep moving his draft

1870
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,360
forward in the working group but as an

1871
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,480
informational rfc

1872
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:17,199
um and that would match basically all of

1873
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:18,799
the national crypto rfcs in the ietf

1874
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,960
except for ghost

1875
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,400
for dns sec which we did the last time

1876
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,120
and we also made a standard but

1877
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,599
basically

1878
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,880
if you look at the national crypto um

1879
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,880
for

1880
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,800
asian countries for other other things

1881
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,320
for goss they're all just informational

1882
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,320
and i think they should be

1883
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,239
or we can adopt this document and then

1884
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,159
choose specification required

1885
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,000
um again at which point dimitri could

1886
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:42,799
move um his document

1887
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,320
through through here as an informational

1888
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,000
rfc he can take it out of the working

1889
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,080
group whatever um

1890
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,520
i i bet that he'll leave it here because

1891
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,639
we're almost done with it

1892
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:56,000
um and but then that would also mean

1893
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:59,199
that when future ones come for either

1894
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,800
rfc required or specification required

1895
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:02,799
they don't have to come to the working

1896
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,920
group they can if we want to pull them

1897
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:06,880
in

1898
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:08,159
so that's my last slide and it's up to

1899
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,960
the working group and the chairs to

1900
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:14,799
decide

1901
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:16,960
what they want to do for the next steps

1902
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,880
thanks paul i remember the the last time

1903
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,400
you brought this up we had some

1904
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,080
um issues raised by some of the

1905
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,879
implementers about

1906
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,080
you know how do we give guidance on to

1907
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,639
the implementers and stuff and

1908
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,080
and that's where i kind of like to hear

1909
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,520
if any of the implementers like to speak

1910
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:35,280
up and sort of

1911
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,280
say their piece um

1912
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,120
they they they were the ones that had

1913
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:40,960
you know good arguments

1914
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,719
like how do we sort of give guidance you

1915
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,239
know in the registry as well

1916
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:46,719
as the things that we should implement

1917
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:48,320
versus not and maybe we fix the registry

1918
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,440
to sort of give better guidance that way

1919
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,199
as well right

1920
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:52,879
well we've already done that we already

1921
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:54,839
have the should you know

1922
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,719
the the should be implemented not

1923
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,120
implemented uh we already passed that

1924
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:02,000
and so this would tie right into that

1925
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,599
yeah but but again i i certainly yeah i

1926
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,400
am not an implementer and i don't have

1927
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,880
to deal with this

1928
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,320
and i don't have to deal with you know

1929
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:10,159
the the stuff that's coming down the

1930
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:14,559
line with post-quantum either which

1931
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:14,559
will be probably a lot more painful

1932
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,840
bars

1933
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,159
we can't actually hear your words i just

1934
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,400
recognize your voice

1935
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:44,879
all right uh let me look at my settings

1936
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,879
and get back

1937
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,840
okay any others that would like to speak

1938
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,840
up

1939
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,840
um

1940
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,400
okay come on you want to try again

1941
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:16,320
i don't have any problems with any other

1942
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,320
uh

1943
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,840
we can barely still barely hear you

1944
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,840
leemon

1945
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,440
but we can see you now

1946
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,840
let's go to others in the queue and we

1947
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,840
can try again

1948
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,839
thank you

1949
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:48,000
i am fond of the idea

1950
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:51,120
of relaxing the

1951
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,400
requirements and whole

1952
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:57,679
uh but anyway i not

1953
01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:00,480
sure that uh changing

1954
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:02,719
the process for the draft that was

1955
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:06,480
already adopted by the working group

1956
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,480
is the best possible solution

1957
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,840
that's all

1958
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,759
mark um

1959
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,839
i think rfc requires a way to go with

1960
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:30,880
this sort of stuff

1961
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,840
invariably specification required the

1962
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:35,600
specifications

1963
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:38,480
disappear they're not stable

1964
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,040
um at least with an rsc we've got

1965
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:43,678
something we can always come back to

1966
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:46,719
specifications just disappear on us

1967
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,719
that's what happened to me

1968
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,320
so jim

1969
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:01,679
i have to say some disagree with mark

1970
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,679
about going down the rsc required it

1971
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,840
my preference would be use an expert

1972
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,320
review but of course we need some kind

1973
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,679
of document to specify

1974
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,320
the standard and that needs to be

1975
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:13,760
documented for a new crypto algorithm

1976
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,000
but i think something lightweight

1977
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,800
pragmatic is the way forward here

1978
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,480
requiring an rfc for every single crypto

1979
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,760
algorithm that might be possibly used

1980
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:26,159
for dns sec

1981
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:29,280
seems overkill to me

1982
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:33,040
some working groups or some other uh

1983
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,400
um protocols uh have done just fine with

1984
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,880
specification required

1985
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:41,040
and um uh the references don't disappear

1986
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:42,320
but and i will say this having been s

1987
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,800
mine working group chair

1988
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,759
we actually did have one of ours uh

1989
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,320
disappear

1990
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:49,920
um but as someone noted no one gave up

1991
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:52,320
whatever about it anyway

1992
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,560
so it was it really just made it easier

1993
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,080
for implementers to say i didn't want to

1994
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:58,880
implement that the first time

1995
01:25:56,080 --> 01:26:00,719
and rip it out you know so mark is

1996
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,360
correct that they can disappear

1997
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:04,719
uh but basically nothing important ever

1998
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,000
has

1999
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:07,600
yeah i mean i think we should fall in

2000
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,840
line with what other working groups are

2001
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,440
doing for the similar kind of stuff

2002
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:14,560
that seems to be the most sensible thing

2003
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:17,519
to do here cheers

2004
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,199
okay thanks jim and paul i think in

2005
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:22,480
dimitri's case

2006
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:24,799
um in either way if if he can get a if

2007
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,799
if a code point could be assigned sooner

2008
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:29,199
rather than later

2009
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,560
while we sort of you know if if we go

2010
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:31,919
and put this up for adoption and it gets

2011
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,040
adopted and we kind of work through it

2012
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,239
and stuff

2013
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:38,719
that may also keep things moving along

2014
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:41,759
for him as well

2015
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,040
so yes that's true tim um but then we

2016
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,560
would have to have the discussion of

2017
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,360
whether this working group

2018
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,800
actually wants to standardize a new

2019
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:52,159
signature algorithm

2020
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,280
that is less secure than the last one

2021
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,599
that we we standardized that's true that

2022
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,000
is

2023
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,760
that that you know the goss stuff has

2024
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,159
the same security properties

2025
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:07,520
as p256 which is worse than eddsa

2026
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:08,400
so i i would find that to be a weird

2027
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,000
back step

2028
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,360
on our part that would need to be

2029
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,920
discussed so i'm not sure that it's

2030
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:17,199
actually going to speed anything up

2031
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:19,360
okay okay just

2032
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,759
just throw it out there look do you mind

2033
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,120
you like to try this again

2034
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:25,520
yeah i would like to can you hear me

2035
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,960
better now terrific thank you

2036
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,719
thank you i had to log out and back in

2037
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:30,880
again so um

2038
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,760
the thing i would like to to bring

2039
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,920
forward here that's

2040
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,840
i i see a distinction between two types

2041
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,239
of records one is that requires

2042
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,880
special processing in the servers i

2043
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,718
would call them

2044
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,800
structure carrying records these will be

2045
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:45,280
like ns records and and

2046
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,120
dns related records and then you have

2047
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:48,719
the data carrying records which are the

2048
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:49,040
things that applications actually look

2049
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,040
for

2050
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,719
address records srv records and what

2051
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,480
have you and i

2052
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:56,159
think we might want to make a

2053
01:27:54,480 --> 01:28:00,239
distinction between the two

2054
01:27:56,159 --> 01:28:02,480
so i would argue that you uh for rfc uh

2055
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,159
specification uh for the for the

2056
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,559
structure carrying records which

2057
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,400
requires special processing and expert

2058
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,920
review for those who just carry data

2059
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,879
because they they are handled different

2060
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:14,159
but

2061
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:16,560
differently by the software so um

2062
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:18,320
you might want to make that distinction

2063
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:22,000
thanks

2064
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,519
okay thanks dimitri

2065
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,360
and then ryan and then we'll close the

2066
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,199
queue right after brian how's that

2067
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,679
go ahead do we try i just want to

2068
01:28:27,199 --> 01:28:33,440
clarify that uh

2069
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:36,800
the parameters that were selected for

2070
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:39,839
uh this uh algorithm

2071
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:43,120
uh seems to be not worse

2072
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:47,360
than they say

2073
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:51,679
they are based on the edward scoff

2074
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:55,519
edward's form curve so

2075
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:58,320
okay so i apologize i don't think that's

2076
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:00,239
sorry i apologize i don't think that the

2077
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,799
word edwards actually appeared

2078
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,519
in the rfc describing it so i was

2079
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,159
assuming

2080
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,120
that you were you were using a standard

2081
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:10,559
prime curve

2082
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:14,080
with virustracer format no no no

2083
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:18,239
i deliberately selected uh

2084
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:20,480
the adverts the adverse compatible one

2085
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:21,678
okay so then then i take back what i

2086
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,080
said earlier and they would probably

2087
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,040
have

2088
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,159
the equivalent properties of that's what

2089
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:30,800
we do

2090
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:30,799
thank you thank you brian

2091
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,480
specification and specifications

2092
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:40,239
disappearing

2093
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,239
um if uh

2094
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,280
if something gets approved by an expert

2095
01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:45,678
review

2096
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,320
um maybe do an informational after the

2097
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,639
fact

2098
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:51,360
and maybe not do them individually but

2099
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:54,560
maybe lump them together

2100
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,440
maybe once every other ietf or something

2101
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,080
like that

2102
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,719
very lightweight but at least that as a

2103
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:06,320
as a

2104
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:09,040
informational rfc just a thought

2105
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,360
okay thanks so much to how every you

2106
01:30:09,040 --> 01:30:11,280
know

2107
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:13,440
so often every thousand or every couple

2108
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,000
hundred uh rfcs are

2109
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:20,239
summaries of the rest of the rfcs and a

2110
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,159
range of numbers

2111
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:24,959
okay thanks brian looks like warren

2112
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,960
wants the last word

2113
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:30,159
i want you to mention that we used to

2114
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:32,400
pull ids out of the archive

2115
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:34,080
um but now they're generally sort of

2116
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:37,440
kept around forever

2117
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:40,000
so i think that um

2118
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,040
if i do you know if it's an id it kind

2119
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,840
of sticks around

2120
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:48,320
and so that's relatively stable to me

2121
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:53,440
this might be

2122
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:55,840
thanks so then we'll probably

2123
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:57,919
look you you chairs figure out when you

2124
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,000
want to uh cue this it sounds like there

2125
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:02,960
might be a time consideration

2126
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,719
given the uh goss as well and happy to

2127
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,440
do it however you guys want

2128
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:10,000
yeah i think sounds like a good plan

2129
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,000
thank you paul

2130
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:15,280
yes thank you very much everybody um

2131
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,880
these peer process documents are

2132
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,199
not the most exciting things we work on

2133
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,600
but they actually matter as far as

2134
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:23,599
getting technology and decisions into

2135
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,920
the hands of implementers and users so

2136
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:25,920
thank you

2137
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:35,199
hey can you hear me yes yes

2138
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:37,280
alright perfect cool um all right so i'm

2139
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:40,320
manny rotel now i'd like to

2140
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:42,840
talk about how we could share recursive

2141
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:44,320
resolver ip ranges and potentially also

2142
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,360
locations

2143
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,360
on next slide please

2144
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:53,199
so why do we care about about ip ranges

2145
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:56,080
or geolocation

2146
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:57,919
so let's start with geolocation

2147
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,719
recursive resolvers may be distributed

2148
01:31:57,920 --> 01:32:01,760
around the globe

2149
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:04,080
at least the one from a given entity

2150
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,520
and uh and the authority of servers on

2151
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,840
the other side maybe

2152
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,280
may wish to actually serve geo-based

2153
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,719
answers

2154
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:15,840
um some have been using the anatom

2155
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,960
country attributes to as an indicator of

2156
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,040
a country

2157
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,520
but this is not really the a very good

2158
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:23,600
signal or up to date

2159
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,040
um and also like an ip range can be

2160
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,280
reassigned from

2161
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,320
by an owner from a given location to

2162
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,480
another one be it

2163
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:32,719
within the country to another country or

2164
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:35,199
what not

2165
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,639
there is a bunch of existing geo gp that

2166
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:39,599
exists but they are

2167
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,840
not either the most accurate next slide

2168
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,840
please

2169
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:50,000
on the ip ranges front

2170
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:52,320
readers are often a subset of a global

2171
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,520
organization iep pool

2172
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:56,320
and people maybe may want to use

2173
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,360
actually

2174
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,840
these subsets these ip ranges as a

2175
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,120
source

2176
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:07,040
to build network caches or to build um

2177
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,000
ddos mitigation um as was mentioned by

2178
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,560
the net lab recently

2179
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,719
in there in the hdp post um you know

2180
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,120
talking to dns operators at conferences

2181
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:15,120
um

2182
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:16,880
people are using uh response rate

2183
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:18,080
limiting it works well for them

2184
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,000
but they would like to be able to

2185
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:22,880
exclude some resources uh

2186
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,560
that comes from you know a relationship

2187
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:29,280
that they have

2188
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,280
prior next slide please

2189
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,400
so goal and on goals the goal here is

2190
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:39,440
mostly to provide

2191
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:41,599
a mechanism to to have

2192
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,360
resolvers operator to share the ip

2193
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:45,120
ranges in geolocation

2194
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,199
and the mechanism on the other side for

2195
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:50,559
earth operators or

2196
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:53,519
network policies makers

2197
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:54,719
to to be able to get that that data and

2198
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,800
to be able to consume it in a

2199
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:59,040
progressive programmatic way

2200
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,360
one of the non-goal is to be a real-time

2201
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:02,800
database that is accessed

2202
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,639
directly from from let's say

2203
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:09,120
authoritative server

2204
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,120
that's a query time next time please

2205
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,799
so the current status as far as i could

2206
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,760
get it is a bit all over the place

2207
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,560
there is no consistency in the location

2208
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,560
where

2209
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,840
people that share this information will

2210
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,639
put it

2211
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,920
it may be a faq it may be some api

2212
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,560
documentation

2213
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,719
there is no no consistency either in the

2214
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,719
medium use sometimes over http

2215
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,719
sometimes it's over dns sometimes it's

2216
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,560
over private email

2217
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,159
and there is neither consistency in the

2218
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:42,960
format it goes from a

2219
01:34:38,159 --> 01:34:46,400
standard html web page to csv or json

2220
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:48,880
next slide please

2221
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:50,799
so here the proposal will be to define a

2222
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,920
publication format that can be

2223
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:55,360
used um globally so people don't have to

2224
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:57,119
reinvent the wheel they don't have to

2225
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:59,360
think about how they could prevent that

2226
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:01,360
pre present that information and the

2227
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:03,119
consumers don't have to

2228
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:05,119
think hard about how they can easily

2229
01:35:03,119 --> 01:35:08,320
consume that data

2230
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:08,799
some potential contenders uh the good

2231
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:12,159
old

2232
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:15,199
txt record that will be a

2233
01:35:12,159 --> 01:35:18,400
space separated list of subnets or a

2234
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:20,080
space separator list of tuples that

2235
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:22,159
contains subnet and the two-letter

2236
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,360
country code

2237
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:29,759
or it could be a https record that

2238
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:31,199
returns a rac8805 geofeed

2239
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,760
i think essentially there is two parts

2240
01:35:31,199 --> 01:35:36,239
here one is how to

2241
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,960
format it the the presentation of the

2242
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:39,280
data

2243
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,600
and the other part is how to find that

2244
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:45,040
information

2245
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:48,080
on the discovery side um this is maybe

2246
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:50,000
the the hardest part one idea was to

2247
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:52,639
essentially use a reserved

2248
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,520
underscore name that people could

2249
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:58,480
request

2250
01:35:53,520 --> 01:36:00,800
uh say underscore rgns.organization.com

2251
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:03,119
and i will return either they will ask

2252
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,639
for the txt or the https record

2253
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:06,320
and that will return the data that

2254
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:11,840
they're looking for

2255
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,840
next slide please

2256
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:17,519
some of the ideas that i've been um that

2257
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:22,879
have been mentioned to me

2258
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:25,280
um one is to use the ip range

2259
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,159
to basically use the uh the internet no

2260
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,880
object to

2261
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:29,360
to store this geofeed this is actually

2262
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:33,280
um

2263
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:37,360
now a working group item from the ops

2264
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:38,719
awg group um i've got a hard time to

2265
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,280
find how

2266
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,800
we could make it specific for resolvers

2267
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,840
this is essentially

2268
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:49,520
the whole ip subnets

2269
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:53,440
versus just like the subset of resolvers

2270
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:56,000
um the original ifc8805 draft

2271
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,638
was mentioning using name authority

2272
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,520
pointers

2273
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,239
um i didn't dig too much into it i'm not

2274
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:03,199
reverse

2275
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:04,799
with the record itself it seemed to be

2276
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:06,719
kind of complex

2277
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,639
but i mean for the sake of uh of

2278
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,320
mentioning it here

2279
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:12,719
and now also people have been mentioning

2280
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:15,920
leveraging um reverse lookups

2281
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,360
to find given an ip a request let's say

2282
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,000
rdns dot

2283
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:23,119
reverse record name txt record to to

2284
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:25,040
find to find this to your feed

2285
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:27,519
um yeah and i think that's that's it the

2286
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:30,880
next slide is essentially uh opening for

2287
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:33,679
questions feedback

2288
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,000
oh yeah open question maybe um yeah rfc

2289
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:38,560
8805 as a notion of uh

2290
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,600
region city postal code um country

2291
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:42,719
obviously

2292
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:44,880
um i'm actually wondering if iit ia

2293
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,639
i attack code three letter cards will be

2294
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,159
a better mechanism to

2295
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:51,840
share a location because essentially

2296
01:37:48,159 --> 01:37:55,199
that is what is widely used in general

2297
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:57,040
txt records can be abused so we need to

2298
01:37:55,199 --> 01:38:00,000
limit the size of them and then ui

2299
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:01,760
versus https record

2300
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,400
essentially the latter the later seems

2301
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:08,639
to be more flexible

2302
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,638
thanks thank you benjamin

2303
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:19,600
hi benchmark uh

2304
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:20,799
okay i think i have two maybe three

2305
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:25,520
comments

2306
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:28,000
the um so the the https record

2307
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,480
that you're um that you have as an

2308
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,520
example in section 3.2

2309
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:34,320
is i think not a good choice um that's

2310
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:38,000
not

2311
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:39,759
really a good use of the https record uh

2312
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,920
i'd be happy to work with you if you

2313
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:44,080
want to try to find a way to use

2314
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,199
service bindings for this i think we

2315
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:48,320
could talk about that

2316
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:52,000
but i think that probably the uri record

2317
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,480
like you mentioned uh or the txt record

2318
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,600
format

2319
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:59,280
is a better choice all right

2320
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,880
thanks here i the second thing i wanted

2321
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:04,400
to say was about the

2322
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:06,800
the geo codes um i think that the

2323
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:08,320
distributing the list of ip prefixes

2324
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,719
makes a certain amount of sense to me

2325
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,480
that

2326
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:15,040
that seems uh logical

2327
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,480
the the geocodes i'm pretty confused

2328
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:19,840
about i don't understand

2329
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:24,000
why it would be the case that

2330
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:27,040
uh that the

2331
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:30,080
user geo code could be inferred

2332
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:34,000
from the observed recursive

2333
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:38,080
ip address and

2334
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:40,800
i uh and i'm not

2335
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:42,480
sh and i don't see why the location of

2336
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,440
the recursive resolver

2337
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,440
is of any interest

2338
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,800
okay yeah do you want me to reply to

2339
01:39:48,159 --> 01:39:54,159
that or i think you had a third question

2340
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:58,639
uh i think that's amazing

2341
01:39:54,159 --> 01:40:01,519
um so the i guess if we talk about user

2342
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:05,440
then essentially we are in ecs territory

2343
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:07,600
um yeah which is a different thing um

2344
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:09,440
here the case is many people are

2345
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:12,080
building geo

2346
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,480
targeted answers usually using some kind

2347
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:16,080
of

2348
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:17,678
geodb database and they will say oh i'm

2349
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:19,679
getting this query coming from a

2350
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,600
resolver from that country

2351
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,280
so i put it into that bucket and i'm

2352
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,199
going to return this kind of

2353
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:26,800
this specific answer to that specific

2354
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:30,080
location

2355
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:32,159
at the moment the geodb1 is

2356
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:34,480
not the most granular maybe and not the

2357
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:37,759
most accurate

2358
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:40,159
so the i

2359
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,560
i guess i i don't really understand the

2360
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:46,239
logic here i can understand using

2361
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:51,199
um geocoding for

2362
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:55,199
uh if there's some sort of

2363
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:56,719
country specific service requirement

2364
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:59,280
but it sounds like this is just about

2365
01:40:56,719 --> 01:41:02,639
latency optimization and in that case

2366
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:05,679
i think that it's the

2367
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:08,560
it's the end user location that matters

2368
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,360
and it's the network topological

2369
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:13,119
location

2370
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:16,159
that matters so um

2371
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:18,799
i think that using the attempting to use

2372
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:22,799
the the geo code

2373
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:26,320
is um is not as helpful as

2374
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:28,320
for example um dynamically

2375
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:30,480
adjusting your responses based on

2376
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:33,759
latency measurements

2377
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:36,159
i totally agree with that

2378
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,600
i just think that not many people can

2379
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:39,599
build those systems

2380
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,800
or i've built those systems that take

2381
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,080
into account latency

2382
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:47,840
versus um geolocation as

2383
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:50,800
a geo code sure overall i guess my

2384
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,360
my feeling is that the the geocode thing

2385
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,760
um

2386
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:55,119
is is essentially labeling the wrong

2387
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,520
element and

2388
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:58,719
if you if you think that that's worth

2389
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,239
pursuing

2390
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:06,480
i would prefer to to put that

2391
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:06,480
into an ecs like tag

2392
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:10,080
as an edns element

2393
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,239
okay leemon

2394
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,920
and what we'll do oh shoot we'll close

2395
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:20,159
the queue after alexander

2396
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,480
but we're going to be running up against

2397
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:23,759
time he's playing a little bit short and

2398
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:26,320
there is a complicate there's some

2399
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,400
complicated discussions here that

2400
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:29,360
we'll go through the queue here but also

2401
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:32,480
um online

2402
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:34,639
to the mailing list yeah thank you

2403
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,519
uh okay uh leave one here i have two

2404
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:37,760
comments uh

2405
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,840
the first one is that please please

2406
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:41,600
pretty please don't use the txt record

2407
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,080
for this the 16 record is

2408
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,520
not the kitchen thing for everything you

2409
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,440
can invent

2410
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,800
so please invent a new record type they

2411
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:51,519
are not expensive

2412
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,119
uh my second thing the second uh issue

2413
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:55,600
is that i think you're

2414
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:56,719
i feel that you're conflating the the

2415
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,480
resolver side with

2416
01:42:56,719 --> 01:43:00,400
with the authoritative side you're

2417
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,239
asking the authoritative side to provide

2418
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,119
information about the resolver side and

2419
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:06,320
these are to be

2420
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:06,960
completely disjunct um there's no chance

2421
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,040
that the

2422
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,000
the name servers for net know where i

2423
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:11,840
work can can

2424
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,280
provide information about my home

2425
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,679
resolver

2426
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,400
and so how can i convey the information

2427
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,719
so

2428
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,519
i would argue that a better place to put

2429
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:22,639
the information

2430
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,800
for the resolver is in the query

2431
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,880
going out from the resolver as an extra

2432
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,080
option in the in the edns or something

2433
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:30,239
along those lines

2434
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,000
but i mean maybe totally off the track

2435
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,959
of what you're trying to do so i'll

2436
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:36,000
offer that as

2437
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:37,600
as food for thought uh but

2438
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,560
it might not be the right thing for you

2439
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:44,239
but please don't use the txt record

2440
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:48,159
thank you lars

2441
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:51,199
i think the idea here is to is to

2442
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:54,080
take collections of resolvers

2443
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:56,480
and and moving and associating with the

2444
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,480
country

2445
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:01,759
mark we let's joe is going to be next

2446
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,880
and then

2447
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,159
then you mark sorry yeah yeah yeah just

2448
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:11,199
trying to

2449
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:13,360
okay clarify okay mr mr joe

2450
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:14,960
thank you tim um a little bit of context

2451
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:16,239
for people who are not familiar i spent

2452
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:19,440
a few years

2453
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:20,718
an enterprise dns company and um

2454
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:22,559
while i was there i learned many

2455
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,040
horrible things and one of the things

2456
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,360
was

2457
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:28,239
and the reason for ecs to exist is that

2458
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:30,080
the state of the art before ecs

2459
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:32,159
was to use exactly the address of the

2460
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:33,920
resolver that you see at the authority

2461
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:35,599
server in order to infer something about

2462
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,080
the location of an end user and it's not

2463
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,639
a good

2464
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,440
cure and that's why ecs exist and pcs

2465
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,880
also has problems

2466
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:45,599
it's also not universally um adopted so

2467
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:47,760
this need to try and identify and locate

2468
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:48,639
exit addresses for resolvers even though

2469
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:50,480
it's kind of horrible

2470
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:52,239
it's real and there are lots and lots of

2471
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,759
queries that all of us do every day that

2472
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:55,759
depend on this in order to give us

2473
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,880
responses that match

2474
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:00,400
you know a suitable local cdn cache

2475
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,840
that means we can actually stream video

2476
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,879
that otherwise would have come across an

2477
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,000
ocean

2478
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,840
um so it is real and so one

2479
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,040
anecdotal piece of information that i

2480
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,560
heard from a resolver operator it's

2481
01:45:09,040 --> 01:45:13,360
quite substantial one at a

2482
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:15,040
broadband isp in the uk who talked about

2483
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,639
how their resolver cluster basically had

2484
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:18,400
to be configured throughout 200

2485
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,159
different exit addresses

2486
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,759
and in software they had to configure a

2487
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:23,360
different exit address for a query that

2488
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,760
was set up stream to an authority server

2489
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:27,199
based on the ip address of the client

2490
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:30,000
because they couldn't rely on any dns

2491
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:31,759
client subnet existing

2492
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,280
so it's an awful awful horrible piles of

2493
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:34,400
hacks but it's absolutely required in

2494
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,840
the real world

2495
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,759
um so i thought i just mentioned that

2496
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:38,639
and and one other comment as well about

2497
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:41,520
iota codes

2498
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,719
we discovered when we deployed el root

2499
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,320
that there's at least one country in

2500
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:46,159
europe doesn't have any airports

2501
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,400
it doesn't have any ir2 codes and it was

2502
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:50,719
difficult to try and find a name to map

2503
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:52,320
that country in our naming scheme so we

2504
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:53,920
ended up using low codes

2505
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:56,000
which are based on postal addresses and

2506
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,520
not they're kind of a combination of

2507
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,360
iota codes and country codes but anyway

2508
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:00,719
look up low codes if you want to

2509
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:03,440
find something that works more reliably

2510
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,960
in iota codes for naming a place

2511
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:09,280
all right thanks thanks mark

2512
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:11,040
um when i was looking at this originally

2513
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,679
i looked at this first

2514
01:46:11,040 --> 01:46:14,639
i was thinking about apl records um they

2515
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:18,000
could definitely be

2516
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:22,960
extended by adding another family family

2517
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:25,600
which contains the geo code itself so

2518
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,880
so there you've got both the ipad

2519
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:30,400
address ranges

2520
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:33,119
and the mapping to the geo code

2521
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:34,159
it would require defining a additional

2522
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:36,639
family but

2523
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:37,519
i don't think that's an impossibility

2524
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:39,360
okay

2525
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:41,520
all right thanks i had mentioned the apl

2526
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:43,119
in one in my github repo

2527
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:44,960
and i rooted out because it seemed to be

2528
01:46:43,119 --> 01:46:49,759
on ev4 v6 but uh yeah

2529
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:51,760
thank you alexander

2530
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,440
yes thanks everyone i agree with what

2531
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:55,520
lehman has said we shouldn't

2532
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:56,719
overload the txt record and actually

2533
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:59,199
there are two things that

2534
01:46:56,719 --> 01:47:02,280
that would make that book fall

2535
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:03,519
beautifully into place because there is

2536
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:06,639
rs2753

2537
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:11,199
the uri record resource record

2538
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:14,639
and there is rsc585870

2539
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:17,599
from your 2d which is a geo uri

2540
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:19,440
uh type combining those would allow you

2541
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:22,960
to put the geographic coordinates into

2542
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,960
the dns without overloading the

2543
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:39,440
okay thanks and thank you

2544
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:39,440
i knew

2545
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:45,840
so we're on to our last talk i believe

2546
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,480
yep

2547
01:47:50,159 --> 01:47:52,480
yes

2548
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,799
there we are

2549
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:05,679
hello can you hear me

2550
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:09,519
yes hello

2551
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,159
hello hey uh i'll be presenting our

2552
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,320
draft

2553
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:14,559
updates to dns associated error page so

2554
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:16,080
we have updated the draft to address

2555
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:19,840
several comments from the working group

2556
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:19,840
next slide please

2557
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:26,159
yeah uh i'll quickly go over the recap

2558
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,679
of the problem and then the comments

2559
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,280
that we received from the working group

2560
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:30,639
and the updates we did to the draft and

2561
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:32,239
especially the updates we did to the

2562
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:35,199
security considerations

2563
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:36,239
to address the threat threats threat

2564
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:38,080
models that were discussed in the

2565
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:39,059
working group

2566
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:42,209
next slide please

2567
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,209
[Music]

2568
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:49,519
okay uh this draft is introduced to uh

2569
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,320
introduced because of the problem that

2570
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:52,159
uh uh

2571
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:54,400
venus filtering is done for several

2572
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,759
reasons by various types of networks for

2573
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,759
security reasons

2574
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,360
for enforcing parental control uh

2575
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:00,639
internal organizational security

2576
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:03,759
policies

2577
01:49:00,639 --> 01:49:07,119
and isp's filtering because

2578
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:08,960
of the court orders or law enforcement

2579
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,759
agencies asking them to filter specific

2580
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,760
domains

2581
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,520
uh enterprise networks typically do dns

2582
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,800
filtering to block malware and phishing

2583
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:16,560
types of domains

2584
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,239
home networks nowadays are offering very

2585
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,679
similar services including parental

2586
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,000
control

2587
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:23,360
a manufactured user description a recent

2588
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:27,360
standard which is

2589
01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:29,598
quite adapted discusses enhanced acl to

2590
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:31,920
include domains to white list

2591
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:32,880
uh specific domains to an iot device

2592
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:34,719
because i would use

2593
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:37,280
a certain depth of fiber device specific

2594
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,880
purpose and only certain uh domains uh

2595
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,000
they visit and only those domains will

2596
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:42,320
be permitted

2597
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,280
and isps nowadays offer malware

2598
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:45,519
filtering service

2599
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,960
and uh may block certain domains because

2600
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:50,000
of a court order

2601
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,000
uh next slide please

2602
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,480
whenever whenever any specific domain is

2603
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:56,880
filtered uh

2604
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:59,598
the the end user needs to know the

2605
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:01,599
reason why it's filtered

2606
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:03,599
probably a decade back it was quite easy

2607
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:06,000
that many of the content providers were

2608
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:07,920
using http and uh

2609
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,360
there would be a http uh server that

2610
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,040
would be deployed and it would throw an

2611
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:13,598
error batch back to the user

2612
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,239
but that changed with uh for good that

2613
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:15,679
the

2614
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:18,080
most of the content providers have now

2615
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:18,960
moved to https but with that the trouble

2616
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,040
is uh

2617
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:22,480
the end user will typically see a

2618
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:24,560
certificate error message

2619
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:26,080
and uh will probably click through those

2620
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:28,000
error messages to see

2621
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,080
the exact reason why it was blocked and

2622
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,760
which could result in an mitm

2623
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:33,199
uh the user does not know the exact

2624
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,679
reason why it's blocked so

2625
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:37,519
it may try the user may try to reach the

2626
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,880
domain several times may switch to

2627
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:42,639
untrusted interfaces and the user is

2628
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,080
eventually forced to install local root

2629
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:45,920
certificate and has to

2630
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,840
reinstall the certificate whenever it

2631
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,800
expires which is which is cumbersome and

2632
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:50,560
error prone and

2633
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,880
the local certificate could be used as

2634
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:53,520
an mitm for other for other purposes as

2635
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:57,119
well

2636
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,119
uh next slide please

2637
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:05,280
dns of extended error specification that

2638
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:06,639
was developed in this working group

2639
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,280
changes that for good

2640
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:11,199
uh the blocked error codes like censored

2641
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:12,960
and blocked error codes do indicate some

2642
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:16,000
reason back to the user why

2643
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:21,840
uh access to that domain was blocked

2644
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:21,840
but still

2645
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:39,920
hello i think we lost audio

2646
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:41,199
from our presenters yeah it appears that

2647
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:43,440
we did

2648
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:43,440
um

2649
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:52,080
well we can give him a moment to

2650
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,520
looks like he was kicked out so let's

2651
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:56,159
give him a moment to attempt to

2652
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,159
reconnect

2653
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:01,598
we may actually be about to run out of

2654
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:04,000
time

2655
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:04,880
hello can you hear me now there you are

2656
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,360
yes

2657
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,800
okay sorry my meeting just crashed and

2658
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:12,480
it restarted so

2659
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:14,080
uh sorry for that uh the exact reason

2660
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:14,959
because of each block for example if you

2661
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:16,800
see here

2662
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,560
uh the categories because of which

2663
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,599
domain could be filtered uh could be

2664
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,280
quite different and could be

2665
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:22,239
vendor-specific and the reasons are also

2666
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:24,239
quite specific

2667
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:25,919
and further the user does not know uh

2668
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:27,519
which entity really blocked this

2669
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,040
domain whether it's enterprise network

2670
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,119
or the isp which blocked it

2671
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:32,880
and with and whom to contact if it wants

2672
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:34,480
to raise a complaint for example if and

2673
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,040
domain is misclassified and

2674
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:38,480
blocked and it is causing the user not

2675
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:40,480
to access those domains

2676
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,159
and forged answers doesn't work

2677
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,839
especially unless the

2678
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:47,598
endpoint is installed with local root

2679
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:47,599
certificates next slide please

2680
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:54,480
so the last session that we presented uh

2681
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:56,400
was using a https resource resource

2682
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:58,799
record type to convey the uri template

2683
01:52:56,400 --> 01:53:00,320
for providing the error page but then

2684
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,360
there was quite a good feedback from the

2685
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:03,360
working group that

2686
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:05,040
https resource record type was not the

2687
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,639
right uh or resource check record type

2688
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,599
to use and it was registered to pick and

2689
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:09,679
use and

2690
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:10,960
uh edn is option so we changed the draft

2691
01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,040
to use in

2692
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:14,320
error page ets option so if you see we

2693
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,080
have an uri

2694
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,759
uh template which will be conveyed in

2695
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:19,360
the edns option

2696
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:20,960
uh i'll come and talk to you about in

2697
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,639
the next slides about the signature and

2698
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,480
the signature algorithm for their data

2699
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:26,719
original authentication especially

2700
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,519
to deal with the problems of an attacker

2701
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:29,840
injecting this

2702
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,400
uri for example to cause a phishing

2703
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:35,119
attack to the end point

2704
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:35,119
next slide please

2705
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:40,799
a simple example would be an uri

2706
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:42,639
this is an uri that the dns filtering

2707
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,800
server would provide and

2708
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:46,639
the client if if let's say an access to

2709
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,520
example.com is blocked then it would use

2710
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:52,639
a base64 url encoding of example.com

2711
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:55,119
would send this https url to the server

2712
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:56,800
http server and get the reason exact

2713
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:58,080
reason why access to that domain was

2714
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,880
being blocked

2715
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,880
next slide please

2716
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,800
yeah and this was this was a very

2717
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:09,599
important feedback that we got that how

2718
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:11,599
do you handle

2719
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,280
error page uri injected by a non-path

2720
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,520
attacker so for that we have

2721
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,519
added a specific section to talk about

2722
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,679
the processing rules for uh processing

2723
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:22,080
these error uri 18s option

2724
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:23,679
ah there are several ones so i'll list

2725
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,159
the most important ones which is to say

2726
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,560
that

2727
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:27,679
encrypted dns is mandatory for this to

2728
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:29,840
make sure uh

2729
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:31,040
and an onboard attacker does not inject

2730
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,599
this error uri

2731
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,239
uh strict privacy profile is mandatory

2732
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,000
if

2733
01:54:34,239 --> 01:54:37,678
opportunistic privacy profile is used

2734
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,280
which means that to say that

2735
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,880
either the client could fall back to

2736
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:42,960
clear text or may ignore the server

2737
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,760
certificate validation in those cases

2738
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:47,440
there are page url has to be ignored uh

2739
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,199
any any any

2740
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:50,799
there has to be only one error page uri

2741
01:54:49,199 --> 01:54:52,320
they can never be more than one error

2742
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,920
page url because it's the server which

2743
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:56,080
is filtering and there is no need

2744
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,000
for it to help provide multiple url

2745
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,800
options it could only provided when

2746
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,360
there is an

2747
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,119
extended error code which shows uh

2748
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:05,119
whether it's insert block filter or

2749
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:06,159
forced it has to only come with https

2750
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:09,199
url scheme

2751
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:10,799
to avoid any any attacker uh modifying

2752
01:55:09,199 --> 01:55:12,960
the https response

2753
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:15,040
and uh if let's say nowadays many

2754
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,280
browsers have pre-configured resolvers

2755
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:16,560
and

2756
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:18,320
if they know that the pre-configured

2757
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:21,840
resolver does not perform filtering

2758
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:24,559
then they can discard this uri option

2759
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,560
next slide please

2760
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:32,000
the other important change that we did

2761
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:34,400
to the draft was to add

2762
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
the data origin authentication because

2763
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:38,159
it cannot be dnsx signed

2764
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:39,119
uh so what we do is we basically because

2765
01:55:38,159 --> 01:55:41,759
the um

2766
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:43,679
and tls based connection is mandatory

2767
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,599
liquid either dot or doh

2768
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:47,280
uh the signature is generated by using

2769
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,080
the private key of the encrypted dns

2770
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:50,639
server

2771
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,920
and the client all that it has to do is

2772
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:53,679
use the dns servers

2773
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:55,280
public key to validate the signature and

2774
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:58,480
it would know that uh

2775
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:59,119
this adns option is indeed coming from

2776
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:01,519
the

2777
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:03,920
dns dvd or dvd server and it is not

2778
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:07,679
coming from anybody else upstream

2779
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:09,440
and it's pretty much that uh the

2780
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,119
signature algorithms that the client

2781
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:13,678
uses for tls has

2782
01:56:11,119 --> 01:56:15,679
must match the signatures that it uses

2783
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:20,719
in the dns client to validate these

2784
01:56:15,679 --> 01:56:20,719
signatures uh next slide please

2785
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:27,840
yeah the last update was with regard to

2786
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,920
the security considerations to say that

2787
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,520
encrypted dns is mandatory data origin

2788
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,679
authentication is mandatory

2789
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:35,040
and uh how do you handle if all the

2790
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,560
provisions in case

2791
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,119
if if you're indeed talking to a

2792
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,360
malicious dvd server how do you handle

2793
01:56:39,119 --> 01:56:43,040
a phishing attack in those cases we

2794
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:46,320
followed the principles that

2795
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:48,480
a captive working group has taken where

2796
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,080
the page would be loaded as an untrusted

2797
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:51,598
page uh the client

2798
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:53,280
browser does not send any cookies

2799
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:56,000
disables javascript

2800
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:57,920
prevents any user interaction does not

2801
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,239
autofill any credentials or autofills

2802
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:02,239
any personal information

2803
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:04,320
a private browsing mode could be auto

2804
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:06,239
enabled and the error page could be

2805
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:08,639
loaded in and

2806
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:10,799
contained as container isolated from

2807
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:13,520
other activity to prevent from

2808
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:15,280
malicious uri pages but uh we believe

2809
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:19,840
this would solve uh

2810
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:21,920
any corner cases of an

2811
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:23,040
endpoint using a malicious doh or duty

2812
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:26,239
server

2813
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:26,239
uh next slide please

2814
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:32,080
uh uh i think we have addressed all the

2815
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:33,040
comments received from the working group

2816
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,880
and uh

2817
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:36,560
any any further comments and suggestions

2818
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:38,639
are welcome and

2819
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:40,480
we think uh the draft is ready for uh

2820
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:43,440
working production

2821
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:45,040
any questions thanks it looks like we

2822
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:46,799
have a couple comments and i think we

2823
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:47,840
only have a few minutes so we can go

2824
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:52,159
through them but ben

2825
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:54,800
you want to go ahead sure uh

2826
01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:56,239
so thank you for addressing all those um

2827
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:59,520
all those comments and

2828
01:57:56,239 --> 01:58:02,400
especially being thoughtful about the

2829
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:04,400
um about having good tight restrictions

2830
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:09,360
on the

2831
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:10,719
um on the use of the received web page

2832
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,040
one thing you didn't mention though is

2833
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:14,560
that the extended dns errors draft

2834
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:17,599
already has

2835
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:18,639
support for free text that will be shown

2836
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:20,639
to the user

2837
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:24,480
so given all of the restrictions that

2838
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:26,639
you have imposed on the web page here

2839
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,919
why is it important to have a web page

2840
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,400
as opposed to

2841
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:33,199
just making use of the extended dns

2842
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,199
error code text

2843
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:37,360
yeah thanks for the for the comment ben

2844
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:39,360
so if you see the extended uh

2845
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:40,400
uh information option that we have in

2846
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:42,320
explanatory errors

2847
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:44,799
it does not impose any of these errors i

2848
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,400
mean it could uh uh basically come from

2849
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:48,320
any any attacker so

2850
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:50,239
if you look at extended dns error page

2851
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:53,679
option today uh it just

2852
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:54,159
uh allows uh even allows clear text dns

2853
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:56,800
to

2854
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:58,799
throw those uh error error options but

2855
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,520
this makes it quite secure and

2856
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,560
through a lot more details back to the

2857
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:06,000
user uh

2858
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:08,239
i i think that those restrictions are

2859
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,360
uh are interesting and perhaps could be

2860
01:59:08,239 --> 01:59:12,080
or should be applied

2861
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,559
to use of the extended dns error code

2862
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:15,519
text

2863
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,239
sure but that doesn't really motivate

2864
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,480
the

2865
01:59:16,239 --> 01:59:19,919
considerable complexity of going beyond

2866
01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,839
that free text

2867
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:26,400
to a uh to a full web page which then

2868
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:29,599
requires the extensive lockdown

2869
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:32,719
that you've you've had to enumerate

2870
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:33,760
so i guess my my feeling is that we

2871
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:37,119
should start

2872
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,560
by deploying ede um by deploying it in

2873
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:39,280
browsers but by seeing if there's

2874
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,960
appetites

2875
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:44,320
to actually display that the contents of

2876
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:47,679
that text field

2877
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:49,920
and uh if there isn't

2878
01:59:47,679 --> 01:59:50,960
then uh i think there also won't be

2879
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:53,520
appetite to

2880
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:54,719
do more extensive and more complicated

2881
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:57,199
messaging

2882
01:59:54,719 --> 01:59:58,159
in the way that you've described the

2883
01:59:57,199 --> 02:00:01,598
other thing i

2884
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:05,679
want to ask is why is there a signature

2885
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:08,159
of this data tied to the

2886
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,719
tls secret when the data itself is

2887
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:11,040
already

2888
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:13,360
already being transferred over to that

2889
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,719
tls connection

2890
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:16,639
uh this is just for friendliness

2891
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:17,840
scenario yeah this is for handling a

2892
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:20,560
scenario where

2893
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:21,520
the um dns option is being sent from

2894
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:24,800
upstream and

2895
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:28,560
the dns server just forwards unknown

2896
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:32,239
18s options back to the client

2897
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:34,159
uh okay but in that case does the

2898
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:35,759
how what is the client validating if

2899
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:38,400
they if this isn't the server they

2900
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:40,719
thought they were talking to

2901
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:42,080
they reject that signature yeah with

2902
02:00:40,719 --> 02:00:44,800
this signature they would reject that

2903
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:46,639
because it's not originating from the

2904
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,480
server it's talking to for example

2905
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:49,760
consider dns forwarder simply forwarding

2906
02:00:48,480 --> 02:00:52,559
this option

2907
02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:54,239
uh from an upstream server and because

2908
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:55,440
the tls connection is not established

2909
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,959
with upstream one and

2910
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:59,040
the upstream server sends this option

2911
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,560
back uh the dns forwarder simply

2912
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,239
forwards it the client would detect that

2913
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:04,880
it's not coming from the dns forwarder

2914
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:04,879
it is talking to

2915
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:11,040
okay thank you that's interesting

2916
02:01:08,639 --> 02:01:11,040
patrick

2917
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:23,840
we don't hear you patrick

2918
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:32,080
all right um technically we're out of

2919
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:33,599
time for this

2920
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:36,239
slot we can try to get through the rest

2921
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:38,080
of our queue here um

2922
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:40,799
patrick can i mute so joe we'll jump to

2923
02:01:38,080 --> 02:01:40,800
joe real quick

2924
02:01:44,239 --> 02:01:48,080
i assume it's working i'll just talk um

2925
02:01:48,159 --> 02:01:52,638
okay but the requirement for encrypted

2926
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:54,480
secure transport was kind of an

2927
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:55,520
afterthought to deal with another issue

2928
02:01:54,480 --> 02:01:57,519
but

2929
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:58,639
fundamentally like eds options are hot

2930
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,400
by hop

2931
02:01:58,639 --> 02:02:01,679
i i don't see anything maybe i missed it

2932
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:03,839
i don't see anything in the draft that

2933
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,440
describes how for example a forwarder

2934
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,119
that receives a code like this from a

2935
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:09,199
resolver would then

2936
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:11,040
pass that back and what signaling's

2937
02:02:09,199 --> 02:02:12,879
available to do that or

2938
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:14,400
whether there are chains of combinations

2939
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:15,040
of forwarders and resolvers i think in

2940
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,879
in general

2941
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:18,159
you know outside of the the narrow

2942
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:21,280
centralized uh

2943
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:23,440
dot doe type application

2944
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:24,880
we don't expect end users to be talking

2945
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:25,678
directly to the resolver that would be

2946
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:28,320
during the blocking

2947
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:29,360
usually intermediaries and i so i think

2948
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:32,080
it makes sense

2949
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:34,639
that the dot this is not an issue that

2950
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:35,920
works with centralized dot doh but

2951
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:37,679
perhaps the draft could be more clear

2952
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,280
that this is only a solution for those

2953
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:40,080
environments and not a solution where

2954
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:42,000
there's something

2955
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:43,199
further upstream than the resolver graph

2956
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,159
that is actually doing the filtering and

2957
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:47,678
providing the signaling

2958
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:49,679
we'll make it more clear but i think we

2959
02:02:47,679 --> 02:02:51,440
have clearly made it in the draft that

2960
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:53,520
this is only suitable for deployments

2961
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:54,960
where the endpoints are discovering and

2962
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,040
using duty devices

2963
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:58,239
or pre-configured to use the other

2964
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:59,519
servers

2965
02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:01,839
okay it's been a while i'll read it

2966
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:01,840
again

2967
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:11,119
wes while we wait for patrick

2968
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:12,159
uh so just really quickly following up

2969
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:14,400
on i think uh

2970
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:16,239
joe and actually more and to ben but

2971
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,759
also to the author in general you know

2972
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:19,598
looking back at the discussion we had

2973
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:21,679
with ede in the first place

2974
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:23,599
when we discussed where the extra field

2975
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:25,679
the extra text field went in the past we

2976
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:27,599
didn't really come to consensus on

2977
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:29,199
how it would ever be displayed to a user

2978
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:30,000
in fact i think the general consensus

2979
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,678
was

2980
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,040
and it's even written in there that it's

2981
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:35,360
for

2982
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:36,480
operators to take that and log it and do

2983
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:39,440
things you know it's

2984
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:41,280
not intended for user uh either display

2985
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:42,000
so this draft significantly differs from

2986
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,480
that in

2987
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,440
many ways and one of the reasons that uh

2988
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:47,280
to highlight joe

2989
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:48,799
we did not come to conclusion on well

2990
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,840
how do you deal with these forwarding

2991
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:51,280
and hopping kind of things

2992
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:53,040
and how do you deal with you know

2993
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,960
messages that are crossing uh

2994
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:56,000
you know barriers when you get into user

2995
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,880
space then you get into

2996
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:00,000
internationalization

2997
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:01,360
concerns and everything else too so uh

2998
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,119
this draft is significantly different

2999
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,799
need e in that way and

3000
02:04:03,119 --> 02:04:06,799
there be dragons at the same time good

3001
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:11,280
luck oh good drag

3002
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:13,920
thanks fair point

3003
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:14,400
i think that's that definitely gets us

3004
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,400
to the

3005
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:17,759
end of our agenda and i believe the end

3006
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:21,040
of our time slot

3007
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:24,800
we have another slot um

3008
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:28,159
friday morning thursday night u.s

3009
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:31,679
and north american time

3010
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:34,559
um so we will

3011
02:04:31,679 --> 02:04:36,840
