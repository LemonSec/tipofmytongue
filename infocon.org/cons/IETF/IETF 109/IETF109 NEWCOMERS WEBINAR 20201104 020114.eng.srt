00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,399
space and

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,760
in spite of our desire to avoid it we

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,120
will not run

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120

introduction to newcomers

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,119
activities the ietf structure

68
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,359
uh the i what the ietf week is like

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
obviously with the virus it's all online

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
and virtual so it's

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,160
different than some of the face-to-face

72
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,239
things we have

73
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,319
um and then we'll finish with pointing

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,200
out some of the key people and resources

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,119
that are available

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,238
to you if you get lost or confused or

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
are harassed or bothered pardon me

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,360
uh we'll end each section with a chance

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,200
to ask

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,800
questions do that by

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,920
saying you know plus plus or hands up

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,680
in the chat um don't click raise hand

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,200
in the participant list because that's

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
harder to see we have to scroll through

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,159
it

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,399

96
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,798
part of the history

online virtual i'll show you some slides

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,400
of that

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,000
where you just a group of people you go

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,318
from table to table and there are

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,960
experienced ietf people in a number of

193
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,120
areas security transportation

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
routing the domain system and they can

195
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,919
there to answer your questions

196
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,759
and it's kind of like a speed dating

197
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,799
thing uh

198
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
10 minutes move to the next table so

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
it's mainly about

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
making getting recommendations for

201
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,440
contacts and

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,560
uh connecting you know names with faces

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
if possible virtually uh the coffee

204
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,639
breaks

205
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,440
um are in the morning uh before the

206
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
sessions start

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,719
and that will be in the same place as

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
the quick connections

209
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,879
um and it's just a social social

210
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,319
gathering talk

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
meet other people who have been here the

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,440
first time

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,080
uh or are newcomers or first-timers

214
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,759
um can make some good friends that way

215
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,560
there will also be experienced people

216
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,840
around to answer questions and so on

217
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,759
um the guides mentoring uh has

218
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,239
sign ups going on now uh so that

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,440
um there's someone who commits to being

220
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,639
available to you

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,759
all week during the ietf meetings and so

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,400
you can message them

223
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,759
chat with them email um and so on

224
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,638
one of the all of the information and

225
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,639
there's a

226
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,440
full page write-up is on the newcomers

227
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,279
page that's listed there at the top

228
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,838
of the slide um okay

229
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,120
um one of the

230
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,959
the yeah okay i'll come back to that

231
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,080
later so sorry

232
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,760
um next slide please so

233
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,440
how to prepare for an ietf meeting um

234
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,120
you see the link so this information is

235
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,160
stuff that's designed to be immediately

236
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,320
available and useful to you

237
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
we don't cover at all the history we

238
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,600
don't cover how to write

239
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,600
standards we don't cover how to

240
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
you know say oh i want to do this new

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,200
topic of work

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,240
right it's just like here's the groups

243
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
that are meeting

244
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
um and here's how to get in into all of

245
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,839
them

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,279
um and here's how to start participating

247
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
you know hit the ground running as the

248
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,920
phrase goes

249
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
so you don't have to sort of look around

250
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,120
and say oh yeah you know i know

251
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
something about network routing or i

252
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,240
know something about how dns operates i

253
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,719
want to be able to participate in these

254
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,399
things

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:35,680
and this is very very much a pragmatic

256
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,160
orientation for that do we have any

257
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,680
questions

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,000
at this point um

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
the we have one that says how long do

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,800
these sessions go

261
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,800
and uh it for one hour

262
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
yeah the the this uh if you mean this

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
session

264
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
being the tutorial that's an hour we try

265
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,080
to leave

266
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,880
you know 10 15 minutes at the end for

267
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,279
questions the working group sessions

268
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
have different time slots and the chairs

269
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,839
have picked you know

270
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,000
if they want to meet for 60 minutes they

271
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,680
want to meet for 90 minutes

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,720
or two hours which is

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,599
yeah different by working group but this

274
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,600
session is an hour

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
okay next slide

276
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,480
um so now i'll give a brief talk about

277
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,719
where the ietf fits

278
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,959
into the organization the whole

279
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,720
ecosystem that's around the ietf so

280
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:37,599
next slide please

281
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,880
um okay so our mission um

282
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,360
i'll read this out loud the mission of

283
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
the ietf is to make the internet work

284
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,480
better

285
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,320
by providing high quality relevant

286
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,399
technical documents

287
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,880
that influence the way people design use

288
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,839
and manage the internet

289
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,519
now one phrase you hear a lot is we're

290
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,320
not the protocol police

291
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
as in if you do something that doesn't

292
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,279
meet

293
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,680
you know the http 1.1

294
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,640
spec there's nothing we're going to do

295
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,479
about it you know we're not going to

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,160
come and turn off your router

297
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,360
um but the purpose of all of the

298
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,760
of what we write is

299
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
and it goes back to the very first

300
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,800
definit in the very original definition

301
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,440
of rfc which is request for comments

302
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
um if you want to work with the other

303
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,720
people

304
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,279
on the internet in this area then these

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,160
are the

306
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,079
guidelines for how you should do it um

307
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
and the standards language has phrases

308
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,399
like you must do this so you should do

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,160
this

310
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,160
you should not do that but

311
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
it's up to the individual installations

312
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,040
software developers and so on

313
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,519
uh to write things uh we want to develop

314
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
things

315
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,519
that are useful um that they

316
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,560
that's functional it cannot do what it's

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,880
needed

318
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,880
um it's scalable we want to you know the

319
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,519
phrase deploy at scale

320
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,760
right the the internet uh we're

321
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,200
developing standards here that run over

322
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,120
the whole internet

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
and through the whole internet so

324
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,079
scalability is very definitely important

325
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
security in the past few years has

326
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,319
become more important

327
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,240
to the ietf so we see things like

328
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,760
end-to-end encryption

329
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,360
tls encrypting more and more data time

330
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
is important you don't want to be able

331
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,200
to send someone's clock back in the past

332
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,600
and replay old messages

333
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
so that's got more security and so on

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,120
and then there's a lot

335
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,160
many working groups and operate devoted

336
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,720
to operational issues

337
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,319
the domain system is complicated and

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,680
getting that properly deployed and

339
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,440
operating

340
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,359
there are hints for how to do stuff

341
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,360
uh okay next slide please

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,279
so what is the ietf

343
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,200
we are a standards development

344
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,839
organization sdo

345
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,760
uh other ones you might have heard of

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
are w3c

347
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:11,200
oasis nc

348
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:14,639
ecma etsy itu is another big global one

349
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,519
we're different from almost all of those

350
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,240
the way you join an ietf working group

351
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,360
is you sign up for the mailing list

352
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,360
if it's one of the more

353
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,440
recent working groups you can just

354
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,440
follow the repo on github

355
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,480
for example and get comments that way

356
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
there's no

357
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,240
formal government role there's no formal

358
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,200
voting

359
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,199
we don't and if we were doing this

360
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,320
face-to-face i'd i'd run a sample one at

361
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,839
the end of the meeting

362
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,680
but we hum and how we hum virtually is

363
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
we're trying to work out the details but

364
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,560
humming has the advantage

365
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,880
and of course there's an rc on it um

366
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,399
you can't tell who's humming you can't

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,000
look at a raised hands and say oh yeah

368
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,920
i'm going to vote like he did

369
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,839
because we're both in the same company

370
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,599
and you can't tell who's humming

371
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,320
yes or who's humming no it's very

372
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,440
difficult it's driven by market-based

373
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,839
adoption meaning uh a standard is only

374
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,880
useful if it's used

375
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,720
okay if somebody

376
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,839
we tried to look at if we should develop

377
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,560
a standard for internet file systems and

378
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,079
came after one meeting we said nope

379
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,599
because nobody's interested in working

380
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,800
with us on it we so we have

381
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,720
you know dropbox and all of the other

382
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,800
companies are all doing their own thing

383
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,120
uh bottom up means the people who

384
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,880
the individuals who are on the working

385
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,079
group and are writing the documents

386
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
that's the product and that's why we're

387
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,519
but we say we're bottom

388
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,519
up uh next slide please

389
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,519
so the ietf is

390
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,399
has divided itself into what's currently

391
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:02,560
seven right so seven technical areas

392
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
and i won't read this eye chart they

393
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
have shifted around over time we've

394
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,760
created new areas

395
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,199
um we have um

396
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:18,079
made merged some into others and so on

397
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:21,519
so they it's a malleable structure

398
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,120
every area has two or three area

399
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,160
directors

400
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
the bottom one gen is general and that's

401
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,240
devoted to the ietf itself so that's

402
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,399
where we have

403
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,680
rfcs and working groups discussing how

404
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,399
we pick venues for

405
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,839
meeting how we decide who can be on the

406
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
nominating committee and so on

407
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
and that's just run by one person the

408
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,079
general chair

409
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
sorry the ietf chair is the area

410
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
director for gen

411
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
but all of the others have two or three

412
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,479
people who have got you know

413
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,839
for the most part years of knowledge on

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,040
these things

415
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,800
okay next slide i'll talk a little bit

416
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,800
more about humming and consensus

417
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,079
pardon me so the ietf really likes this

418
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,440
phrase it came from dave clark

419
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,839
a research professor at mit

420
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,000
very much involved in the early days of

421
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,560
the arpanet and

422
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,880
follow on the internet we reject king's

423
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,319
presidents and voting

424
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,399
meaning its consensus

425
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,360
and we believe in rough consensus and

426
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,360
running code

427
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
in other words nobody's ahead of anybody

428
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,880
else

429
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,560
something that can be deployed has a big

430
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
advantage

431
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,638
rough consensus is interesting it

432
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,079
doesn't mean we all agree

433
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
and it doesn't mean that we've

434
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,560
necessarily compromised

435
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:48,000
but it means that all of the points

436
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:51,199
were raised and if somebody says well

437
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
this is bad because of abc

438
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
the working group can decide well that's

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,880
a

440
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
yeah we see your point your point but we

441
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,000
disagree with you

442
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,519
so it doesn't have to be that everything

443
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
was addressed and it doesn't have to

444
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,280
mean that everybody

445
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
has compromised uh it just means that

446
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,000
all

447
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
the concerns have been heard not

448
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
necessarily accommodated but heard

449
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,359
um and that's very different from say

450
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,480
the ones i'm familiar with and seeing

451
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,000
itu

452
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,240
right which is very much um

453
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,919
you know you you'll have voting and

454
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,760
you'll have to make sure to you know

455
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,959
make the standards more flexible

456
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,559
or oasis i guess so that everybody will

457
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,559
you know vote yes okay um

458
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,559
humming uh it's a way to get the

459
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,879
temperature of the room it's anonymous

460
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,600
nobody raises their hand as i mentioned

461
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,400
before

462
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,760
and it's up to the working group chairs

463
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,320
um who will be

464
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,679
you know either are the owners of the

465
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,280
video presentation

466
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
or in face to face or sitting at the

467
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,520
front of the room to listen

468
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,559
with the help of their area director and

469
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,840
determine which

470
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,840
way the consensus goes

471
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,120
um the rfc mentioned there 7282

472
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,720
it's you know interesting and fun to

473
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,719
read

474
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,960
um if you just typed ietf rfc7282

475
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,559
into you know bing google what

476
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
duckduckgo whatever

477
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,440
it'll come up one of the first couple

478
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
links that will come up will be a copy

479
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,440
of it

480
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,640
and the official links to the formal

481
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,919
documents

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,480
which are the same as what you'll find

483
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:30,240
on the net are available in the slides

484
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,160
okay one more let's go on to the next

485
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,880
one

486
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,120
um the next one beyond this one because

487
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,919
you've been talking about this already

488
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,918
yes exactly

489
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,080
okay so the alphabet soup this is

490
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,879
sort of where the pieces that make up

491
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,879
the ietf

492
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,600
the iesg and i'll talk about

493
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,919
more of this on the next slide

494
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,080
that's the all the area directors i

495
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,200
mentioned couple slides ago each area

496
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,840
has two or three directors to collect

497
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,440
collectively they're the isg and you can

498
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,799
see that blue circle on the right hand

499
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
side

500
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,039
divided to the in the areas and working

501
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,320
groups are all within an area

502
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,480
and the working groups have a charter

503
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,678
and they are charted to work on a

504
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,840
particular technology

505
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,840
http network time

506
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,240
um the border gateway protocol

507
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,799
you know things like that the irtf

508
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,080
um which is shown on the pink circle on

509
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,879
the right there

510
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,840
um although it's yeah rsg

511
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,600
is the same kind of thing but not

512
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,080
producing documents

513
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,280
that or standards that affect the

514
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,678
operation of the internet they're

515
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,360
looking a little further out

516
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,880
it follows all of the same rules and

517
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,520
structures and so on

518
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,600
it's separate but the same kind of thing

519
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
and it meets the same time the ietf does

520
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,400
the iab takes a longer term role

521
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,080
the llc i'll mention that's a business

522
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,360
corporation the kind of corporation in

523
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
the u.s

524
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,000
the rfc editor in green produces our

525
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,120
documents and ayanna handles some of the

526
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,480
number the paper pushing so

527
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,080
let's look on the next slide we'll get

528
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,320
into a little more detail about who does

529
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
what

530
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
so as i said the isg all the area

531
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,640
directors meet they get a last chance to

532
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,399
review anything that would be published

533
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
they often have feedback and that goes

534
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,880
back to the working group

535
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
or the document authors they can you

536
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,200
know block something say a discuss

537
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,280
meaning

538
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,640
hey i didn't understand what you meant

539
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,840
by this you should clear

540
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,799
clarify this so it's really useful

541
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,799
last minute review

542
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:58,080
by folks who might have a wider

543
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,840
horizon they are tef i mentioned is a

544
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,678
parallel structure the iab provides

545
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
oversight

546
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,720
longer term things they run programs

547
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,158
such as the

548
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,200
rfc editor so the isg is

549
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,320
focused on technical and when organizing

550
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
the meetings

551
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,799
in person and the iab handles longer

552
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,400
scale

553
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,918
things the llc

554
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,799
uh limited liability corporation it's a

555
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,400
us construct legal construct it's the

556
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,280
legal home

557
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,600
so when somebody has to sign uh a

558
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,678
contract with a hotel

559
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
you know saying oh yeah we're gonna you

560
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,360
know please reserve

561
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,480
a thousand rooms for us you know you

562
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,439
need somebody who

563
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,559
a legal entity to sign that um taking

564
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
donations

565
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,158
things like that it's a charitable

566
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,400
organization something tax deductible

567
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,400
um

568
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,000
okay all right so uh

569
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,000
yeah so uh let's just looking at the

570
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,919
chat before we go into the next section

571
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,600
um yeah let's just see uh

572
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,159
how do you remember most or all of the

573
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,120
rfcs

574
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,640
i don't know anybody who does um people

575
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,320
will remember

576
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,320
the ones that are in

577
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,080
their area or things that they're

578
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,919
interested in

579
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,918
many people know particular ones

580
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,080
that affect the op define the operations

581
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,440
of the ietf

582
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,320
but i mean i've been around for you know

583
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
too many years and i'll come to a

584
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,840
meeting and all of a sudden someone will

585
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,520
stand up and go well you know as we said

586
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,520
in roc 2612 blah blah blah

587
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,200
i'm like how do you even remember those

588
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,400
numbers you just don't

589
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
you know and then people are often you

590
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,840
know sitting there typing at their

591
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,600
laptop rfc 2612 and calling it up and go

592
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,639
oh yeah that's the one that def

593
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,280
defines may much should chow um

594
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,159
but there are many people and there's a

595
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,678
joke we can

596
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,679
talk about some other time about that

597
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,600
you know um

598
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
don't remember all the rc's you have to

599
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,879
and often

600
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,919
an rfc will say oh this updates a

601
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,400
previous one

602
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,919
or this obsoletes a whole bunch

603
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,960
of other ones so you only have to care

604
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,320
about you know the latest one

605
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,760
uh i'm about to turn it over to karen so

606
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,320
i just wanted any other questions on

607
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,320
this section

608
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,159
um i think we've been catching them as

609
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,399
we go

610
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:39,520
um great there is um

611
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,600
some discussion in here about um

612
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,120
rough consensus but we we've talked

613
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,559
about it some so i think we can get back

614
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
to it at the end if there's any more

615
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,200
questions so

616
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,640
sure all right uh so i'm going to talk

617
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
about um

618
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,960
basically what uh what all the various

619
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,799
pieces are that happened during an

620
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,000
actual ietf week

621
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,000
um and um

622
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,039
and and to understand this gen this is

623
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
what often that goes on in person and

624
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,640
then there's going to be some

625
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,880
variations on that because we are uh

626
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,000
currently in a virtual environment

627
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,919
um so basically uh the

628
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,400
organized events during the agenda would

629
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,600
be your working group sessions

630
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,480
um we have approximately 130 working

631
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,760
groups

632
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,520
and some subset of those will be meeting

633
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,440
during the main ietf week

634
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,720
we also have birds of a feather sessions

635
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
which are uh

636
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,559
focused on specific um uh

637
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,240
bringing new work to the ietf or one

638
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,559
time topics i'll talk a little bit more

639
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,600
about those later

640
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
we have a number of irtf sessions and

641
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,639
there's a little bit of discussion in

642
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,600
the chat about that

643
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
um so we have the ietf which is the

644
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,199
engineering task force

645
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,799
and then we have the irtf which is the

646
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,360
research task force

647
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,480
so this is for as rich indicated this is

648
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,039
for work that's

649
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,000
not quite mature enough yet to develop

650
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,679
deployable standards on it

651
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
but there are a number of group but they

652
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,520
are working through proposals and

653
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,559
publishing documents

654
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,279
and the research groups are

655
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,200
generally speaking open and some subset

656
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,360
of them will also meet during an ietf

657
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,480
week

658
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,120
and then there's area-wide sessions so

659
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,640
rich mentioned that the areas you know

660
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,879
you had like the security area the

661
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,880
transport area so sometimes you'll have

662
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,760
meetings that are across a single area

663
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,080
and then you might have the ihf wide

664
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,240
plenaries or invited lunch talks or

665
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,158
things like that which are

666
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,559
across all of the areas or the whole

667
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,640
ietf

668
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,158
there's also generally a hackathon and a

669
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,080
code sprint i'll talk a little bit more

670
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,640
about those

671
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,158
there's usually social events and then

672
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,159
there'll be some tutorials or deep dives

673
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,640
sometimes there is something called the

674
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,159
hot rfc lightning talks

675
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,679
and then there's also side meetings and

676
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,320
open time and so we'll talk about each

677
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:16,000
of these in a little bit more detail

678
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,439
um there's a number of things that

679
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,760
generally are not on the agenda

680
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,760
including your hallway meetings

681
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,200
bar buffs which are basically really

682
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,039
informal meetings where you're getting

683
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,279
your colleagues together

684
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,080
to start work potentially you know that

685
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,799
will eventually turn into a real buff

686
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
and then editing sessions there is an

687
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,600
app

688
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,959
and even with the virtual environment

689
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,240
that we're currently in the app

690
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,360
has been updated for uh this ietf

691
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,600
uh and then finally the data tracker uh

692
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,000
is is sort of the it's really the

693
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,840
repository of all the ietf documents and

694
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,720
all the work and so you really want to

695
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,879
um

696
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,799
pay attention to the agenda i see the

697
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,480
question in the thing about irtf

698
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,480
sessions um

699
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
and they are also part of the ietf

700
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,000
agenda page and you'll be able to

701
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,640
identify them on the data tracker as

702
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,279
being an irtf session versus an iets

703
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,520
session

704
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,840
but they will be all on the same agenda

705
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,840
page

706
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,199
so ietf109 which is one coming up here

707
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,000
in a couple weeks

708
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,000
is going to be all online and there'll

709
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,240
be a few activities the week before but

710
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,240
the bulk of the ietf will be the 16th to

711
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,880
the 20th of november

712
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,919
um the newcomer overview and this is one

713
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,600
of those

714
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,159
and also some meat echo training

715
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,799
sessions are being held this week

716
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,240
so meat echo is the tool that we use

717
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,918
we'll talk a little bit more about that

718
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,679
later that's the tool that we use

719
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,520
for the meeting itself the virtual

720
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,120
meeting um

721
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
and there are some training sessions for

722
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,959
participants

723
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,918
and that'll be on the participants guide

724
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,840
um

725
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,760
i believe they have been scheduled at

726
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,639
this point um

727
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,559
but keep an eye out for those uh there

728
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,240
is a hackathon and it's going to be the

729
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,918
week before the ietf

730
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,880
and those there's some more information

731
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,720
about that later on

732
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,720
and so that's actually next week

733
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,440
and then there's newcomers quick

734
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
connection which is going to be the week

735
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,399
before as well

736
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:19,039
um we made the decision early on to

737
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,080
um when we moved to virtual meetings to

738
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,440
keep the

739
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,520
rough time uh frame

740
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,840
uh uh with what it would have been when

741
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,918
the

742
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
where the meeting was originally hosted

743
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,960
so this meeting was originally planned

744
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,918
for bangkok and um thailand and

745
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,520
therefore

746
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
it's going to be during hours that would

747
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,360
be like normal working hours for

748
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,840
thailand so it's

749
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:48,479
going to be o 500 to 1100 utc

750
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,080
um as i already mentioned all of the

751
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,919
session information will be linked from

752
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,918
the agenda page

753
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,960
there are informal side meetings which

754
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,360
are not on the agenda

755
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,880
page and it's on the side meetings

756
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,760
anybody can request

757
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,159
can go into the wiki and edit it and and

758
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,919
schedule a side meeting

759
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,520
and then you can you're free to announce

760
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,520
it on whatever mailing list

761
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,000
makes sense so if you know if you want

762
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,600
to have a side meeting for example

763
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,679
um in um

764
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,959
you know a side meeting on you know next

765
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,320
generation ntp security you could go in

766
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,760
and you could schedule that and then

767
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,000
you'd probably want to announce that one

768
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,279
on the ntp mailing list and say you know

769
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
hey i'm going to have a side meeting

770
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,760
come join me and here's the details for

771
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
that

772
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,760
all of the information on how to partici

773
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
participate is here

774
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,679
and this session participant guide is

775
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,960
where you will find

776
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,640
the links for the meet echo training

777
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
sessions that will be held

778
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,440
and then we've already talked a little

779
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,320
bit about this this is your newcomer

780
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,960
specific activities

781
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,879
so the bulk of the ietf is obviously all

782
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,720
the working groups

783
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,200
most of the work in a working group is

784
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,880
done on a mailing list

785
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,039
in between the meetings face-to-face

786
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,320
meetings or

787
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,279
or you know face-to-face or virtual

788
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,639
meetings

789
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,600
are generally focused on solving key

790
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
issues

791
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,879
so a lot of what you'll see this week or

792
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,880
in two weeks will be

793
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,840
um a document being discussed and then

794
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,399
the key things

795
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,158
um you know the key issues that are

796
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,320
still stumbling blocks is what will be

797
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,320
discussed not like an overview of the

798
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,039
whole document itself

799
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:38,559
um we do have um working groups can also

800
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,158
have virtual interim meetings that will

801
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
not be during the weeks and so for

802
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,760
example

803
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,679
a working group i'm involved in you know

804
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,240
they probably meet once or twice between

805
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
every

806
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,159
full itf meeting in a virtual

807
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,240
stand-alone meeting

808
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,799
and you can find a list of all of the

809
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,200
virtual meetings that are coming up

810
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,799
on the main ietf webpage under meetings

811
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,480
a working group will have a charter

812
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,240
which has milestones and it's been

813
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,360
negotiated with the area director and

814
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,840
approved by the iesg

815
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,360
um so the birds of the feather sessions

816
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,120
there's another slide later on that

817
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,399
specifically talks about bringing new

818
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,879
work to the ietf

819
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,199
but generally a birdsville feather

820
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,200
session

821
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,480
excuse me precedes the formation of a

822
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,760
working group

823
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,919
uh and it usually uh has

824
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,158
it's usually focused on questions around

825
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,000
scope and focus of a charter

826
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,640
and whether or not there is enough

827
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,760
critical mass within the ietf to pursue

828
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,480
a new work item occasionally

829
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,360
there will be birds of a feather

830
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,279
sessions for

831
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,120
topics that are not planning to become a

832
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,679
working group they're just

833
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,080
you know it's a topic that's of general

834
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,760
interest to the iatf or it's a one-time

835
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,360
discussion

836
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,039
um there is a process for

837
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,080
applying to have a working group

838
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,919
declared as a boss and you submit

839
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,199
a a write-up for your boss

840
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,200
and then the iesg

841
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,559
reviews all of them and approves them or

842
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,360
not

843
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,639
and you can request if you're interested

844
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,760
in bringing your work you can actually

845
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,919
request

846
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,039
uh help and and shepherding about

847
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,480
through the process

848
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,799
and somebody will be assigned to help

849
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,240
you do that

850
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,000
so we already talked a little bit about

851
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,679
the fact that we have the working groups

852
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
for the ietf and then we have the

853
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,320
research groups for the

854
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,080
irtf the irtf

855
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,840
is officially an activity of the iab um

856
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,240
and they

857
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,158
are generally as i've indicated they're

858
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,919
more research topics versus actual

859
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,240
engineering topics

860
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,919
um all irtf meetings at an ietf are open

861
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,600
meetings

862
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,799
and this rfc 7418

863
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:08,399
talks a great deal about

864
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,399
more about the irtf

865
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,720
um

866
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,960
so we talked here here about um

867
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,640
area-wide sessions plenaries and invited

868
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,760
lunch talks

869
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,519
i think if you're interested in topics

870
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,960
that go across the area you want to look

871
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,640
for the area meetings

872
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,120
so for example the security area

873
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,360
advisory group meets

874
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,360
usually on the thursday of the meeting

875
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,559
and it has topics that are of general

876
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,000
interest to security

877
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,840
sometimes an area will have

878
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,360
like the transport area working group

879
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,158
and then they'll have a transport area

880
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,279
meeting

881
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,880
so part of the meeting will be you know

882
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:53,120
specific work items that have been

883
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,720
accepted for the

884
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,879
work for the working group for the

885
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,880
transport area working group

886
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,880
and then it'll have general topics

887
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,119
we have two types of plenaries and

888
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,159
sometimes they can occur together

889
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,639
and sometimes not at all every ietf will

890
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,320
have an administrative plenary

891
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
and this is where we go through the

892
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,839
basically the business of the ietf

893
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,440
and so they'll talk about the budget

894
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:27,279
they'll talk about upcoming meetings

895
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,240
and it's also a chance for the ietf

896
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,399
community

897
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,959
to ask questions of all of the iutf

898
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,359
leadership bodies

899
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,359
there can also be a technical plenary

900
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,440
these are generally organized by the iab

901
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,159
on technical topics that are a general

902
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,079
interest in the ietf

903
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,960
there may or may not be a technical

904
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,720
plenary for any specific given ietf it

905
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,199
just depends

906
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,520
um in the virtual world we haven't done

907
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,918
the invited lunch talks as much as we

908
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,440
have

909
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,520
in for physical meetings

910
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,240
a lot of times if we have a for example

911
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,240
a sponsor

912
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,040
and they might offer a high level

913
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,359
technical speaker

914
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,359
that will provide a technical talk

915
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,400
so hackathons and code sprints uh

916
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,839
hackathon is has grown into a large

917
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,119
activity

918
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,000
uh generally uh the weekend before the

919
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,680
ihf

920
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,599
at physical meeting where any group

921
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,000
that a group of people that are

922
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,280
interested in working on a project

923
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,119
might work together on it code sprints

924
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,960
is really basically the same thing as a

925
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,599
hackathon except it is specifically

926
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,160
looked at looking at the development of

927
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,520
the tools that the ihf uses

928
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,399
so this is a volunteer team that gets

929
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,520
together

930
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,119
and develops things like tools.ietf.org

931
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,720
and data tracker and things like that

932
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,359
i'll talk a little bit more about the

933
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,359
hackathon

934
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,119
so the hackathon is free and open to

935
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,119
anybody to participate

936
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,440
whether you're registered for the ietf

937
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,280
or not

938
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,040
and it's intended to be collaborative

939
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,720
and working towards shared goals

940
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,320
um and

941
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,040
part of what it's trying to do is get

942
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,520
the iatf a little bit back to its roots

943
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,680
on um you know rough consensus in

944
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,759
running code and sort of re-emphasizing

945
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,960
the running code piece of it

946
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,359
um some of this might be

947
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,880
you know somebody who has a new idea for

948
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
something that might eventually become a

949
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
standard man will

950
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,759
propose a project and people will work

951
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,280
on that and then they can decide whether

952
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,440
it's something that's worth pursuing in

953
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,200
the ietf or not

954
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,200
it might also be a working group that's

955
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,919
currently working on

956
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,480
a solution to something and they can use

957
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,400
the hackathon as a

958
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,480
sort of a feedback mechanism into the

959
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,200
specification

960
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,040
so that you you know you do some

961
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,839
implementation work during the hackathon

962
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,599
you figure out

963
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,279
where the holes are in the specification

964
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,560
and then you feed that back into the

965
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,040
working group and the working group

966
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,640
improves the document

967
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,240
or you you know thought you had a

968
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,160
solution correct and then you tried to

969
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,759
implement it and you realize that

970
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,680
you know you overlook something and then

971
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,240
you can update your that

972
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,839
so it helps improve the quality of the

973
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,598
standards that are coming out and it

974
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,320
also helps keep

975
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,760
the mode the momentum going and getting

976
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,760
a standard through the process

977
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,560
it's one of the biggest areas where we

978
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,880
see a lot of newcomers coming in

979
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,480
but internally speaking the percentage

980
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,359
of people at a hackathon that are

981
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,119
newcomers is going to be higher than

982
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,319
the percentage of people in a regular

983
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,079
ietf meetings that are newcomers

984
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,599
there's additional information available

985
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,280
about hackathons

986
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,839
at this link um

987
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
and obviously the the hackathon next

988
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,240
week will

989
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,160
be a online only

990
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,319
so then there's uh networking and social

991
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,000
events um

992
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,520
so we don't really have social events in

993
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,960
the in the same way in the

994
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,440
in a virtual meeting as we do in a

995
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,200
physical meeting we do have a

996
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,560
a social platform that is

997
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,118
provides a little bit a virtual version

998
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
of

999
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,400
you know what is often called the

1000
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,078
hallway track

1001
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,640
and rich will talk a little bit more

1002
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
about that in the next section

1003
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,279
using a tool called gather dot town and

1004
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,439
this gives you uh

1005
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
an opportunity for more casual

1006
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,320
interactions

1007
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,920
it will also be the tool that we'll be

1008
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,680
using for the newcomers

1009
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,359
quick connections if you decide to come

1010
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,399
to that um

1011
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,240
and uh it's basically

1012
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
you know if you get within a small

1013
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,680
radius

1014
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,839
um of people then that set of people

1015
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,839
will be on

1016
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,279
can interact you know with audio and

1017
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,799
video

1018
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,680
and then you can move away and join

1019
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,119
another group and connect to that group

1020
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,919
um in addition to

1021
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,839
uh like general social events there's

1022
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,680
also groups of people and the picture on

1023
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,839
the right is actually an organism

1024
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,759
an informal organization called sisters

1025
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,759
which is uh

1026
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,680
for uh to help develop the

1027
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,640
help provide connectivity and networking

1028
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,879
for the women in the ietf and so

1029
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,160
generally we get together and have a

1030
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,200
lunch

1031
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,319
one day during an ietf meeting

1032
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,759
um so talk a little bit about general

1033
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,040
meeting etiquette

1034
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,920
um as i mentioned before working groups

1035
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,520
are generally

1036
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,040
when you come to an ietf meeting and you

1037
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,520
step into a working group for the first

1038
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,279
time

1039
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,240
you're stepping into work that's already

1040
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,920
been in progress for a while

1041
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,680
uh and so one of the first things that

1042
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,440
you really need to do

1043
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,799
is just sort of read the documents of

1044
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,040
interest before the working group

1045
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,520
session

1046
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,200
so this will give you a chance of

1047
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,280
understanding and participating in the

1048
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,879
conversations

1049
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,560
better as always

1050
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,640
behave respectfully and tolerantly

1051
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,599
towards all participants

1052
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,799
um talk and listen to people and enjoy

1053
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,880
yourself

1054
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
i'm not exactly sure how remembering to

1055
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,079
sleep applies in this world but

1056
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,079
in this virtual environment but um there

1057
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,920
you have it

1058
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,920
so for the online version um

1059
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,079
i think we're we're all what seven or

1060
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,319
eight months into

1061
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,079
uh participating in virtual meetings so

1062
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,319
i think we pretty much got this down

1063
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,000
at this point but you want to practice

1064
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,720
good online meeting practices

1065
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,480
uh test your configuration in advance

1066
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,839
the ietf does use

1067
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,720
i mean we're using zoom tonight but

1068
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,560
we do use a custom tool so there's a lot

1069
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,959
of materials available to help you make

1070
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:02,560
sure that you can

1071
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,560
use that tool effectively

1072
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,079
keep yourself muted and the video off

1073
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,160
except when speaking

1074
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:16,319
it helps if you use a headset and always

1075
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,078
speak slowly clearly and be concise

1076
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,839
technical comments and questions are

1077
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,920
always welcome provided you've done your

1078
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,440
homework

1079
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,880
there is also a working group java

1080
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,319
channel and rachel talk a little bit

1081
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,839
more about that in the tools session

1082
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,839
so finally in this section

1083
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:35,200
you know a lot of times newcomers are

1084
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,880
coming into the ietf and they're

1085
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,240
particularly interested in bringing new

1086
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,640
work in

1087
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,319
and so there's some real basic steps

1088
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,359
that will help you be more successful at

1089
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,400
that

1090
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,920
one is to um you need to find some

1091
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,440
collaborators that have a similar

1092
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,440
interest because one of the keys to

1093
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,560
being successful in the ietf is to have

1094
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,359
something that has

1095
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,359
support from multiple constituencies

1096
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,359
write some initial drafts maybe have a

1097
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,960
barb off

1098
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,640
and then talk to the area directors in

1099
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,480
the relevant area

1100
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,319
some some area areas have

1101
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,079
a working group called a dispatch

1102
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,279
working group

1103
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,280
and this is a working group that

1104
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,160
basically looks at all sorts of incoming

1105
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,880
proposals and then does a really quick

1106
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,799
you know is this of interest to the area

1107
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,160
and if so what should we do with it you

1108
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,560
know does it belong in this working

1109
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,319
group

1110
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,279
should we suggest a new working group be

1111
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,720
spun up

1112
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,480
and and then hold them off i see a

1113
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,200
question in there about what is a barb

1114
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,200
off

1115
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,399
um a barb off is

1116
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,598
a birdsville is a is a very informal

1117
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,920
gathering

1118
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,560
um before you have any official meetings

1119
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,000
and and it's called a barb off because

1120
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,560
um historically you know it was kind of

1121
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
the

1122
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,440
you know there's four or five people and

1123
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,200
we're really interested in this topic

1124
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
let's meet down at the bar at seven and

1125
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,439
discuss it

1126
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,200
so it's it's become a term that

1127
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,040
basically means a really informal

1128
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,200
meeting

1129
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,040
and so it can be one of those informal

1130
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,319
side meetings that you schedule with the

1131
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,839
wiki

1132
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,680
or it could be you know it's

1133
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,680
it's not going to have official agenda

1134
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,759
time um

1135
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,240
but it's any way that you find to gather

1136
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,520
collaborators together

1137
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:32,000
to uh explore your your um

1138
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,920
idea um and if you think of in terms of

1139
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,680
you know you often hear stories of early

1140
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,520
internet technology and

1141
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,879
and you know a couple folks sitting in a

1142
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,400
bar with a napkin

1143
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,200
and drawing up a design for a new

1144
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,839
protocol that's that's the

1145
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,078
the idea behind to barb off

1146
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,078
um

1147
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,480
great uh so hold the buff uh consent and

1148
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,480
then

1149
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,160
consensus will determine what happens as

1150
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,240
a result of the buff

1151
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,759
there is a a whole tutorial on bringing

1152
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,799
new work to the ietf and here's the

1153
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,440
slides in the video for that tutorial

1154
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,079
uh so now we're at the third section i

1155
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,280
think we're

1156
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,960
pretty caught up on questions so rich

1157
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,960
uh i'm gonna hand it back to you

1158
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,319
okay great um yeah so i'm gonna talk

1159
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,800
about

1160
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,240
uh some of the key people and roles that

1161
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,640
are involved uh

1162
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,078
just some general information and

1163
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,960
tooling that party

1164
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,920
that we haven't uh already covered so

1165
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,920
next slide please

1166
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,319
so uh the first group of people is

1167
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,920
obviously us

1168
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,359
those of us who are participating that

1169
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,040
would be all of you folks

1170
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,480
out there karen and me and thousands

1171
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,800
of buckers um a typical ietf

1172
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,720
person will have you know a thousand

1173
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,240
people in a hotel a thousand plus people

1174
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,720
in a hotel for a week

1175
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,799
um the online tend to have several

1176
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,520
hundred because people tend to drop in

1177
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,520
and out

1178
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,880
for just the meetings that they you know

1179
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,520
they want to know

1180
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,160
um as karen said the people are you know

1181
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,520
you

1182
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,879
when you come to a meeting um these the

1183
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,440
people have been working on it

1184
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,160
between meetings um so they're

1185
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,200
passionate

1186
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,520
they're they're vocal um

1187
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,520
that can be obnoxious but that's because

1188
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,520
you know looking at the bottom right one

1189
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,040
we've known each other for a long time

1190
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,040
and we're also very friendly

1191
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,640
nobody's caught up on roles and titles

1192
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,560
everybody

1193
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,560
represents themselves as an individual

1194
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,160
so on the next slide i'll talk about

1195
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,079
some of the resources

1196
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,000
but the key thing is if you know your

1197
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,319
stuff if you know the technology

1198
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,720
or you're willing to learn you just sit

1199
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,319
back and watch for a while

1200
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,359
that's it you're part of the group don't

1201
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,480
worry about it um

1202
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:54,880
people dress comfortably um but

1203
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,599
you know business casual or sometimes

1204
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,240
less

1205
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,880
but you know they dress we talk to each

1206
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,160
other frankly and openly

1207
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,760
and socializing is a big part of it

1208
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,200
which obviously takes a hit

1209
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,200
during these times next slide please

1210
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:19,279
so um looking you know we said

1211
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,079
the the organization is you know bottom

1212
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,520
up directed in terms of the the work

1213
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,760
items are determined by

1214
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,440
the people who want to work on them um

1215
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,839
either there's a working group for it or

1216
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,839
there is a birds of a feather bath

1217
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:37,200
for informal first gatherings to do it

1218
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,480
um and then the layers above the working

1219
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,118
group chairs

1220
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,560
every working group has one or two

1221
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,680
sometimes three

1222
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,799
chairs whose job is to keep the process

1223
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,919
flowing

1224
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,240
they're not there to act

1225
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,520
as the ultimate technical resources for

1226
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,839
the working group

1227
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,440
if a working group chair wants to say

1228
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,759
something they'll sort of say okay

1229
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,160
speaking is an individual or

1230
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,319
the common phrase it uses with no hats

1231
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,879
meaning i take off the hat that says

1232
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,560
i'm a chair um and now i'm speaking as

1233
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,640
an individual i think we should do this

1234
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,040
working groups organized as i showed

1235
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,520
earlier into areas

1236
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,319
so the area directors will typically

1237
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,400
attend

1238
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,359
will unless there's a conflict attend

1239
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,440
the working groups that they're

1240
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,759
responsible for

1241
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,960
and then there's the general ietf chair

1242
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,960
currently alissa cooper

1243
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:34,240
employee of cisco and if you have a

1244
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,000
problem

1245
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,279
and you don't think that the process is

1246
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,359
being followed

1247
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,359
or you think that you're

1248
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,680
not getting proper recognition for

1249
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,680
something that you've contributed or

1250
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,598
that people aren't listening to you

1251
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,879
start with the working group chairs if

1252
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,880
the working chairs are

1253
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,079
you know not going well speak to the

1254
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:58,319
area director and

1255
00:47:54,079 --> 00:48:00,720
ultimately you could speak to alyssa um

1256
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:02,079
we want to stop it as low on the totem

1257
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,919
you know as low in the process as

1258
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,839
possible

1259
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,839

1277
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,280
they handle the registration they handle

1278
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,960
meeting conflicts they handle

1279
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,680
they run some of the iesg meetings for

1280
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,520
example

1281
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,839
they run some of the other meetings such

1282
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,599
as they take the minutes for example

1283
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,720
when we were having the

1284
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,880
karen and i were meeting with

1285
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,040
secretariat and some of the other people

1286
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,880
to plan the newcomers events

1287
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:13,599
these folks take minutes keep it all on

1288
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,839
track um

1289
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,839
they're great next slide

1290
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:27,280
uh the rfc editor and the instep so

1291
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:30,799
the rc editor also called the rpc

1292
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:32,559
rfc production center they edit

1293
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,400
they do the final copy editing on the

1294
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:34,960
documents make sure everything is clear

1295
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,000
all the

1296
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,920
eyes are dotted the t's are crossed um

1297
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,599
that the graphics translate if there's

1298
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,160
any and that the references to other

1299
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,079
rfcs are all handled so if we say in rfc

1300
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,839
this rfc obsoletes that one

1301
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,119
then they go back and change it so that

1302
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:52,558
the old one says

1303
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,960
obsoleted by the new one um

1304
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,079
they're great ayanna many rfcs

1305
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:04,319
have spaces in them

1306
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:07,760
for expansion let's call it where

1307
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:12,000
for example dns we'll say here's a query

1308
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:13,599
and you might know a or quad a forays is

1309
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,040
a general address lookup

1310
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,440
then there's a kind of i want to look up

1311
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,279
the host that's responsible for the mail

1312
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,480
and there's a collection of those kinds

1313
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,040
of things where there's

1314
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,559
holes in the protocols that other fields

1315
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,960
could be filled in later

1316
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,720
that's a lot of that is iana the

1317
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,400
internet assigned

1318
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,399
network numbers authority

1319
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,359
the fact that http is on port 80 and

1320
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,480
https is on port

1321
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,839
port 443

1322
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,280
those records are maintained by ayanna

1323
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,799
the best thing about them when we meet

1324
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,559
face to face is as you can see on the

1325
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,319
tables here they have lots of candy so

1326
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,800
you grab a quick snack

1327
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,558
also very friendly people and they work

1328
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,920
for the most part with the same or the

1329
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,640
same organization that runs the

1330
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,640
secretariat

1331
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:07,919
next slide the ombuds team

1332
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,559
if something goes wrong on a personal

1333
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,160
level

1334
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,800
as opposed to like a process or a

1335
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,839
technical level um

1336
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,599
we don't we don't tolerate harassment or

1337
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,279
harassment

1338
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,960
we don't allow it we dislike it and

1339
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,800
we will you know tell people remove

1340
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,880
people from mailing lists and so on

1341
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,440
if they are doing these kinds of things

1342
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,079
um these three people

1343
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,599
uh allison pete and melinda pete is

1344
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,079
obviously the one in the middle

1345
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,960
um we have an at the harassment policy

1346
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,200
and if

1347
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,359
you feel that you're being harassed or

1348
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,200
if you notice that someone is

1349
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,520
writing really objectionable material to

1350
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,759
you

1351
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,520
personally contact them

1352
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,040
and there's an roc for it you can

1353

1354
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,759
up

1355
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,440
in the data tracker and find their

1356
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,280
addresses and so on

1357
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,359
we hope it doesn't happen the number of

1358
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,040
incidents where this happens is very

1359
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,160
very small but we want to make sure that

1360
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,079
we're really

1361
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:14,558
you know welcoming and open to all

1362
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,599
without fear uh next slide

1363
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,880
so new newcomers resources um

1364
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,040
the dao of the ietf this is

1365
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,599
an old historic document it was just

1366
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,640
recently refreshed

1367
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,680
by i think niels that

1368
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,078
explains the way the ietf and is full of

1369
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,879
you know

1370
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,720
not too many zen cones but things like

1371
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,200
rough consensus and running code and so

1372
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,598
on it's a fairly short read it's good

1373
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,359
uh i think you've seen the newcomers

1374
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,800
page about three times so far

1375
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,799
plus you've also gotten in mail

1376
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,720
karen mentioned in the past we've had

1377
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,000
technical tutorials

1378
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,279
this tutorial will show up in video at

1379
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,960
some point

1380
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,119
it's being recorded and uploaded to

1381
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:01,359
youtube later on

1382
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,880
so you can see the other tutorials are

1383
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,640
available and for the most part

1384
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,240
many of them are still applicable and

1385
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,359
interesting uh

1386
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,879
the service discovering services through

1387
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:16,160

1390
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,759
first time attendees mailing list

1391
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:26,720

1396
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,119
designed to be a welcoming space

there are many meeting lists uh many

1401
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,280
mailing lists about meetings um

1402
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,960
socialist travel companions that tends

1403
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,880
to not be that important in these

1404
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,480
virtual days

1405
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,000
but when we meet face to face they'll

1406
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,319
often be things like hey anybody you

1407
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,599

1411
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,359
next slide please okay

1412
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:16,880
uh the data tracker so that's name there

1413
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,000
in the upper left and the picture

1414
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,319
screenshot is in the right um also known

1415
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,280
as

1416
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:28,160
dt so abbreviated dt.ietf.org

1417
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,960
this has pages for this handles the

1418
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,040
workflow

1419
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,800
and the document storage for our for the

1420
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,079
ietf

1421
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,400
so you see on the right here uh the tls

1422
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,480
working group

1423
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,480
there's tabs for about that would be the

1424
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,640
general discussion

1425
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,400
documents this is the drafts that are

1426
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,000
currently being worked what the status

1427
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,000
is

1428
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,480
when we meet and what the minutes are

1429
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,079
and the slides are and so on

1430
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:00,319
history of various other documents

1431
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,799
and if the list archive is the not

1432
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,040
unintuitively named one that gets you to

1433
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:08,839
the mailing list

1434
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,400
the most important url construct is

1435
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:14,558
dt.ietef.org

1436
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,839
slash wg and then the working group

1437
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:22,240
abbreviation tls slash wg

1438
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:25,759
slash ntp and so on the tools page

1439
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:30,720
has a bunch of links and tools and text

1440
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:33,119
for helping produce drafts document them

1441
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,598
produce drafts sorry format them and so

1442
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,000
on um you won't need that at first

1443
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:39,839
at the start but the data tracker is

1444
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,680
definitely a way to start up you can say

1445
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:44,558
oh i'm interested in this group

1446
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,240
and when you look at the agenda there'll

1447
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,839
be a link for every working group that

1448
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,839
points to its data tracker page

1449
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,040
next slide

1450
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,839
meet echo this is our the tool

1451
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,839
the video tool that we use for remote

1452
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,839
participation

1453
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,559
when we meet in person it starts with

1454
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,240
they have video cameras set up in the

1455
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,559
back of the room and mics and the stuff

1456
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,919
is

1457
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:17,359
broadcast over the internet in real time

1458
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,559
there's also recordings made it has

1459
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:24,558
the messaging system jabber or

1460
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:26,720
known as xmpp built in

1461
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,880
it has the ability to handle people who

1462
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,680
are presenting remotely

1463
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,400
obviously we all are now so it's like

1464
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,000
you know

1465
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,720
um these are the four folks who have you

1466
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,720
know

1467
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,319
are key in it um tobiah is

1468
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,319
the guy karen and i've spent the most

1469
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,119
time with because he generally handles

1470
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,640
all of the

1471
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,760
newcomers webinars um since this is a

1472
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,160
newcomers

1473
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
session um we made the decision to

1474
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,240
switch to zoom because we figured

1475
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,118
people newcomers are probably more

1476
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:02,640
familiar with that than the ietf tool

1477
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:04,319
there are practice sessions available

1478
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:07,279
and there's a session participant guide

1479
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,520
which shows how to use the tool

1480
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,119
there is i mentioned humming and there's

1481
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,759
a way for you to click on a button

1482
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,119
when the chairs are doing a hum and what

1483
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,160
will come out

1484
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,200
based on how people clicked

1485
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,960
is they'll be you know pianissimo all

1486
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,399
the way up to schwarzondo right those

1487
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,280
happen to be the italian

1488
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,720
musical terms for soft and loud and it

1489
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,160
will help

1490
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,160
so it's kind of cute that way

1491
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,240
uh next page gather town so

1492
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,880
this is uh where we have our virtual

1493
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:42,160
hallway

1494
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,920
it's a startup that has done some things

1495
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,680
to make it more flexible for us you can

1496
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,160
