watch the jabber window and

45
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,039
um take notes although i'm hoping

46
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
is simply with the clever note taking

47
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,960
tool we can get

48
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,880
uh all the notes captured uh as we go

49
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,198
along

50
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,199
um

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
pete since you you've got access to

52
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
jabber do you want do you want to try to

53
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,319
play jabber scribe

54
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,360
if that simply means uh relaying

55
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
questions to the mic

56
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,440
i'm i'm glad to do that i i'm

57
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,638
probably a little too stupid to uh

58
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,560
uh make useful notes of things uh

59
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
relaying questions to the mic is what's

60
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
wanted in case we stop paying attention

61
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,120
attention to the chat window the

62
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,080
detachable chat should be gatewayed into

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,639
into jabber and it should all work

64
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840

198
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,760
uh we submitted to uh uh our ad for

199
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,200
uh processing towards becoming an rfc

200
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
uh shortly um we had an opportunity an

201
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
october

202
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,720
2020 date on one of the off restaurants

203
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,560
um that's been moved up toward 2021 with

204
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
all the alfres drafts

205
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,680
um there are two each encapsulation

206
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,880
drafts that have just been

207
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,560
uh resubmitted with a little bit of luck

208
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,279
in a following wind we can get those

209
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,399
published

210
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,519
uh uh uh this month

211
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,480
so don't change those drafts um december

212
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
2020 submit sctp as a proposed standard

213
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
rfc

214
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
we're going to need to move that date

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,160
into sometime early next year

216
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,639
uh probably mark probably mark mark

217
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,240
march or april

218
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,040
um and then these are the remaining

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,959
milestones um

220
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,839
the udp options draft

221
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,399
um and the end the the nqb draft

222
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,639
currently

223
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,639
for february we'll see whether those

224
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
happen or not adjust those at the next

225
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,000
meeting if they don't

226
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,600
um and then a couple of october

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
milestones

228
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
for uh the alfresco wraps and we'll move

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,240
the other alfresco drafts

230
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
uh out here let me just quick check um

231
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,440
yes

232
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,320
we have nine drafts nine milestones so

233
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,800
uh

234
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
uh it matches the chairs are doing

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,519
cherry's doing something to

236
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:20,480
uh uh earn our uh exorbitant salaries

237
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
okay this is the i was in the queue i

238
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,800
think he probably wants to talk about

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,920
the l4s milestones

240
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,279
um yeah okay so so i'm staring at

241
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,760
powerpoint which makes it a little

242
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,079
harder to to look at the queue

243
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
um

244
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,519
okay bob go ahead i think what i do is i

245
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,439
tell you to go ahead and you push your

246
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,000
mic button is how this works

247
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
all right can you hear me yes we can

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
it's working

249
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,800
by the way i i now have fibre to the

250
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,279
home rather than

251
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,319
a little bit of verdigris connected by

252
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,480
copper atoms

253
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,000
anyway uh uh

254
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,600
the milestone i i did send a note to

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
where's asking why that had been put out

256
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,800
to october 2021 when we noticed it had

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,600
happened

258
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
didn't see any conversation about it um

259
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
and

260
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
we've been you know pulling out all the

261
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
stops to get them all done for this

262
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,160
meeting so

263
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,240
i'm not sure what's going on there um

264
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,920
the crucial thing is we need a safety

265
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,800
case for l4s to go

266
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,199
to working group last call and i believe

267
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:35,279
that's in greg's l4s operations draft

268
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,880
okay you you you told me

269
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
that that wouldn't hold up the other

270
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,000
drafts i'm not sure

271
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,920
i'm not sure i said that other people

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
may have i don't think i did

273
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,000
i'm sure it was you but it might have

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,120
been wes

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,120
anyway um

276
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,599
what's going on

277
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,839
a successful worker glass call on l4s

278
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,079
requires the working group to get to

279
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,279
rough consensus that it's safe to run

280
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
the experiment on the internet

281
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,639
and i i was on the impression the

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,719
carrier for that uh

283
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,199
for uh but that mature was going to be

284
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,480
the operations draft

285
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,719
okay well that i mean it's just

286
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,880
not what wes told us or you told us or

287
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,920
someone

288
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,199
and if they had would have done things

289
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
differently like would have you know

290
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,800
pushed on that one a lot more you know

291
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,079
it's

292
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,079
sounds like communications and problems

293
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:41,439
i'll dig out the emails but okay

294
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,160
okay i mean i don't believe that goal

295
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,040
uh let's see that goal of needing a safe

296
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,959
a safety case

297
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,480
should not be a surprise the mechanics

298
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,719
of doing so

299
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,639
no it's the it's the conditionality of

300
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,600
it

301
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,199
um i believe i believe that was stated

302
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,079
uh in the conclusion

303
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,599
of from the interim meeting and uh when

304
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,040
we decided we're going

305
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
going to move forward focusing on

306
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,799
restaurants it was stated exactly the

307
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,359
opposite way around that it would not be

308
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,359
conditional

309
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,359
i'll have to go dig we'll have to go dig

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,839
dig we'll have to go

311
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,839
uh dig out the various things my

312
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,280
understanding is that is is that uh the

313
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,799
working group has to come up with a

314
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,799
safety case now if you believe that the

315
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,160
main drafts contain the safety case

316
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,360
uh we can try that yeah so

317
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,840
i would think that the key is not

318
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,799
the status of the other draft but rather

319
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
the

320
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
uh working groups feeling that what's

321
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,760
going into it

322
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,320
is uh going to

323
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,360
work yeah uh that that's what i

324
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,080
understood

325
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,639
yeah that as long as there was you know

326
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,439
the the

327
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,679
the if you like the um

328
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,160
concepts behind it or the or the you

329
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,080
know the the

330
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
the way forward as long as there was

331
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,439
consensus on that the actual text didn't

332
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,520
have to have been

333
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,640
um you know finished and gone to working

334
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,879
group last call

335
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
yes

336
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,199
so given that david is there

337
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:29,840
possibility of pulling that milestone

338
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:29,840
back in i think is bob's question

339
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,678
certainly certainly a possibility um

340
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,639
we need to come up with a tentative date

341
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,840
to move all

342
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,840
to move all move all three of them too

343
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,280
i'm all uh scoring here i'd be okay to

344
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,120
consider working group last calling

345
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,160
these documents as soon as they are

346
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,120
ready to be working group last cold um i

347
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,799
um when they progressed to the iesg's

348
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
just when they progressed to the isg

349
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,280
when that

350
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,039
safety case is clear and the milestone

351
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,480
doesn't really change this time

352
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,160
does it i think there has to be a safety

353
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,160
case in order to have a successful

354
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,559
working group last call

355
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,559
um

356
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,000
it sounds like this is why we got mixed

357
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
uh or got the wrong message because

358
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,160
different chairs seem to be saying

359
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,000
different things

360
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,400
mm-hmm i i i'm quite certain that the

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,480
the the notes that we were sent out

362
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,039
after we got through um

363
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,559
all of the uh decisions made around that

364
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,240
we're going to focus on for us

365
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,320
says a successful working glass call

366
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:51,919
requires requires there to

367
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,600
be us to be a satan to be a safety case

368
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,760
um

369
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,439
should should we take an action to

370
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,600
reevaluate this at the

371
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
uh after the wednesday meeting

372
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
yeah which for me i i think i think

373
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,559
probably the church is going to be clear

374
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,000
on this we'll we

375
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,158
we could talk to the ad and between

376
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,039
the group of us come up with some clear

377
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,600
um

378
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,640
indication of what's needed yeah i mean

379
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,719
put it this way

380
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,840
all the uh the three main alphas

381
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,760
documents

382
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,879
i've you know pulled out all the stops i

383
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,080
just reposted them all last night

384
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,080
they've all been spell checked

385
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,360
grammar checked they've been stable for

386
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,559
a while we've

387
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,240
been you know battering on the wording

388
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,600
um so they're ready for working group

389
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,159
last call

390
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,439
um and it does no harm to go through a

391
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,200
working group last call even if they're

392
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,880
not going to go to the iesg

393
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
well at the very least we know we have

394
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,679
to settle the queue protection issue

395
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,679
before we take work group last call

396
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,440
yeah and i think we need i think we we

397
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,559
need to understand

398
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,039
um uh where would

399
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
understand where the safety where the

400
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,879
safety case

401
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,360
is is to is to be found

402
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
okay

403
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,559
all right i think chairs will will will

404
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,440
consult offline with uh

405
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,879
first draft authors to figure out uh

406
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,840
what the what the what the new

407
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
what the new milestone ought to be um

408
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,600
october 2021

409
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,360

all right okay

414
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,678

418
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,840
differently so i've got some chance of

419
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,840

420
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,360

with

429
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,480

430
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,000
how to present them i saw at least one

431
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,840

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
file i can't quite figure out where the

433
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,559

to um bring it up to date with our

475
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,320
technical process

476
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,959
progress over the past year we have a

477
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,320
more detailed design rationale

478
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,279
and um an outline

479
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,279
of our use of diffserv to perform an

480
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,440
isolated experiment

481
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:16,799
uh on internet scale paths

482
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,840
um and i'd also like to say that we are

483
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,799
now

484
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,918
funded for the next year so we will

carry on working

486
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,799
in the background

487
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,760
and of more immediate concern

488
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,879
we have recently posted

489
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:39,360
a fresh set of red team tests

490
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,320
um about l4s performance

491
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,439
and we've kicked off some discussion of

492
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,158
that on the list

493
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,920

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,760
yes um i'm just uh i propose

511
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,480
i debut the transport radio authority uh

512
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,520
to

513
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,480
um develop a new uh protocol

514
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,120
transformatory

515
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,480
protocol for new um distributed

516
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,399
computing paradigms

517
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,880
such as the communication edge computing

518
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,080
and

519
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,120
metal computing so i reviewed

520
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,158
the current transporter here and

521
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,678
i want to define and divide the

522
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,159
transport layer into the two sub-layers

523
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
data path layer and the data flow layer

524
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,960
this data path layer should

525
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,600
handle some kind of uh related the

526
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,000
functions

527
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,959
related to the audit path such as the

528
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,799
demand

529
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,559
trajectory monitoring or waypoint

530
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:25,918
management

531
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,678
that is related to the um the

532
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,799
i can say um the password computing

533
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,240
research group

534
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,000
password networking research group and

535
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,679
it's used handled by direction

536
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
connection quality monitoring for

537
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,919
congestion control

538
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,880
and they throw much stretching

539
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,840
it may support some patent duplication

540
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
for the highly highly reliable

541
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,879
communication and

542
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,279
beyond that uh data flow layer handles

543
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,279
the

544
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,760
uh the transmission flow control from

545
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,320
prioritization entertainment security

546
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,039
and investment breaching for multiple

547
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,039
multiple

548
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,440
or multi multiple transport protocols

549
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,720
so please leave the uh the draft and

550
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,600
then discuss

551
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,279
it on the mailing list if you're

552
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
interested in draft please follow up

553
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
with

554
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,279

there

560
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,879
we have new work on generic transport

561
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
functions unfortunately material with

562
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,760
the the materials for that

563
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,760
don't seem to work um i get a zip

564

archive i have no idea how

565
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,120
how to display it we can figure out how

566
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,200
to get how to get a slide that we can

567
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,678
display we'll come back to that

568

um so i have the draft

586
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,640
uh i mean i have the the slide on

587
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,559
generic transport functions

588
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,880
um i can i don't know how i try to share

589
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,320
it

590
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,320
and and talk to it for for for uh

591
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,678
a cup for a couple of minutes go ahead

592
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,720
luckily i'll take my screen off

593
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,240
how do i share you

594
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,679
push on publish screen there's a

595
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,760
there's a button the screen it may have

596
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,760
a triangle on it

597
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,039
up up near where you found the mic

598
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,640
button

599
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,919
yeah enter screen queue yeah try that

600
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,640
and let's see if that

601
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,080
let's see what happens here okay now if

602
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,480
i click on that

603
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:43,439
we might get your screen okay

604
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
let's see what you get

605
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,918
all right it thinks it's sending a

606
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,559
screen you may have to do something to

607
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,799
actually share your window

608
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:57,200
share window i'll just share the whole

609
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,200
screen

610
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,120
oh how to give it permissions to do all

611
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,760
this

612
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,639
this this is why we're trying to try to

613
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,080
to do this all

614
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,760
all through the meeting materials if we

615
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,519
could but unfortunately some

616
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,200
that the zip i looked this up archive

617
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,039
there's a booklet xml on there no idea

618
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,960
what to do with it

619
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,960
okay can you see anything

620
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,679
not yet

621
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,159
wait a minute something might be

622
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,199
happening

623
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,480
i know you lost your screen share

624
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
i lost my screen share yes that's not a

625
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,519
good thing

626
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,840
you probably need to get back in back

627
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,840
into the screen queue let's try that

628
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
again

629
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,159
so the object cannot be found

630
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,200
all right okay okay so get us get

631
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,960
get us a get us a pdf

632
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,399
by uh by before the wednesday meeting

633
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,519
and we'll put that up at the start at

634
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,799
the start of the wednesday meeting i

635
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,440
think the thing is i think is what we

636
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,559
need to do

637
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
we unfortunately do need to move on all

638
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,279
right

639
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:29,840
i will do that thank you

640
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:29,840
all right um

641
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:43,679
okay um

642
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:46,559
so what i think is next

643
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,559
um is

644
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,399
sctp this update michael do you want to

645
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,158
speak to that i don't think i see slides

646
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,199
for that

647
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:01,440
i sent slides this morning

648
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,440
uh no yesterday night to gauri

649
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,559
do you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you

650
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,840
they have not made it up to

651
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,840
the website

652
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,200
okay so rory do you have them oh

653
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,799
actually if actually why don't we

654
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,120
let's try let's try the screen share

655
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:27,360
thing again can you share your screen

656
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,080
protect the slides in your system um

657
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,840
then i need to get the slides on that

658
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,279
system i'm using

659
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,600
oh oh so i would suggest uh

660
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:43,440
we go without slides because um sure

661
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,639
i need to get them up because

662
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,279
so the the the document hasn't changed

663
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,399
um since i focused on the net document

664
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,799
which is

665
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,678
finished now from the perspective of the

666
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,960
authors

667
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,559
um uh what needs to be done

668
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,399
um is um and that's what

669
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,720
i'm currently working on is change the

670
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,759
xml v2 to v3

671
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,639
which might result in some formatting

672
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,679
changes but

673
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,119
no content change um there are still

674
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
some editorial comments

675
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,800
i have to integrate from gory which are

676
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,800
a no-brainer

677
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,240
and um the removal of appendix a which

678
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,280
is ecn this was

679
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,239
discussed last at the last meeting

680
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,960
that we have normative language in an

681
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,158
appendix

682
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,159
and that shouldn't be there so

683
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,158
the point was to remove it and to have a

684
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,960
separate document

685
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,960
for ecm

686
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,560
related to http and to update the

687
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,399
acknowledgement section which is also

688
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,679
uncritical

689
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,879
because we have to adopt it to

690
00:34:53,679 --> 00:35:01,839
to the inclusion of the errata document

691
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:05,118
um that will be finished this week

692
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,078
and then the document is ready

693
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,720
gory asked last time to reach out to

694
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,380
people

695
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,720
for reviews and

696
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,720
[Music]

697
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,640
i managed to get a linux maintainer

698
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,640
so one of the maintainers of the linux

699
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,920
stp stacks as a reviewer

700
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,560
um marcelo and kachong

701
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,560
from oracle oracle also has an sctp

702
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,320
implementation in the kernel

703
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,160
um the freebsd kernel implementation is

704
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,240
covered by the authors

705
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,720
um we have two reviewers from

706
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,799
um proprietary stacks which is barry

707
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,160
zuckerman from addicts and claudio

708
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,640
porfiri from ericsson and

709
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,680
teemu folker who uh will read the

710
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,839
document

711
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:56,160
um at a whole uh without knowing the

712
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:59,279
the past um i have one review

713
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,799
one one request still open um we will

714
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,640
see but that should cover

715
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,800
every i mean that should cover the os

716
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,680
included implementations and also some

717
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,680
proprietary ones

718
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,680
okay not all these peoples are active on

719
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,160
the on the tsp

720
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,919
list so i told them that i will ping

721
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,680
them once the document is ready for

722
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,599
review

723
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,279
okay do you want those reviews before

724
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,079
working with last call or do you want

725
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
those reviews

726
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,440
uh done as part of her group last call

727
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,078
that's what i wanted to ask the chairs

728
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,079
i don't care

729
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,520
i would suggest just go ahead and when

730
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,000
the document is ready get the reviews

731
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,119
posted

732
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,560
and post to reviews the list uh don't

733
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,839
befall the last week

734
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:54,480
before i i think uh before we last call

735
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:56,400
um is gory on audio

736
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,240
i don't think he is but that approach

737
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,280
makes sense to me too because then

738
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,520
we can last call it saying those have

739
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,119
been addressed

740
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,759
yes yes so so a couple of the people

741
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,920
also wanted a bit of time for the review

742
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,520
so a two week or three week working

743
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,320
group last call time might be a bit

744
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,320
short for them

745
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,000
so that's why i said when when i when i

746
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,079
submit the next revision

747
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
then i will ping them then they can have

748
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,400
a look at that

749
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,240
okay and then let us know how the views

750
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,720
are going please post the reviews to the

751
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,839
list

752
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,480
uh at least technical i will tell them

753
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,880
that

754
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,720
they should send the comments to the

755
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,040
list

756
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,000
yes please and then we can take a look

757
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,680
at that and decide

758
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,160
whether we're less call but it sounds

759
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,200
like uh we are

760
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,720
close to anticipated schedule which

761
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,960
means we'll work with less quality

762
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:55,359
either next month or in january

763
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:59,599
okay sounds good okay thank you

764
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:02,560
okay now

765
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,240
this early hour of the morning here i

766
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,078
believe the plan

767
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,399
for udp options is we have one

768
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:19,839
presentation from tom jones that covers

769
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:19,839
both drafts

770
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,680
okay tom you want to go and speak to

771
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:33,839
these i'll click uh i'll click the

772
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:33,839
slides forward as we need to

773
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:47,839
i don't actually see tom in

774
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,839
the attendee list is he here

775
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,920
you may need to move this to the end of

776
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,919
the meeting if corey can rejoin

777
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,359
yeah if we get audio from gory that

778
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,280
would be better

779
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,960
i mean i i will you and i don't think

780
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,119
would you really could do a real good

781
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,839
job presenting these slides

782
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,839
no

783
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,839
i think tom isn't registered for the itf

784
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
i'm sorry say it again

785
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:43,839
all right let's try this again at

786
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,839
the end of the meeting i suppose

787
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,040
it's a mid echo problem with people not

788
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,760
able to rejoin at the moment

789
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,440
they're working on it oh that's

790
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,839
unfortunate

791
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,960
yeah gory mentioned in the jabber room

792
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,960
that he's unable to join

793
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,720
the jabba is also not reflected in the

794
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,759
meat echo chat anymore

795
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,520
at this point yeah that's yeah that's

796
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
also an unfortunate problem

797
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,800
thank you for for paying attention to

798
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,800

802
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640

803
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,079
meteco

804
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,118

806
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,920

807
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
regular jabra room

808
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,200
but yeah i mean

809
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,359
i just typed between jabber and meat

810
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,399
echo is having a problem

811
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,400
all right i just typed chat testing echo

812
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,119
chat did anybody see that or did that

813
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,119

i did not see that did you see anything

815
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,960

816
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,960

and use regular jabber only

822
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,839
so are there any presenters that are

823
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,839

i think in general ptf is the most

844
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,839
reliable format

845
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,200
okay hang on let's just see if that

846
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,240
worked

847
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,319
okay go ahead you can go uh speak

849
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,000
miracle happens

850
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,680
okay so basically we're looking at

851
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,480
the idea of having to do fragmentation

852
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,200
on

853
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,640
different payloads not necessarily ip so

854
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,520
it could be an ethernet it could be a

855
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,118
pseudo wire could be mpls

856
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,440
and so instead of trying to invent a new

857
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,400
way of doing it we decided to reuse the

858
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,640
ipv6 methodology

859
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,480
of course the funky thing about ipv6 is

860
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:57,200
it relies on the previous header to say

861
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,200
that the next header is fragmentation

862
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,000
the other thing is that it knows that

863
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,560
there's an ipv6 header

864
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,760
address field so it doesn't need an

865
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,880
identification

866
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,000
it only needs to identify the fragment

867
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,520
number uh so we need more of a

868
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,800
more of an identification so we're

869
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,599
using the same functionality

870
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,200
adding a little bit to it and trying to

871
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,079
say

872
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,078
um let's reuse that for fragmenting

873
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,440
other things besides

874
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,839
um ip that's uh and in

875
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,640
general we think we can use it for other

876
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,680
things as well

877
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,879
as perhaps

878
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,919
esp payloads but but we're starting with

879
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,280
fragmentation

880
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,000
that's the quick summary and what you

881
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,440
have here

882
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,720
is essentially the

883
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,440
is between a fragment header in ipv6 and

884
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,839
the fragment header we're trying to use

885
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,880
okay so please send a note to the list

886
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,200
with uh

887
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
the draft name and when you're more

888
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,319
awake

889
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,839
please send uh the chairs a cop this

890
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,839
slide that doesn't have the juniper

891
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:09,279
business use only footer on it so we can

892
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,759
post that

893
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,240
okay i i i get bit by that all the time

894
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,880
yeah yeah well i yeah i was just trying

895
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,799
to get it out quickly but i will do that

896
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,000
okay thank you all right thank you thank

897
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,560
you david

898
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
mission mission accomplished and it

899
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,160
sounds like

900
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,960
unless something happens quickly to meet

901
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,200
echo that we have a bus this morning

902
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:38,240
um uh there's we want to say

903
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,960
all right stopping because bob's on

904
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,399
uh david uh gory made a comment in the

905
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,119
jabber room

906
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,720
uh he says the fragmentation work may be

907
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,040
relevant to several

908
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,480
working groups it could touch transport

909
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,880
such as gre

910
00:45:50,480 --> 00:46:01,839
and it might be work in another group

911
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:01,839
anyway please read and make comments

912
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,200
all right um

913
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,839
i'll put here

914
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
so

915
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,839
okay

916
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,839
turning on

917
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,839
all right

918
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:14,240
um

919
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,880
all right so given the meat echo

920
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,879
problems

921
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,920
bob i'm i'm guessing the l first

922
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
material is not going to be ready till

923
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,400
wednesday you're

924
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,400
busy busy working on drafts

925
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,680
right yeah i'll be afraid of that i

926
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,880
suspect given the meat echo problems i

927
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,160
see an ed on my

928
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,079
my institution was going to be that

929
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,839
maybe maybe we simply declare that we've

930
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,520
been overcome by events and we need to

931
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,160
schedule an interim in fair

932
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,000
uh in the very near future to go pick up

933
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,160
what we're going to do here

934
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,559
well so so the other alternative that

935
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,558
there is is to extend our second session

936
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,880
into the break time a little bit so that

937
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,720
we can get through more of the agenda

938
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,520
um if if the consensus that we want to

939
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,040
do that i can

940
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,240
request that i'm sure we can get the

941
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,839
time from beat echo since they've

942
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,839
made this not viable

943
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:19,040
yeah we're missing three

944
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,040
different topics

945
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:26,400
so would would do we want to extend

946
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:30,400
the um the second session

947
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
into the time leaning up to the plenary

948
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:36,640
that would let me go look at the agenda

949
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:40,000
on on my browser screen

950
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:44,319
um can i also this is what that gives

951
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,319
what half an hour yeah

952
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,480
can i suggest rather than abandoning the

953
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,839
meeting just everyone holding into it

954
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,559
carrying on with i don't know whatever

955
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:54,880
they're doing and um

956
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,319
in case the miteko comes back because it

957
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,920
would be silly to

958
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,079
abandon the meeting before the end if

959
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,599
mateco gets fixed

960
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,680
i do know they're working on the problem

961
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,520
right now of course some some of us

962
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,759
are uh in a position where we would go

963
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,319
to bed if this investment work on other

964
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,559
things

965
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,200
but i let me see if i can get some idea

966
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:17,839
what the timing is

967
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,839
thank you

968
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,839
um

969
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:29,440
all right so while i'm waiting for a

970
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,839
reply on that um

971
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,160
do we want to have a longer meeting

972
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:37,040
wednesday or do you just want to

973
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,598
say heck with it and have an interim i

974
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,680
think

975
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,200
i think we i think we're going to need

976
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,440
to need to do both

977
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,118
please guys extra half hour on wednesday

978
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,240
and let's assume we're going to have an

979
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,280
interim

980
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,399
uh we could use the time we do have here

981
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,200
to see if

982
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,000
bob and the two chairs were on audio

983
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,598
have the same

984
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,640
view of what's supposed to happen to the

985
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,640
l4s drafts

986
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:02,880
not having had coffee this morning i

987
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,960
think where we are

988
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,079
is that all three of the drafts

989
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:13,200
uh go go to last call

990
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,559
it's not necessary to last call the lfrs

991
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,839
operations draft

992
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:21,040
with the three main drafts but

993
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,520
a successful working glass call requires

994
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,920
rough consensus that elf the alvarez

995
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,319
experiment is safe to run

996
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,599
and to the extent that the l4s

997
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:32,480
operations draft

998
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,200
is the carrier of that safety case the

999
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,599
working group

1000
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,319
has to be confident that it does in fact

1001
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,920
make

1002
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:41,920
a make an acceptable safety case

1003
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,040
bob how close how close is that to your

1004
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,520
your your view of the world

1005
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,640
that is what i thought had already been

1006
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,640
said yes

1007
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,160
okay and we don't have that we don't

1008
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,480
have a uh

1009
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,279
a communication problem to resolve aside

1010
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,880
from the fact that

1011
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,040
this hour of meeting requires copy for

1012
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,160
uh the north american participants which

1013
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:10,079
i can't go out in the hall and get

1014
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,000
i um and presumably

1015
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,280
as spencer said we can meet the

1016
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,640
milestone early but

1017
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,640
i don't know whether the chairs want to

1018
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,319
schedule an earlier time in case we do

1019
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,440
or um

1020
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,880
for their own schedule but um i would

1021
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,839
really hope this is not going to take

1022
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,000
another year well

1023
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,040
i wouldn't only hope it you know it's

1024
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,559
just just

1025
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,319
impossible if it's going to take another

1026
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,240
year it's it

1027
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,079
it was four years when we did the

1028
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,959
working group last call

1029
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,920
in in or when we were about to in march

1030
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,079
um

1031
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,040
but two weeks before that sce came up

1032
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,800
and

1033
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:50,079
it it's just you know people

1034
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,480
are no longer on projects on this it's

1035
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:55,119
you know um it's very difficult to pull

1036
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,119
it all together

1037
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:59,200
off the top of my head let's give

1038
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,880
ourselves one more

1039
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,879
one one more one more meeting cycle and

1040
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,240
uh the milestone which is the milestone

1041
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,960
for when we're done working with last

1042
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,439
call

1043
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,880
um would then be i think uh i think

1044
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,720
april

1045
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:18,400
right that sounds more real

1046
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:22,078
um reasonable so i want to

1047
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,079
i would like to understand the um

1048
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,720
what the what the plan here so then

1049
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,440
the idea is that the we will have a

1050
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,000
working group last call

1051
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,359
with the and the and the idea is that

1052
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,040
the working group will

1053
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,720
judge it to be safe on the internet

1054
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,558
because of a

1055
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,319
adopted but not ready draft

1056
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,040
about these operational concerns it's

1057
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,040
informational

1058
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,520
and that's information in particular i

1059
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,400
think we i think we will need to adopt

1060
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,720
the operations

1061
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,000
the i think work group will will i think

1062
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,399
works bad at worked

1063
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,520
i think your suggestion that working

1064
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,760
group adoption

1065
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,160
of the operations draft is a

1066
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,839
prerequisite to last call on the main

1067
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,118
alphas drafts is the right way to do

1068
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,680
this

1069
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:18,240
well so this is a little um irregular

1070
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,399
right because then yeah so in principle

1071
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,200
we send this to ietf last call

1072
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,960
with no document except maybe an

1073
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,879
informational reference to an adopted

1074
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,440
draft

1075
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,440
that um

1076
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,000
if with you know with real so it goes to

1077
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,319
itf last called really no

1078
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,319
um

1079
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,279
uh like accepted you know approved

1080
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,640
documentation

1081
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,640
on these operational concerns and so

1082
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:55,440
aren't

1083
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,119
we need to get through it flashcard isg

1084
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,640
isg review without

1085
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,200
a approved method for or a set of

1086
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:06,799
requirements for

1087
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:08,799
proper endpoint behavior which seems

1088
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,960
it's well you know i'm not the

1089
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,200
operations for how much operations draft

1090
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,799
is

1091
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:18,319
endpoint behavior and how much of it is

1092
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:19,680
uh operator i is operator network

1093
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:21,680
defense

1094
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,598
ah yes okay pardon me yes you're right

1095
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,960
is the the endpoint behavior

1096
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,640
i um i think uh tcp

1097
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,640
prague is headed for iccrg

1098
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:39,839
okay fair enough um

1099
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,760
and so maybe what we're trying to do is

1100
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:46,319
if if a bunch of stuff has

1101
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,839
a bunch of stuff has been moved to get

1102
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,279
the alpha restaurants into what is

1103
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,599
believed to be near final

1104
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,760
i guess focus in in the next few months

1105
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,040
needs to shift to the operations wrap

1106
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,760
and getting it adopted and and let's see

1107
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,480
see how fast we can how fast we can move

1108
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,160
that along

1109
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,520
sorry for interrupting you for a second

1110
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,200
um so

1111
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,799
we just heard that meet echo has just

1112
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,759
restarted server and that will kick

1113
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:11,759
everybody out

1114
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,200
out and then it might take a few minutes

1115
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,119
until everybody can rejoin

1116
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,759
so if the session suddenly ends that's

1117
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,079
what's happening just to let you know

1118
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,079
okay

1119
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,200
so i

1120
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,480
so it sounds like you you would really

1121
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,598
like like to see all four drafts in one

1122
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,640
package

1123
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,319
well i'm i'm kind of struggling to see

1124
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:36,319
i'm struggling they think of like the

1125
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:38,160
proper i mean i'm sorry this is a very

1126
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:42,720
like bureaucratic concern

1127
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:45,118
but i i'm struggling a little bit with

1128
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,879
this having a standard where there are

1129
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,640
kind of necessary safety requirements

1130
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,520
which are documented in an informational

1131
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:54,799
draft which obviously is a don ref

1132
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,400
um and i'm wondering if

1133
00:56:54,799 --> 00:57:02,000
if i'm wondering if something

1134
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,720
needs to be something like that i i hate

1135
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,160
to say this

1136
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,160
operational draft has to be standard

1137
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,078
track or some of it needs to move into

1138
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,680
the standards track documents

1139
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:15,280
because we can't they're experimental

1140
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,279
oh part b experimental okay very good uh

1141
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,480
pizza in the queue i'm gonna give the

1142
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,680
floor yeah just

1143
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,599
just because gory said in the chat room

1144
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,680
isn't the experimental status partly a

1145
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:29,359
need to get operational guidance

1146
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,359
and best practice for operators

1147
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,960
yeah there's a hair to be split here in

1148
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:41,839
that

1149
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,559
i think i actually reconnected am i

1150
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,558
talking to anybody

1151
00:59:53,359 --> 01:00:03,759
yeah i think everybody's back in

1152
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:06,400
except we lost uh our illustrious chairs

1153
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,400
there for a bit

1154
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:19,599
but yeah we'll be back

1155
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,599
you see the reowning gradually happening

1156
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,880
there's david

1157
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,480
hasn't turned on his mic yet but oh and

1158
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,720
gory too

1159
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,720
good

1160
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:43,839
ah i see i see gory as a chair now

1161
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,839
something must be working

1162
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,119
david so you're uh you cut that for me

1163
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,759
at least

1164
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,319
when you start saying it's a hair to be

1165
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:56,079
split

1166
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:59,680
uh here okay

1167
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:04,000
i think the hair to be split

1168
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:07,919
is between what is necessary to

1169
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,799
run the experiment safely

1170
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,079
how do what do operators do to prevent

1171
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:16,319
really bad things from happening

1172
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,680
which we need now during the experiment

1173
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,200
and then what are the operational

1174
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,319
guidelines

1175
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:25,279
to actually run l4s as a

1176
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:26,240
service as as a deployed service on a

1177
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,160
network which is

1178
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:29,279
which was what we want to learn from

1179
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:31,920
them from the

1180
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,400
uh results that experiment martin are

1181
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,400
you on

1182
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,799
yes i think

1183
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,720
so corey can you hear me now yes we can

1184
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:46,720
whoa hello everybody

1185
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:52,240
yeah i i think the the seeming

1186
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,839
disconnect between chairs is in that

1187
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,959
hair splitting area

1188
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:59,359
um we all

1189
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,319
talked about this as chairs and we we

1190
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:03,279
agreed that

1191
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:05,599
we there has to be ways to stop things

1192
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,640
going wrong

1193
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,559
and the question is uh really what level

1194
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,200
is that guidance that is it actual

1195
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,079
tooling is it is it just the method to

1196
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,038
turn it off

1197
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,119
um somewhere along that spectrum of

1198
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,520
different possibilities we have a

1199
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:23,280
informational document currently and we

1200
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,640
have what the guidance in the exp

1201
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,160
documents themselves

1202
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:28,480
and we have the experiment that's going

1203
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,759
on and we probably just have to get some

1204
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,960
better clarity about

1205
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,039
what's needed to complete the working

1206
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,480
group last call which parts of these are

1207
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,319
needed

1208
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:40,640
yeah and i think it's mostly the

1209
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,799
making sure really bad things don't

1210
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,520
happen by analogy i think of this as

1211
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,799
being

1212
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:50,079
guard rails along the side of the road

1213
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:54,000
um as opposed to advice to the driver to

1214
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,000
how to keep the car centered in the lane

1215
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,079
so uh by the way gloria thank you for

1216
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,760
pointing out this experimental i'm

1217
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,440
having some of the same types of issues

1218
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:07,920
everyone else is but

1219
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:11,520
i i i guess a better way of putting

1220
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:14,960
putting in it um

1221
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,720
i have a little difficulty with the the

1222
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,200
the working group requiring a certain

1223
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:22,319
document to safely judge

1224
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,759
the l4s package and then sending it to

1225
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,920
itf and the isg

1226
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:27,520
without that complete package and saying

1227
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,400
here this is good

1228
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:32,640
it seems a little problematic i mean

1229
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,280
especially if there were some issue with

1230
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,839
for some reason with the ops document

1231
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,880
that

1232
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:38,880
that held it up further

1233
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,520
but this but i think

1234
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,879
now that now that we have the ability to

1235
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,160
have a normal meaning again why don't we

1236
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,760
go back to the agenda

1237
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,680
and i think uh i think that the

1238
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,440
most need is to have a conversation

1239
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,440
about this and yeah and

1240
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,160
figure out where we're at it sounded

1241
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:02,400
independent of the process details

1242
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:06,399
the focus for the next meeting cycle

1243
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:09,839
needs to be on that

1244
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,440
operations draft as providing

1245
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,480
the guard rails to run to run the

1246
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:18,319
experiment and at the very least

1247
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,880
the the the next goal to shoot for is uh

1248
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,440
uh is working adoption of it all right

1249
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,839
so where

1250
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,839
were we when we when we started to be

1251
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:27,839
unable to do things

1252
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,240
david i suggest you show the agenda and

1253
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,359
we we remind people what we're trying to

1254
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:41,839
do

1255
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:41,839
um hang on

1256
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:53,520
okay so i think we got through the

1257
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,520
sctp drafts and

1258
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,909
[Music]

1259
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:09,839
alrighty

1260
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:23,839
come on

1261
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:42,000
no it's not that one um

1262
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,879
david have you got the agenda slide so

1263
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,200
we can

1264
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,559
check that you can present something uh

1265
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,680
about to do that

1266
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:54,319
um my turn to restart something um

1267
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:58,879
it lost track of acrobat for some reason

1268
01:05:54,319 --> 01:06:01,279
cool um so while you're

1269
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:05,839
getting ready pump the chair slides back

1270
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,839
up again

1271
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:09,680
i suspect the plan is that we go through

1272
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,359
the agenda in the same order we have

1273
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,359
written on the agenda slides so that

1274
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:15,598
people can

1275
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:16,880
try and regain synchronization which

1276
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,799
means we're going to start leaving

1277
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,000
presentations for the drafts

1278
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:24,030
i think udp options uh is

1279
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,109
next okay and

1280
01:06:24,030 --> 01:06:27,109
[Music]

1281
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,839
okay um

1282
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,960
all right i'm gonna okay uh corey why

1283
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:40,960
don't why don't you

1284
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,559
uh can you share materials i'm gonna

1285
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,079
have to drop out and restart as well

1286
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,079
something's going wrong in the browser

1287
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:01,839
no

1288
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:15,839
uh

1289
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:56,799
and david your audio is not on

1290
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:58,160
but your screen is up and showing

1291
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:01,520
there we go now you want to be able to

1292
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:05,598
hear me thank you pete

1293
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:10,160
okay okay so i've got the agenda up

1294
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:13,359
let me see if i can get um the slides up

1295
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:16,719
so david um and group i

1296
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:21,439
i think we covered 4.1 is that correct

1297
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:24,640
yes you're up on the uh

1298
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,358
udp options fine

1299
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,159
which would luck i've just shared yes i

1300
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,560
see that

1301
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,479
okay before i talk to this i'd like a

1302
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,920
quick update

1303
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:40,080
um for joe touch's

1304
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:44,799
work on the udp options draft itself

1305
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:48,399
so um

1306
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,479
joe is still working on this draft he

1307
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,399
has a new revision which he intends to

1308
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,399
upload after this meeting

1309
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,639
which will address the issues that were

1310
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,679
raised last iatf

1311
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,279
so the work is progressing but um we're

1312
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,480
still in need of a new

1313
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:07,600
revision um in the archive to see

1314
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:11,278
the results of joe's work

1315
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:21,839
um this does anybody have questions on

1316
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:21,839
udp options as a whole

1317
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:27,519
okay then i i'm i'm going to

1318
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,639
work with joe and make sure that joe

1319
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,159
uploads

1320
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:33,520
this new revision and

1321
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:35,519
there's going to be the changes that

1322
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,640
were requested so we'll expect those and

1323
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,199
then we need to have discussion on the

1324
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,640
list

1325
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:44,238
about these this particular slide deck

1326
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:47,759
is about the datagram plp mtud

1327
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,080
support for udp options um i'm going to

1328
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,719
give

1329
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,158
a little bit of history here because at

1330
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,198
the end of this side deck we're going to

1331
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:56,719
ask for a working group

1332
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:59,839
adoption so this

1333
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,000
particular draft is draft revision 3 the

1334
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:05,840
original work was done within

1335
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,719
the dplp mtud draft itself which is now

1336
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,560
published

1337
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,840
so what does the options draft now

1338
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,520
contain

1339
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:17,760
it contains the mechanisms for making

1340
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:20,000
udp options support dplp mtud

1341
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,840
and as such it provides connect

1342
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,560
confirmation of connectivity across a

1343
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,920
path

1344
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:28,800
something essential for dplp mtud

1345
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:31,199
it describes the sending of udp options

1346
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,239
for the probe packets that are used

1347
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:37,919
how to validate the path

1348
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,000
ptb handling and mainly the issue that

1349
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,840
ptb messages don't necessarily make use

1350
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,480
of space

1351
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,120
and the last but one line is the most

1352
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,040
important

1353
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,800
it's intended as a template for other

1354
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:53,440
drafts that need to describe

1355
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:57,199
how to make dplp mtud work

1356
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,599
i kind of expect that other protocols

1357
01:10:57,199 --> 01:11:01,440
will

1358
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:04,719
follow this specification we've produced

1359
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:05,519
in tsvwg and we'll need to write short

1360
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,880
drafts

1361
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:13,520
to say how their particular protocol

1362
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:16,159
works with the discovery of the pmtu

1363
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,920
and one thing that's important as i say

1364
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:20,000
this is that the actual draft is only

1365
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,199
seven pages plus appendices so it's a

1366
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,960
very short draft

1367
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:25,759
that just basically describes the extra

1368
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,679
machinery needed

1369
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,080
so it's short that means people probably

1370
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,840
can read it if they want to so i'm i'm

1371
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,880
inviting you to read it

1372
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:38,159
next slide please what's

1373
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:41,600
new since version two of this draft

1374
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,960
since revision two we've updated to

1375
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,480
refer to the published rfc we've rewrote

1376
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,920
the text on sending method

1377
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,159
on the probe construction path

1378
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,800
validation these are mainly just text

1379
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:52,879
edits

1380
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,480
to bring this in line and we've added

1381
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:59,360
security considerations so

1382
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:59,360
the draft is complete next slide please

1383
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,360
there is work to implement this we it'd

1384
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,919
be rather foolish to define a method and

1385
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:09,199
not

1386
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,440
try it so we have

1387
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:13,040
seen two implementations one is the

1388
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,639
scappy-based

1389
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:18,320
tooling and test suite basically to see

1390
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,239
if the mechanism works

1391
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:22,000
the other one is the freebsd kernel

1392
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,879
implementation which is available

1393
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,480
at the url below it's a individual

1394
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,840
contribution so

1395
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,599
it's a set of deltas to the actual

1396
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,679
kernel implementation

1397
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
please contact us if you're interested

1398
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:38,880
and this is tom's work

1399
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:41,040
tom plans to do more in this space

1400
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,199
tom would love to not be on his own so

1401
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,080
if you have any interest in this

1402
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,879
please contact tom or have a look at the

1403
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,880
implementation

1404
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,480
if you're doing your own implementation

1405
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,239
please tell us

1406
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:57,599
well we've written as much as we can so

1407
01:12:54,239 --> 01:13:01,280
yeah the next slide that's good

1408
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:02,159
um we we think the draft is more or less

1409
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,480
finished

1410
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:05,759
it's seven pages of text plus the pen

1411
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,678
dc's

1412
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:12,560
um we've got some chord which says this

1413
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,719
chord can be made to work within an

1414
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,800
operating system

1415
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:21,760
um to us this seems mature maybe to you

1416
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,480
it's time to read it so our question to

1417
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,840
the group is will tsvwg adopt

1418
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,959
the current topic um i'd imagine this

1419
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,480
was for publication

1420
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:36,159
as a ps if udp options is also a ps

1421
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:38,400
i would imagine this might be a ps um

1422
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:40,879
what do people think about this topic

1423
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:47,839
what people think about adoption

1424
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:47,840
i'll take questions

1425
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,360
oh

1426
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:57,759
i have a question can you hear me this

1427
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,759
is vidi

1428
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:06,400
so my question is um um

1429
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:09,599
we do dp dpl pmtud and

1430
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:12,639
quick and we use quick header itself

1431
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:16,719
to do that right and

1432
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:19,840
quick is built on top of udp so is this

1433
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,480
like mainly for you know protocols that

1434
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,520
use

1435
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:27,839
plain code plain udp

1436
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,760
um because i mean for udp is it even

1437
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,560
necessary to know the pattern to you

1438
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,840
because ip can do fragmentation

1439
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:39,360
so um for non reliable

1440
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,440
protocol that runs over utp

1441
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:42,880
um i'm a bit i haven't read the draft i

1442
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,480
apologize for that

1443
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,360
but i'm just you know like thinking

1444
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,360
about it right now

1445
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:54,000
okay i i i i'm trying to hear just a

1446
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:57,840
minute

1447
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,879
the udp options method is primarily

1448
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:08,880
aimed at transports

1449
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:11,280
which want to layer on top of udp

1450
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,320
so quick is one of those transports

1451
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:15,920
however quick

1452
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:19,519
has a dplp mtud

1453
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,040
module within it and

1454
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,440
it's clear that you don't want to do

1455
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,320
this twice so you shouldn't be using

1456
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:27,759
this udp

1457
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:29,759
options framework with quick

1458
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,280
um there are various reasons why you

1459
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,880
might not want to but particularly for

1460
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:36,159
dplp mtud

1461
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,800
this is this would be duplication of

1462
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:40,799
discovery probing it might well work

1463
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,800
that'd be an interesting um research

1464
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:44,960
project see if the two actually worked

1465
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,440
but there's no point in this

1466
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,560
and the extra traffic is certainly isn't

1467
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:51,360
wanted

1468
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,000
so categorically i'd say this is not for

1469
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,679
you

1470
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,719
using with quick there are other

1471
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:02,159
places where you might want to

1472
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,600
use udp as a transport

1473
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:05,839
and you might want to choose the right

1474
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,040
size maybe it's a udp

1475
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,600
tunnel encapsulation and maybe

1476
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:12,159
um it's just another protocol that's

1477
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,679
sending

1478
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,199
messages of a particular size and you

1479
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,600
want to know what size is the largest

1480
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:20,960
size you can use

1481
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,840
ip fragmentation is a different

1482
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,880
game and there are problems with ip

1483
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,800
fragmentation

1484
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:31,120
and c um 8900

1485
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,040
for why ip fragmentation is not

1486
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:36,640
necessarily the right solution

1487
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,280
so this is really adding that

1488
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:40,960
dplp mtud function that's already in

1489
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,280
quick

1490
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,199
to the udp options framework to allow

1491
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,759
other applications built on top of udp

1492
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:49,040
options

1493
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,000
to also have the same features did that

1494
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,120
help

1495
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,520
yeah um explain video you need to your

1496
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,519
microphone

1497
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:03,120
okay sorry can you hear me

1498
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:06,800
yeah there's an effort on your line

1499
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:09,760
um i'm sorry uh but it was just um

1500
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:10,640
yeah thank you for the explanation i was

1501
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,000
that that does

1502
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:18,080
make sense to use udp

1503
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:21,920
um for for for those kind of scenarios

1504
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:24,159
uh i had a follow-up question but um

1505
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,120
so this udp option can it be used for

1506
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,120
other things i

1507
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:29,440
didn't see what specific options are

1508
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:31,040
there but can it be used

1509
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,799
like is it generic option or is it

1510
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,600
specifically for dpl

1511
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,600
pmtod

1512
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:47,840
offering equivalent functions to tcp

1513
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:51,360
options so it's meant to be a

1514
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,120
generic set of functions which you can

1515
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,559
build upon when you build a

1516
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:58,480
udp based transport

1517
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:00,800
and most transports are not as

1518
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,040
sophisticated as quick

1519
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,239
um so they don't have as much machinery

1520
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,480
and this is a way to provide

1521
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:07,678
some common machinery to those other

1522
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:10,639
transports

1523
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,239
so you can negotiate other things um

1524
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,280
yeah udp options itself

1525
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:20,320
allows much more than dplp mtud

1526
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:21,920
yeah um there there is a draft on udp

1527
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,360
options in general

1528
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:29,120
um let me go find the name of that

1529
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,679
uh there if you look like on twg's main

1530
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,519
page

1531
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,840
there's a draft on edp options in

1532
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,800
general it may have expired at this

1533
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:41,840
point which is why

1534
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:41,840
why it's hard to find

1535
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:50,320
thank you very much thank you

1536
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,600
thank you all right my apologies for for

1537
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:56,880
for stumbling around again okay

1538
01:18:53,600 --> 01:19:00,159
um let's

1539
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:02,960
try the short hands tool and meet in uh

1540
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:05,679
uh in uh mate echo let me see if i can

1541
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,679
make this work

1542
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,840
um

1543
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,840
so

1544
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:32,439
[Applause]

1545
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,560
do

1546
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:39,760
okay we're trying trying to show a hands

1547
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,320
tool uh

1548
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:51,840
raise your hand if you've read the if

1549
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:51,840
you if you've read this draft

1550
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,320
okay i think about four people have read

1551
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,799
the draft

1552
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:15,280
um i'm going to say an adoption call

1553
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,920
seems appropriate as an except but we'll

1554
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,719
need will

1555
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,360
uh i think we should run that run run

1556
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:24,320
run that

1557
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,320
run that on the list um

1558
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,639
thanks david i i would i would take that

1559
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,799
a sensible input

1560
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:32,639
because people need to have read those

1561
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:36,000
seven pages before they

1562
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:39,120
do that adoption call thank you

1563
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:47,840
okay all right

1564
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:47,840
now where are we um

1565
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:58,320
okay i believe

1566
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,320
greg um we um go greg if you're on

1567
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,080
please turn your mic and say something

1568
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:08,080
we can go to the nqb draft

1569
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:13,599
hear me um

1570
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:20,480
i think so i heard hear me this is great

1571
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:23,760
okay cool let me go see if i can go get

1572
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,759
get that material up

1573
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,719
all right you should have a sliding

1574
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,000
screen and i've done this right

1575
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:36,239
all right thank you um

1576
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,520
move on to the next slide this is um

1577
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:41,280
discussing draft

1578
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:44,400
uh on the nqb per hot behavior

1579
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:48,639
non-cube building perhaps behavior

1580
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:51,519
just a quick update on the status

1581
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:54,159
so this was an adopted draft as of

1582
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:59,360
shortly after ietf105 so it's been

1583
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:59,360
adopted now for over a year um

1584
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:06,000
a couple of drafts

1585
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:06,638
um i talked about in previous ietf's

1586
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,360
graph zero

1587
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,360
graph one uh since the last ietf there

1588
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:14,080
have been two updates scrapto 2 and

1589
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:16,240
draft03

1590
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,760
with the additions and

1591
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:20,960
[Music]

1592
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,960
and changes listed here

1593
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:26,400
most of these items were things that

1594
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,920
were identified as

1595
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:32,799
tool necessary to align the draft with

1596
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:36,239
the requirements for php definitions

1597
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:39,520
that's provided in rfc 2475

1598
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:43,440
so i think those are all complete now

1599
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:45,280
um and

1600
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:47,599
we can move on well and then just a

1601
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:51,040
reminder the milestone here is to uh

1602
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:54,480
submit this as proposed standard rfc by

1603
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,679
february of next year so now we can move

1604
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,959
on

1605
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:04,639
um remaining work items

1606
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:08,880
for this draft so these i summarized

1607
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:10,880
also in an email to the mailing list um

1608
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:13,280
yesterday my time i don't know um where

1609
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:18,320
it landed in all of your inboxes but

1610
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:21,920
um uh there was some discussion on list

1611
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:25,120
about uh interconnection and

1612
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:28,560
uh the uh

1613
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:29,920
code point that the draft recommends

1614
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:33,199
currently is 42

1615
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,960
and uh and sort of some discussion about

1616
01:23:33,199 --> 01:23:37,199
how that

1617
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,840
works across interconnections with the

1618
01:23:37,199 --> 01:23:39,839
goal of this

1619
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:48,000
traffic marking being carried and across

1620
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:50,000
the internet but there might be some uh

1621
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,360
some issues with interconnection

1622
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,800
and the value 42 and so um

1623
01:23:53,360 --> 01:24:00,159
rudiger guide and uh dave and i had some

1624
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:04,159
off uh list discussion and came

1625
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:06,080
up with these seven items um

1626
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:07,599
most of them i think that between the

1627
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:10,239
three of us we had

1628
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:12,000
agreed seem like uh good next steps i

1629
01:24:10,239 --> 01:24:14,159
think there are a couple of items that

1630
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,199
maybe need some further discussion so

1631
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:19,759
let me run through these um

1632
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,759
uh quickly and all these have a little

1633
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,880
bit more detail in the

1634
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:28,080
email i sent to the mailing lists

1635
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,760
but uh um just

1636
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,760
go through one by one here so the first

1637
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,679
one is pretty simple um

1638
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,960
uh there's some terminology in the draft

1639
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:38,960
currently that

1640
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,639
talks about um standardized dscps

1641
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:43,360
and it was pointed out that that really

1642
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,960
is not um

1643
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:49,120
the the way that uh rfc 2474 lays

1644
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,960
things out and nor is it the way things

1645
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:54,320
have been done with dseps

1646
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:57,520
so far in the ietf in that um

1647
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,799
what are standardized are the phps and

1648
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:02,000
the dscps are

1649
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:04,719
are recommended by itf

1650
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,320
so well pretty simple terminology update

1651
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:09,520
there i think

1652
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,120
um second one is eliminate the

1653
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,000
implication that this server was not

1654
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,080
intended to be used

1655
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,370
end-to-end for some of the texts in the

1656
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,760
draft that

1657
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:21,519
[Music]

1658
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,520
indicates that um

1659
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:26,560
a lot of the different code points that

1660
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:30,559
are recommended in other graphs

1661
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:35,360
are not um carried end-to-end

1662
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:38,239
for various reasons and that goal of nqb

1663
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:39,759
was that it eliminates some of the

1664
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:41,040
hurdles or roadblocks that have

1665
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,719
prevented that

1666
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:44,480
and so it potentially could be carried

1667
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:47,120
end-to-end but

1668
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:47,839
in that language it uh maybe overstates

1669
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,400
things a bit

1670
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,639
and there's some clarification needed

1671
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,638
there

1672
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:59,920
the next one uh number three clarify

1673
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:03,760
aggregation of nqb traffic with default

1674
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:07,199
and discuss uh backbone networks

1675
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,800
um and this um

1676
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:10,480
i think has been discussed quite a bit

1677
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,280
on the more at least some on the mailing

1678
01:26:10,480 --> 01:26:15,120
list um

1679
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:16,719
and uh is not covered in as much detail

1680
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,320
as is needed in the draft

1681
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:23,600
the idea is that um

1682
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:27,199
the nqb phb can be supported

1683
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:29,280
in networks and um it provides a

1684
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:31,120
parallel cue that's at the same priority

1685
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:34,239
level as default

1686
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:37,199
um but just segregates

1687
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:38,959
nqb traffic from cue building traffic or

1688
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:41,759
default traffic

1689
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,199
but in networks that don't support the

1690
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,040
php

1691
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:46,638
that the nqb traffic should be

1692
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,159
aggregated with

1693
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:50,800
with default traffic and that's not

1694
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:52,799
really very clearly stated in the draft

1695
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,960
so

1696
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,800
i'd used to add that as it should and

1697
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:59,840
also in that case where

1698
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:03,360
the aggregations happening have

1699
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:07,120
the should that additionally that

1700
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:09,759
the nqb marking is preserved as well

1701
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,880
and then describe in a bit more detail

1702
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,080
where

1703
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,000
full nqb support is needed versus where

1704
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:17,120
aggregation with default traffic is

1705
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,840
likely fine

1706
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,960
uh here we're talking about um we have a

1707
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,520
set of

1708
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,320
use cases that that the draft outlines

1709
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,520
where

1710
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:30,400
support for nqb php

1711
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,400
would be pretty useful

1712
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,800
and the belief is that in backbone

1713
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,840
networks

1714
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,040
uh the aggregation with default is

1715
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,480
likely fine there so

1716
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:45,199
um that's one chunk of

1717
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,320
text that needs to be added to the draft

1718
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:50,000
item four

1719
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:51,199
um discuss interworking with um

1720
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,639
practices in place and some

1721
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,280
interconnects and backbones regarding

1722
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:55,440
dsep

1723
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:56,400
aggregation and so this is the one that

1724
01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:01,199
kind of kicked off

1725
01:27:56,400 --> 01:28:04,879
uh reuters comments um

1726
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:09,199
that in some interconnects

1727
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:11,440
um and and some networks particularly

1728
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:14,638
those that are running in pls

1729
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:17,519
there is a limit to the number of

1730
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:20,000
service classes that can be carried and

1731
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,960
so a lot of aggregation happens

1732
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,719
and a lot so a lot of aggregation of

1733
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,840
district code points happens into the

1734
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:28,000
service classes that get mapped into

1735
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,290
mpls

1736
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,350
um

1737
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:31,350
[Music]

1738
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:39,040
aggregations um and

1739
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:42,400
um although i don't think is

1740
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:44,880
documented in the rfc

1741
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,920
those aggregations typically it sounds

1742
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,040
like

1743
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:52,840
use essentially iprecedence

1744
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:56,719
bits in order to group

1745
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:59,920
dhcps into those aggregations

1746
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:02,239
and so if this traffic is

1747
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:03,040
intended to be aggregated with default

1748
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:06,080
the use of

1749
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:09,760
a zero zero zero xxx

1750
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:11,040
code point when sending traffic into

1751
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,239
those networks or across those

1752
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:15,280
interconnects

1753
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:17,519
would make it much easier for

1754
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,280
those networks to properly aggregate

1755
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:23,440
this traffic with

1756
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:26,480
uh with default and

1757
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:29,599
also make it easier for them to preserve

1758
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:31,120
the nqb marking so

1759
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,440
some discussion of that is needed in the

1760
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,440
draft

1761
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:43,280
item five um

1762
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:45,360
uh fix a mention of aggregating network

1763
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,040
control with nqb

1764
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,799
either remove it or provide sufficient

1765
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:52,159
contact warnings so

1766
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:54,080
um in the recent update there was a

1767
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:57,360
discussion about aggregating

1768
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,639
uh other code points with mqb

1769
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:03,519
including general context there was a

1770
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:05,280
set of examples around a motorbike

1771
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,679
motivated by a case where

1772
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,639
the network supports only two phps

1773
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,120
default and

1774
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,679
nqb and says well there are some of

1775
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,440
these

1776
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:17,120
other traffic class or service classes

1777
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:21,440
that could be

1778
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:25,040
aggregated including ef and va

1779
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:27,440
cs5 and some others that have

1780
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:28,560
the property that they're not

1781
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:31,120
[Music]

1782
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,719
not elastic and they're latency

1783
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:35,199
sensitive or loss sensitive

1784
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:36,239
network control falls into that category

1785
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,440
um

1786
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:41,440
but i'm just pointed out that that

1787
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:43,919
could be a problem if network network

1788
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:47,280
control is aggregated with any traffic

1789
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:50,239
um the stability the network could be

1790
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:51,840
difficult to maintain in cases where

1791
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:55,040
that traffic is delayed

1792
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:58,560
and i don't have a strong feeling on

1793
01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:01,679
this one it was intended as an example

1794
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:03,440
but unless

1795
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:04,960
some treatment of that is needed in the

1796
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,678
draft so maybe some discussion on that

1797
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:10,880
on the list

1798
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,880
would help guide the direction there

1799
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,879
then item six clean up the wi-fi section

1800
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,480
to recommend php compliance more

1801
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:24,560
strongly

1802
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:27,599
uh this section started out with

1803
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:31,040
um a uh

1804
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:33,120
discussion uh initial drafts

1805
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,719
started out with a discussion about

1806
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,040
existing wi-fi gear

1807
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:38,400
and the default mapping that that gear

1808
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:40,960
uses to map

1809
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,960
all of the different code points into

1810
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:47,520
wi-fi access categories

1811
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:49,760
and the selection of a

1812
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,040
recommended code point for nqb that

1813
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,080
allows that traffic

1814
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,560
and qb traffic to be aggregated into a

1815
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:57,679
or

1816
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:58,560
carried on in a access category that is

1817
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,600
separate from

1818
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,600
default so that

1819
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:10,159
so that it can not be

1820
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:13,360
queued alongside with q billing traffic

1821
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:14,799
and it also draft also mentions rfc 8325

1822
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:18,080
which defines

1823
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,639
a um a different mapping of code points

1824
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:21,519
into

1825
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,639
access categories but all that was was

1826
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:25,760
written

1827
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:27,280
under the belief that interoperation

1828
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,280
with these two

1829
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:30,719
mappings was the only thing that needed

1830
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:33,199
to be discussed

1831
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,960
i recently added a statement that

1832
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:38,239
indicates well actually

1833
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,960
a wi-fi device certainly could implement

1834
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:43,678
support for the php directly and

1835
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,520
completely support requirements

1836
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,199
and i think that that section on wi-fi

1837
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:51,040
really could be cleaned up to

1838
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:54,480
more emphasize um that that

1839
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:56,080
compliance aspect and um

1840
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,959
and then talk about these inner

1841
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,559
operation situations as

1842
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:06,080
um maybe a secondary aspect so

1843
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:08,639
i'm working there um and then

1844
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,400
the last point um this was brought up by

1845
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:13,920
rudiger

1846
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:16,799
since in some networks mqb and default

1847
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,520
should be aggregated since in all

1848
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:21,760
networks

1849
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:24,560
the php defines nqb to be

1850
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,360
given the same priority as default

1851
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,080
should these be

1852
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:28,719
should mqb be written as a php group

1853
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:31,840
alongs

1854
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:32,880
along with default that one i think we

1855
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:36,639
didn't

1856
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:39,440
reach agreement on off

1857
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:41,760
list so if anyone has thoughts on that

1858
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:45,360
that would be appreciated

1859
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:48,800
okay a few comments on this uh greg

1860
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:52,080
um working bottom up uh turning

1861
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,440
nqb into a php group with default should

1862
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:56,320
be a last resort

1863
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:57,678
um not a particularly not a good not a

1864
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,080
good thing to do unless we

1865
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,880
have no unless we have other choices

1866
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,880
right now

1867
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,199
my initial takes is not necessary i'll

1868
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,840
take a look i will take a look uh

1869
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:08,638
at the email and comment comment on the

1870
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,760
list

1871
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,520
uh the wi-fi section uh as we discussed

1872
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,159
saying off list we're gonna discuss on

1873
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:16,639
list

1874
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:18,719
this interacts strongly with the

1875
01:34:16,639 --> 01:34:22,880
selection of the default

1876
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,920
uh dscp use of 42 is motivated by wi-fi

1877
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:25,679
we're going to need an on-list

1878
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,199
discussion of why that's being done

1879
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:27,679
there's some comments in the chat room

1880
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:31,360
about

1881
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:32,320
uh uh the the wi-fi access class that it

1882
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,360
maps to income

1883
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:38,080
and uh consequences of that and then

1884
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:39,599
on and then numbers three and four it's

1885
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,800
going to take some careful

1886
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,159
crafting of text because in essence

1887
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:48,159
where we're trying to go

1888
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:50,799
is that in access networks such as wi-fi

1889
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:51,679
there's a dscp that appears make a lot

1890
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,679
of sense

1891
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,840
uh but once you get away from the access

1892
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:58,719
networks it looks like a different dscp

1893
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,920
makes a lot of sense

1894
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,560
like i haven't seen anything too

1895
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,560
embarrassing

1896
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:08,239
okay thanks for that clarification yeah

1897
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,639
i think what's a bit unclear to me on

1898
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,959
the

1899
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:12,400
the core networking of backbone networks

1900
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:15,440
aspect is

1901
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:18,638
um is that fairly universal

1902
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:20,960
that the use of a zero zero zero xxx

1903
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:23,119
code point would be preferred or is that

1904
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,639
in some networks and not others

1905
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:30,960
um and

1906
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:30,960
so um yeah it's

1907
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:35,119
we're gonna have a lot more

1908
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:42,000
let's see operator survey survey is

1909
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:45,040
tough we can try to do what we can

1910
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:47,440
i mean the the general uh problem that

1911
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,080
that uh mps background operators are up

1912
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:51,519
against

1913
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:54,840
is that there is there is very

1914
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,600
limited room in the mpls label for

1915
01:35:54,840 --> 01:36:00,960
uh for what amount to

1916
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:04,719
uh uh uh d

1917
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:08,719
dscp values and that's

1918
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:10,400
that plus of the the widespread practice

1919
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:14,880
of bleaching dhcp

1920
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:14,879
zero at network network interconnects

1921
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:20,239
interacts with three and four and may

1922
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:24,959
make some of the desire to reserve the

1923
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:27,519
nqb marking uh some wishful thinking

1924
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,639
okay on the next slide i think we have a

1925
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:32,960
lot more this to

1926
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:36,400
discuss on the list okay

1927
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:39,280
ah here we go yeah so this was uh

1928
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,040
to get into that a little bit um maybe

1929
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:44,000
um

1930
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,480
at least provide what the rationale was

1931
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,080
for

1932
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:49,599
for recommending 42 and um

1933
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:52,080
but as you said some of this discussion

1934
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:56,639
probably needs to take place on the list

1935
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:56,639
um so um

1936
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:01,759
one of the big rationales for

1937
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:05,280
recommending dhcp 42

1938
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:08,239
is that for the

1939
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:10,639
you know the end host which is marking

1940
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:13,040
its traffic as nqb

1941
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:13,679
yet having the best uh a priori

1942
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:15,840
knowledge

1943
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,800
as to what its sending behavior is and

1944
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:18,719
so

1945
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,960
having the best knowledge as to whether

1946
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:23,760
it's appropriate to mark that traffic in

1947
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,760
qb or not

1948
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:32,880
in many cases that end host is

1949
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:36,000
launching traffic into a network

1950
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:39,280
where there is no opportunity for

1951
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,280
a network element to remap that dhcp

1952
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:45,119
into another value

1953
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:48,639
prior to an important link where

1954
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:51,920
where nqb treatment

1955
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:52,400
or pseudo nqb treatment is is possible

1956
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:56,080
and that's

1957
01:37:52,400 --> 01:38:00,239
a wi-fi link um

1958
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:03,600
and um we noted that

1959
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:07,599
um there is there are applications today

1960
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:10,880
that are uh compatible with nqb

1961
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:14,239
that already select a code point that

1962
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:17,199
in the default mapping of diffserv code

1963
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:19,919
points to wi-fi access categories

1964
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:21,919
select a code point that maps to the

1965
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:23,600
video access category

1966
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,040
or in some cases the voice access

1967
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,480
category

1968
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:28,560
and

1969
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:28,559
[Music]

1970
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,799
and even beyond that the applications

1971
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:36,879
that do that today

1972
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:38,400
uh future applications that can um

1973
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,080
uh that would that would like to make

1974
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:43,440
use of nqb

1975
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,840
uh in you know across the network

1976
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:48,159
would also presumably want to have their

1977
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:51,600
traffic huge separately from

1978
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:54,638
uh best effort traffic on wi-fi links

1979
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,719
and so would similarly want to choose a

1980
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,920
district code point that in these

1981
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,320
defaults default

1982
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,600
wi-fi networks maps to a separate access

1983
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:04,000
category from

1984
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:05,199
um from best ever so the video access

1985
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,679
category is the

1986
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:09,678
is the one um that would be useful for

1987
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:13,119
that

1988
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:16,880
so uh the

1989
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:17,599
belief here is that if we were to choose

1990
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:19,520
a different

1991
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:20,800
recommended code point one that does not

1992
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,600
map

1993
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:25,119
into the video access category in this

1994
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:27,360
default mapping

1995
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:29,759
that that would go unused that

1996
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:34,159
applications would instead

1997
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:36,320
uh fall back to a a non-recommended code

1998
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:39,599
point for this

1999
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:44,639
and whether whether that's cs5 or

2000
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:46,639
ef or cs7 in some cases

2001
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:50,800
that that would continue to be used as a

2002
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:50,800
as opposed to the recommended code point

2003
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:56,320
a secondary rationale for this value 42

2004
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,280
is that

2005
01:39:56,320 --> 01:40:00,799
it's in the family with ef and va and

2006
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,380
cs5

2007
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,239
and so

2008
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:06,800
[Music]

2009
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:08,718
access network technologies that might

2010
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,920
want to aggregate

2011
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:15,040
those uh four code points together

2012
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,239
uh can do that with a mask on the

2013
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:19,360
diffser code point

2014
01:40:16,239 --> 01:40:23,759
um looking for the pattern one zero one

2015
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:27,190
don't care don't care zero

2016
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:29,040
so that's um you know the rationale that

2017
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:32,159
[Music]

2018
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:34,960
we have for uh 42

2019
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:36,320
and then as discussed a few minutes ago

2020
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:37,920
there is some rationale

2021
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,599
for interconnections and backbone

2022
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,719
routers where

2023
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,760
this value zero zero zero xxx would be a

2024
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:47,199
more

2025
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:50,159
easily uh used

2026
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:51,678
okay all right let's take a comment from

2027
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:53,679
sebastian and then i think

2028
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:55,199
most the rest of the discussion this is

2029
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:57,040
going to need to go to the list

2030
01:40:55,199 --> 01:41:00,000
sebastian go ahead you'll need to click

2031
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,000
on your mic icon

2032
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,760
can you hear me yes does that work yes

2033
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:09,040
it's working

2034
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:10,480
anybody hear me yes we can hear you can

2035
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:12,560
you hear us

2036
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:13,599
and this is all garbage i'll try

2037
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:15,760
nevertheless

2038
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,360
so i like the draft a lot but i have

2039
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:19,760
concerns about the default

2040
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:22,559
wi-fi mapping because any network out

2041
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:25,440
there is going to up prioritize

2042
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,520
uh nqb packets without having all of the

2043
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:30,000
measures in place that the draft states

2044
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,600
that make nqb safe to deploy

2045
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,199
what i recommend is using a dc dscp that

2046
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,600
maps

2047
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:38,638
out of the zero zero zero category and

2048
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,560
then instruct

2049
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,440
participating mqb aware access points to

2050
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:46,000
reprogram

2051
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:48,159
the quality of service map so that the

2052
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:51,840
access points can still use

2053
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:55,119
the zero zero zero xxx rdscp

2054
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:57,520
and still get mapped into the acvi

2055
01:41:55,119 --> 01:41:58,960
this is possible and this is a clean

2056
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,159
opt-in solution where

2057
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:03,679
none of the unsuspecting parties will

2058
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:07,920
accidentally swamp

2059
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,920
air time from their neighbors that's my

2060
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,360
point

2061
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:20,400
okay um so

2062
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:23,679
um i think that the the main

2063
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:25,920
issue with taking that that path

2064
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,440
is the one that's listed on on the slide

2065
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,840
here

2066
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,839
that

2067
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:37,520
applications that today

2068
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:40,000
already map their traffic into

2069
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,840
the video access category or as

2070
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
indicated some cases the voice access

2071
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:46,880
category

2072
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:48,639
would continue to want to do so even on

2073
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:51,360
networks that don't support

2074
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,360
the nqb

2075
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,960
and and don't opt in with this with the

2076
01:42:56,080 --> 01:43:00,239
quas map

2077
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:04,880
as you're suggesting and so i think

2078
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:04,879
the end result there will be that

2079
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:12,320
no applications use the nqb code point

2080
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:14,320
because it doesn't provide the benefit

2081
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:17,440
that those applications are

2082
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:19,199
are wanting to achieve on on the wi-fi

2083
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,799
link

2084
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:23,199
okay i think we need to take further

2085
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:24,639
discussion of this and what to do about

2086
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:26,400
the list is it's going to be

2087
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:28,880
it's going to be subtle as indicated by

2088
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:32,559
the amount of text on the slide

2089
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:34,880
all right so i think it says address

2090
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,000
above topics on this please and revise

2091
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:39,840
draft uh

2092
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,840
in the near future

2093
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:46,239
any further comments on this before we

2094
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:46,239
switch topics

2095
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,000
okay thank you greg um

2096
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:07,840
marcus are you on

2097
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:11,920
marcus go ahead turn on your audio and

2098
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:16,000
uh we'll flip slides for you

2099
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:19,119
hello can you hear me yes we can ah

2100
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,199
very good so hi everyone

2101
01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:22,559
or from a german facility good morning

2102
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:26,159
everyone so it's 11

2103
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:28,400
40 german time fairly reasonable

2104
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:30,638
uh time to present you something around

2105
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:32,480
multiples dccp

2106
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:34,400
uh as you probably all know we have

2107
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,320
three drafts

2108
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:41,679
published in the tsvwg however

2109
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:44,239
this time it's less on an

2110
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,800
update regarding the craft itself it's

2111
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:48,239
more

2112
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:51,199
on our practical experience with our

2113
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:53,759
multi-path dcp ue implementation next

2114
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,759
slide please

2115
01:44:54,639 --> 01:44:58,639
yes so first start with the figure on

2116
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,880
the right side

2117
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,040
on what the prototype implementation is

2118
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,639
about so maybe starting on the top of

2119
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:07,600
the figure above the dashed

2120
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,480
line um so we implemented multiples this

2121
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:13,280
is the

2122
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:15,919
multiple thesis between uh android phone

2123
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:17,840
here it is called ue user equipment and

2124
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:20,639
on the right side an aggregation point

2125
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:23,679
so we leverage your multi-part gccp for

2126
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,000
providing multi-path capabilities for at

2127
01:45:23,679 --> 01:45:26,880
least

2128
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:29,840
udp traffic complementing them existing

2129
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:32,320
multi-pass tcp

2130
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:33,040
but it's not restricted to udp traffic

2131
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:35,759
it can

2132
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:36,880
even transport ip traffic or even layer

2133
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:40,320
2.

2134
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:44,320
um so the aggregation point then

2135
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:45,519
is the interface to the internet so we

2136
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,719
provide them multiple

2137
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:50,000
over cellular access and wireless and or

2138
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:52,880
fixed access

2139
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,239
if you look uh below the dashed line

2140
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:56,719
into the engine room

2141
01:45:54,239 --> 01:45:58,638
so what's implemented in the specific

2142
01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:00,400
devices i i mentioned

2143
01:45:58,639 --> 01:46:01,760
the user equipment and the aggregation

2144
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:04,960
point

2145
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:08,159
um you can see that we

2146
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:09,440
encapsulate any traffic coming from

2147
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:12,159
applications

2148
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,638
through a virtual network interface into

2149
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:16,400
the

2150
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:19,679
dccp flows or dccp tunnels

2151
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:20,080
we apply a scheduling scheme it's a

2152
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:22,800
model

2153
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:25,360
modular one on the receiver side we have

2154
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:28,159
a modular reordering scheme to bring

2155
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:29,599
packets in order again and then forward

2156
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:31,759
it to the internet

2157
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:33,679
we also employ a path manager all the

2158
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:38,000
stuff i will explain

2159
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:41,679
later on in my presentation um let's go

2160
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:45,199
through the points on on the left side

2161
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:48,639
so as i said we

2162
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:53,440
use here the multi-pass gccp

2163
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:57,040
extension which is available as draft

2164
01:46:53,440 --> 01:47:00,320
and that one we have implemented in the

2165
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:02,080
linux kernel the architecture comprises

2166
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,920
a modular scheduler

2167
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:07,360
and reordering scheme as i already

2168
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:10,880
mentioned that i will explain later on

2169
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:14,400
per part we employ a bccp

2170
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:18,400
tunnel as you all know the dccp as such

2171
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:20,879
provides us the path characteristics by

2172
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:23,360
using congestion control

2173
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,360
on the other hand dccp is unreliable so

2174
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:28,639
that is the difference to

2175
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:31,839
tcp here and

2176
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:35,840
this encapsulation of traffic

2177
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:37,760
into multi-pass dccp that is part of a

2178
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:40,800
draft we call multipath

2179
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:43,199
framework so please look into that if

2180
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:45,520
you if you need more information

2181
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:47,360
but it's it's fairly easy so we just

2182
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:50,400
provide encapsulation

2183
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:52,880
into the multipost gccp protocol

2184
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,799
and last but not least referring to our

2185
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,159
last trough we have available

2186
01:47:54,800 --> 01:48:01,199
um that the dccp udp header conversion

2187
01:47:58,159 --> 01:48:03,920
that is an overhead free conversion

2188
01:48:01,199 --> 01:48:06,719
just for the sake of metal boxes which

2189
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:11,280
does not allow dccp forwarding

2190
01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:14,480
or part through for that we

2191
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:18,480
convert any dccp traffic into

2192
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:21,759
udp on when we transport this traffic

2193
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:25,199
so middle boxes uh which allow udp

2194
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:27,920
traffic will also allow our traffic

2195
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:30,000
in that case and then we reconvert on

2196
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:33,840
receiver side

2197
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,840
next slide please

2198
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:39,679
okay um coming a little bit to

2199
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:41,519
the deployment settings so as i already

2200
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:45,199
mentioned it's part of

2201
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:46,960
the linux kernel code we implemented the

2202
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:48,960
multi-pass dccp and also the

2203
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:52,159
encapsulation for hamburgers

2204
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:54,719
uh loadable uh kernel modules

2205
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:55,599
we deployed this setup over commercial

2206
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,960
network

2207
01:48:55,600 --> 01:49:02,880
so it's it's not part of a lab setup

2208
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:05,360
or a local setup it's really commercial

2209
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:08,080
and the aggregation point is located in

2210
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:13,280
a cloud internet server for that

2211
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:16,400
scenario the ue specifications are

2212
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:18,880
google pixel 4 and

2213
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:21,519
using android version 10. so the

2214
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,440
multi-pass d60p is running

2215
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,040
in the linux kernel where the android

2216
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:28,559
based on

2217
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:30,239
and we have also some uh implementation

2218
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:31,119
then in the android version 10 network

2219
01:49:30,239 --> 01:49:33,040
manager

2220
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:34,719
to bring up the multi-pass tcp and all

2221
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:37,679
that stuff

2222
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:38,320
on server side we are using the power

2223
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,360
edge

2224
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,559
server it's quite powerful one we

2225
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:45,920
operate

2226
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:50,639
at the german cloud provider

2227
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:55,040
and as operation system we use debian

2228
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:56,000
stretch both ue and server are based on

2229
01:49:55,040 --> 01:50:01,599
linux kernel

2230
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,599
version 4.14 next slide please

2231
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:10,480
yeah so yeah i jump into

2232
01:50:07,199 --> 01:50:12,559
a probably new topic for some of you um

2233
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:15,759
so starting with the title prepared for

2234
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:19,360
3gbp 80 triple s udp or ip support so

2235
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,719
2gb p80 triple s um that is something

2236
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,598
which is defined

2237
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:26,080
as part of the 5g specification within

2238
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,199
3gpp and 82.s is exactly what we have

2239
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,960
seen in the figures

2240
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:33,360
before where multi-path or

2241
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,800
multi-connectivity is provided to

2242
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:40,000
mobile handsets by the 5g core where the

2243
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:42,239
aggregation point is part of the 5g core

2244
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,760
um that uh that's why i want to point in

2245
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:46,718
this slide

2246
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:47,840
that multi-part gccp or the prototype we

2247
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:51,199
have developed

2248
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:54,400
is exactly fitting

2249
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:57,839
into the 80 triple s scope um

2250
01:50:54,400 --> 01:51:00,000
so explaining you what is 80 triple s

2251
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:01,760
that is axis traffic and then we have

2252
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,760
the first as that is steering that

2253
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:06,239
allows for path election whenever we

2254
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:09,679
communicate with the internet

2255
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:12,879
so it's a or decision uh either to use

2256
01:51:09,679 --> 01:51:15,119
um cellular or wi-fi then we have the

2257
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:18,080
switching so we have to decide for one

2258
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:18,960
access or for one path but there is the

2259
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:21,920
opportunity

2260
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,560
to seamlessly switch to the other axis

2261
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,000
and

2262
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,000
we have the splitting support that is

2263
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,760
the well-known path aggregation also

2264
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,239
provided for example by multi-pass

2265
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:33,679
tcp where we can leverage the capacities

2266
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:37,119
of both axises or paths

2267
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:39,520
so all these 3s

2268
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:40,719
are enabled in our setup in our

2269
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:43,119
multiparse tcp

2270
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:44,400
setup by the combination of scheduling

2271
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:46,080
reordering and

2272
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,159
path management as you have seen in the

2273
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:51,199
figures before

2274
01:51:48,159 --> 01:51:53,199
so the path manager that the one uh

2275
01:51:51,199 --> 01:51:55,440
which detects uh local network

2276
01:51:53,199 --> 01:51:56,080
interfaces and initiates connection on

2277
01:51:55,440 --> 01:51:58,719
on ue

2278
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:59,920
side again that is similar to multi-pass

2279
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:01,599
tcp

2280
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,960
and that one enables at least the

2281
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:05,920
steering

2282
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,719
um but it also reacts to changes in the

2283
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:08,719
network

2284
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:10,639
so when the interface status change

2285
01:52:08,719 --> 01:52:13,119
appear addresses whatever

2286
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:15,119
then path manager is responsible for

2287
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:18,400
trigger the switching

2288
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:21,519
the scheduling that uh the

2289
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:24,638
entity which select the subflow

2290
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:26,880
through which data is to be sent that

2291
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,480
execute the steering and switching

2292
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:31,599
functionality

2293
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,799
but it also allows uh for executing

2294
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:34,880
splitting

2295
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,560
uh while it distributes traffic among

2296
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,159
the subflows

2297
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,679
last but not least we have the

2298
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:42,239
reordering and

2299
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,159
uh that we consider as a very important

2300
01:52:42,239 --> 01:52:47,119
if we talk about

2301
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:48,159
multi-path for unreliable traffic as it

2302
01:52:47,119 --> 01:52:50,960
is with udp

2303
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:51,759
or with ip traffic if we encapsulate

2304
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,199
this

2305
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:59,520
um then we have to to bring the packets

2306
01:52:55,199 --> 01:53:02,320
again into the order they originated

2307
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,040
we consider this very very important

2308
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:06,159
because we

2309
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:09,519
cannot rely on the service

2310
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:10,320
or transport capabilities to to deal

2311
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:12,159
with an

2312
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:13,440
unordered stream which is pretty likely

2313
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:15,679
if we apply multipath

2314
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:17,519
and we have accesses with different

2315
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:20,080
latencies and so on

2316
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:21,840
uh so reordering compensates overall

2317
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,519
packets cramping introduced by different

2318
01:53:21,840 --> 01:53:25,520
parts latencies and

2319
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:27,840
that's again supports the splitting use

2320
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,840
case

2321
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:37,040
to enable all these 3ss

2322
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:38,639
in the atroci that requires

2323
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:41,280
as well the transmission of signaling

2324
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:44,239
information so we achieved this by

2325
01:53:41,280 --> 01:53:46,239
implementing multipath options defined

2326
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:50,159
in our multi-pass tccp

2327
01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:53,280
draft like mp sec for sequencing mprtt

2328
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:54,000
for transmitting rtt information but

2329
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,000
also new

2330
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,119
ones we have already implemented in our

2331
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:00,400
prototype but

2332
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:02,080
not updated already uh in the multicast

2333
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,400
tcp track that is something what we

2334
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:05,840
would

2335
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:08,239
but we will do after this iatf

2336
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,920
that is for example mppath info and mp

2337
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:12,879
remove path

2338
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:12,880
next slide please

2339
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:19,199
yeah so the uh scheduling schemes we

2340
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,320
have implemented are

2341
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:25,598
in line with a 80 triple s

2342
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:29,679
so in the atss specification

2343
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:32,960
in the finalized release 16

2344
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:34,960
where atss was defined first

2345
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,000
but also in the starting phase now for

2346
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:40,000
the next release

2347
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,239
17 different

2348
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,719
steering or scheduling options are

2349
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:48,239
defined or discussed

2350
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:50,080
and we provide most of this scheduling

2351
01:54:48,239 --> 01:54:51,598
options as well in our prototype that is

2352
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:54,080
cheapest pipe first

2353
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:55,280
that's a prior priority based mechanism

2354
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,840
which allows

2355
01:54:55,280 --> 01:55:00,639
the operator or the uae to assign a cost

2356
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:03,440
value to each network path

2357
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:05,840
that means we send data on the cheapest

2358
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:08,559
flow whenever possible

2359
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,960
um and if the congestion window then of

2360
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:11,520
the

2361
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,560
cheapest path is full or exceeded it

2362
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,679
sends on the next

2363
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:19,920
available part so that is the splitting

2364
01:55:15,679 --> 01:55:21,520
use case we also implemented something

2365
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,840
in our scheduler

2366
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:26,080
which allows to give equal costs to

2367
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,880
accesses in that case we prefer the part

2368
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:30,559
with the

2369
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:30,560
lowest rtt

2370
01:55:31,119 --> 01:55:35,839
we support handover use case so that is

2371
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,598
more or less similar to the cheapest

2372
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:39,840
pipe first principle

2373
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:40,639
however aggregation disabled in that

2374
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,080
case

2375
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:47,280
so we send data on the prioritized path

2376
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:50,000
as long as the dccp panel is available

2377
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:52,159
for this particular access or path and

2378
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,480
if the dccp tunnel is broken

2379
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:55,679
it sends on the next available power so

2380
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:59,119
that is switching and

2381
01:55:55,679 --> 01:56:01,840
it's seamless uh we also support

2382
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:02,880
uh an academic or uh scheduler that is

2383
01:56:01,840 --> 01:56:05,040
the round-robin one

2384
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:07,040
which distribute the traffic equally i

2385
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:09,760
think i have not to explain this further

2386
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:11,280
we also support fixed ratio and

2387
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:14,320
redundant i hope

2388
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,719
i hope they are self-explanatory next

2389
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:19,920
slide please

2390
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:23,520
um reordering options there we support

2391
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:26,960
three uh in the moment that is active

2392
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:30,800
fixed with fixed refers here to

2393
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:34,400
a static timeout

2394
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:36,480
until we assume a packet to be lost and

2395
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:37,598
then process the next packets on

2396
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,799
receiver side

2397
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:43,840
we have it active adaptive which

2398
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:46,880
tries to um

2399
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,880
to figure out or

2400
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:50,159
which make this static time out from the

2401
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:52,560
previous active fixed

2402
01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:54,638
example make this adaptive based on the

2403
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:57,360
rtt or latency difference information we

2404
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:59,599
have available

2405
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,400
and also we have delay equalization

2406
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:02,960
function

2407
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:04,638
that is strictly speaking spoken not a

2408
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,400
reordering option

2409
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,400
it just tries to

2410
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:14,639
to delay packets on the faster path

2411
01:57:11,840 --> 01:57:16,000
um by the amount of of latency

2412
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:18,880
difference

2413
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,880
next slide please

2414
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:26,719
and that is now one of our results

2415
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:29,840
we were able to generate last week

2416
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:32,000
so that was with the uh switch

2417
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:34,239
that is in the switching scenario where

2418
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,480
we set up a real

2419
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:42,080
skype video call um and

2420
01:57:38,480 --> 01:57:43,839
we activated the handover scapular which

2421
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:45,280
allows for the seamless handover from

2422
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,239
one axis to the other

2423
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,960
priority was set on the wi-fi part and

2424
01:57:48,239 --> 01:57:51,919
um

2425
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:52,800
at 37 seconds you see it on the right

2426
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:56,480
side in the

2427
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:58,639
in the figure the wi-fi axis

2428
01:57:56,480 --> 01:58:00,320
was broken and there was a seamless

2429
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:03,920
handover from the wi-fi

2430
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:07,440
to the cellular to the lte

2431
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:10,800
access in this case and

2432
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:14,159
the skype call remain

2433
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:18,800
active and that is exactly what we

2434
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:21,040
expected to see so

2435
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,400
during and after the switching the video

2436
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:25,760
call remains

2437
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:27,519
active that i think is a is a great

2438
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:30,400
outcome here

2439
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:30,400
next slide please

2440
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:36,800
um as i said our

2441
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,320
prototype also allows the splitting use

2442
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,560
case where we aggregate

2443
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:43,440
the capacities of accesses so there we

2444
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:45,280
have earlier results available

2445
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:47,440
the splitting functionality as i said is

2446
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,519
supported in the prototype

2447
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:51,360
we have this various schedulers with

2448
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:53,760
deal with a splitting use case and

2449
01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:55,440
on the right side you see we can combine

2450
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:58,719
capacities from the wi-fi

2451
01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:01,360
and the lte however we have to conclude

2452
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:03,040
while first results gives encouraging

2453
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:04,960
results it was identified that the

2454
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:07,040
splitting performance has dependencies

2455
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:09,599
on congestion control reordering

2456
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:12,960
scheduling rtt ratio

2457
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:16,639
though there's still something to do and

2458
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:19,920
you will find more information in

2459
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:21,440
our presentation at this uh ietf 109

2460
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,320
iccrg session

2461
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:24,320
next slide please

2462
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:29,280
um i i think that for the sake of time i

2463
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,960
will skip this

2464
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:34,719
just making it short here we also

2465
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,239
implemented new congestion control

2466
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,199
schemes for dcc

2467
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:40,080
for dccp in that case it is bbr version

2468
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,759
one

2469
01:59:40,080 --> 01:59:44,400
which we make available and with that we

2470
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:48,320
have a very good experience in terms of

2471
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,320
multi-part performance next slide please

2472
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,559
so coming to the conclusion native

2473
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:54,480
android mobile phone implementation as i

2474
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,880
have presented today

2475
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:58,638
tested over commercial networks reveals

2476
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,840
functionality for path election and

2477
01:59:58,639 --> 02:00:01,599
seamless handover

2478
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:03,119
the splitting aggregation is supported

2479
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:04,719
by design but needs further

2480
02:00:03,119 --> 02:00:06,719
investigation

2481
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:07,840
next steps uh we will update the

2482
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:10,840
multiparse ccp

2483
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:12,080
draft according to our current prototype

2484
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:13,679
development

2485
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:15,840
deutsche telekom internally we have

2486
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:18,880
initiated the process to publish

2487
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:20,480
uh the multi-pass tccp implementation

2488
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:22,080
open source

2489
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:23,519
i think that is quite interesting for

2490
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:26,159
you all

2491
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:27,520
and we will continue research on the

2492
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:32,239
multi-past dssp

2493
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:34,960
splitting use case to together with our

2494
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:36,000
academic partners culture university and

2495
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:39,119
city university of

2496
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,320
london and what i would like to ask you

2497
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:43,040
today is

2498
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:45,679
do you think that our drafts are ready

2499
02:00:43,040 --> 02:00:45,679
for adoption

2500
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:58,400
corey go ahead

2501
02:00:54,480 --> 02:01:00,000
hello i'm yes i'm wondering

2502
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,440
uh whether i'm understanding this

2503
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:04,880
correctly um

2504
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:06,879
is the network path you're considering

2505
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,040
scheduling packets at the packet level

2506
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:12,320
without any flow awareness at all

2507
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:15,440
or is this behaving like ecmp would and

2508
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:16,639
trying to stickily send the same flow

2509
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:19,678
along the same

2510
02:01:16,639 --> 02:01:22,080
path because these look like different

2511
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:22,880
problem spaces and i'm curious as to

2512
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:26,400
which you

2513
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:27,199
you're looking at and why maybe can we

2514
02:01:26,400 --> 02:01:31,040
go back to

2515
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:31,040
the figure in the first slide

2516
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:43,440
so uh yeah thank you

2517
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:45,920
um so what we do is we encapsulate

2518
02:01:43,440 --> 02:01:45,919
traffic

2519
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:52,239
into the multi-pass tcp framework so it

2520
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,320
at this point it is independent if this

2521
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:55,678
udp is at ip traffic as a layer 2

2522
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:59,199
traffic that doesn't matter

2523
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:01,599
what you leverage here is the uh

2524
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:03,360
dccp flows we have established between

2525
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:07,040
ue and aggregation point

2526
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:09,360
and into this flows we encapsulate

2527
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:10,960
the traffic we get obviously we receive

2528
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:14,000
from the applications and are sent

2529
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,920
through this virtual network interface

2530
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,719
and scheduling decisions are then based

2531
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:21,520
on the dccp flow informations

2532
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,560
we have between ue and aggregation part

2533
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,199
so do all the

2534
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:26,480
ip packets in the same ip floor follow

2535
02:02:25,199 --> 02:02:29,440
the same

2536
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:29,440
scheduler decision

2537
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,880
uh so okay that that depends so uh

2538
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:37,759
currently in our prototype

2539
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:39,199
that's the case however uh we could

2540
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:42,239
implement a logic

2541
02:02:39,199 --> 02:02:44,559
uh to employ different schedulers based

2542
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:45,199
on ip information for example or even on

2543
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:49,599
application

2544
02:02:45,199 --> 02:02:49,598
service information whatever yeah

2545
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:54,480
yeah okay i didn't find it in the draft

2546
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:56,159
so i need to read more to figure out

2547
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:58,400
what exactly is going on here i think

2548
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,400
this

2549
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:02,799
this is quite an important thing for me

2550
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:05,280
to understand so i i would

2551
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,360
i will read again and i would appreciate

2552
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:09,040
more clarity

2553
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,480
however i think that is more related

2554
02:03:09,040 --> 02:03:12,800
than to the framework craft

2555
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:14,080
it's not to the multi-party draft as

2556
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,960
such

2557
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:17,840
and what our prototype would support

2558
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:21,280
already today

2559
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:25,199
is to set up different

2560
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:26,719
uh mp dccp tunnel connections so that we

2561
02:03:25,199 --> 02:03:28,879
expose different virtual network

2562
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:29,520
interfaces in the ue and the aggregation

2563
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:32,639
point

2564
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,520
and use this to separate ipflows then

2565
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:36,320
with different

2566
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:38,000
scheduling and or even reordering

2567
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:40,239
schemes

2568
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,239
okay

2569
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,960
right okay so i i think probably we

2570
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:46,638
should take

2571
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,239
other questions on the presentation if

2572
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:50,000
we can

2573
02:03:48,239 --> 02:03:53,440
is there anyone got any questions on the

2574
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,440
presentation before we talk about

2575
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,840
adoption

2576
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:13,040
okay i don't see any at this moment

2577
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:16,960
um i have a few questions on the

2578
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:18,239
adoption question to the working group

2579
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,880
as a whole

2580
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:21,519
i mean one of the things i'm interested

2581
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:25,119
in

2582
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:27,280
is whether people have read these drafts

2583
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:28,400
and there are several so we'll have to

2584
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:31,920
make the right

2585
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:34,559
question available for that the second

2586
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,560
one is

2587
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:42,000
is doing this over dccp

2588
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:44,320
the right thing to do for the working

2589
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,320
group

2590
02:04:44,480 --> 02:04:49,519
is the problem space an interesting one

2591
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:49,520
for the working group

2592
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:54,079
i think i would like to make discussion

2593
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:57,760
of these topics

2594
02:04:54,079 --> 02:05:00,400
on the list it's important to gauge

2595
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:02,400
level of interest in these drafts to

2596
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:04,000
figure out whether whether to adopt work

2597
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:06,719
in the space

2598
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:08,719
yeah i think so too david do you think

2599
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:12,560
there's time to hold a quick

2600
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:15,679
um feel around the room for

2601
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:18,960
who who has read

2602
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:20,719
these drafts we can try to do that

2603
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:23,119
quickly

2604
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:25,119
just take the red question as at least

2605
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:28,400
while dave is getting that prepared

2606
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:30,559
um we'll take the red question as being

2607
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:33,280
a sign of first interest but

2608
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:34,880
if you've become interested during this

2609
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,679
talk then of course you won't have read

2610
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:38,000
them

2611
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:38,719
and we just expect uh discussion on the

2612
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,159
list

2613
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:45,199
so if you've read them at the moment

2614
02:05:42,159 --> 02:05:49,839
can you indicate when david

2615
02:05:45,199 --> 02:05:49,839
tells us which is no

2616
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:03,280
and while we're talking about this a

2617
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,639
couple of things to remind people one is

2618
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:07,040
this is going to be talked about in

2619
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:07,840
iccrg from the congestion control

2620
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:10,960
perspective

2621
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:13,679
hopefully this week so please look there

2622
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:14,880
and the second is there are multiple

2623
02:06:13,679 --> 02:06:19,280
areas of ietf

2624
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:21,040
interest in atss in multipath

2625
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:22,639
and we are aware of these different

2626
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:24,880
things going on and we'd like to make

2627
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:26,239
sure we coordinate well across these

2628
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:28,560
so we're going to talk to our area

2629
02:06:26,239 --> 02:06:31,839
director uh to help

2630
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:31,840
do that coordination

2631
02:06:32,079 --> 02:06:35,360
okay i see that at least half a dozen

2632
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,800
people

2633
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:40,639
have read uh the draft so uh there is

2634
02:06:38,800 --> 02:06:42,840
some of the interest i think we need to

2635
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:44,719
go

2636
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:46,719
um

2637
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,000
i think we'll just plot with our id

2638
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,239
david yes we need

2639
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,159
needs of the ad and uh we'll figure out

2640
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:54,159
whether to run on adoption column list

2641
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:58,638
okay so um authors please keep in touch

2642
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,960
with the

2643
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:03,119
your chairs on this one and prompt us

2644
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,560
because we're going to make some

2645
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:05,759
discussions go forward and then we're

2646
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,119
going to report back to the working

2647
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:09,040
group what we find

2648
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:10,960
by way of a suggestion for progress and

2649
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:14,480
see if people like it

2650
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:14,480
okay thank you

2651
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:26,320
okay and with that i think we're done

2652
02:07:22,400 --> 02:07:30,000
um i'm going to keep stay on uh

2653
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:31,360
the uh editor session for a little while

2654
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,520
to see if i can capture

2655
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:35,598
um everything make sure everything

2656
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:36,560
that's crucial uh gets captured in the

2657
02:07:35,599 --> 02:07:38,480
minutes

2658
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:41,840
uh i think though we are done thank you

2659
02:07:38,480 --> 02:07:41,839
all very much

2660
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:47,280
yeah thank you we look forward to seeing

2661
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,280
you on wednesday

2662
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:55,840
even earlier ugh

2663
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:09,839
all right

2664
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:05,840
so

2665
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:33,840
do

2666
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:47,840
hmm

2667
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:01,920
you
