1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
hang on a second the robot

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,198
vacuumer just started i'll quit that so

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,199
we don't have to have that in the

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
background

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
while he's uh but we're waiting for him

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,079
to come back one thing i discovered i

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,520
had to do is my

8
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,000
i'm on the beta stream of my home

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
network provider and they usually do

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
updates so

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,160
like around two in the morning so i got

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,960
them to turn it off for this week

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
it's not usually an issue so all right

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
why don't we

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
get started um welcome six man this is

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,559
our second

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,560
session uh next slide

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
i think you've seen this i think you've

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
seen that

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,560
um and this was

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,158
the agenda from the first session

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,030
we didn't get to linda dunbar's talk so

23
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
that's going to be the first talk um

24
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,360
[Music]

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,119
now next slide

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,000
and then we have a report on the

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
sr compression design team there was

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
just

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,119
uh many of you may have been in the

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,360
spring working group that just

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,400
preceded this and there was a pretty big

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,680
long just

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,600
discussion about this we're gonna

34
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,640
we don't want to repeat that discussion

35
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,520
here so we'll keep it to the 15 minutes

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,560
and try to limit the discussion to

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,560
clarifying questions

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
and then we have two working group

39
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,520
drafts

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,960
the minimum path mtu hop by op option

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,158
and the alternate marking method draft

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
and

43
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,399
tom herbert was not able to attend so we

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,160
will not be

45
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:18,080
having a session on his draft

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,079
so any any questions

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,319
hopefully our speakers are here

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,080
i guess linda if you can just unmute

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,119
yourself i'll get the slides up for you

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,840
can you hear me we can hear you

51
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,840
oh great great

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,519
there we are good thank you so

53
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,959
um here i'm going to talk about um ipv6

54
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,959
based solution for the

55
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,800
5d um edge computing speaking service

56
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:58,239
next page please a little bit background

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,959
so in 5p um at computing it applies to

58
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,000
edge computing is a project in 3gpp

59
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,920
essay 2 under the project

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,720
23 748 so in the nutshell

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,159
um there is a 5d system on the left-hand

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,440
side of the dotted line

63
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,879
we have cell tower we have a packet

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,800
session anchor

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,920
and we have distributed functions for 5g

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,959
system

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,518
there is an interface to the local data

68
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,120
network

69
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,720
they call ldm for edge computing

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,319
there are many use cases being

71
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,599
identified in

72
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,958
3gpp for example they have

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,238
a command aerial vehicle

74
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,440
requiring like a drone to be managed by

75
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,400
the

76
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,519
controller they have virtual interactive

77
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,879
conferences

78
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,400
um well the common characteristics

79
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,679
of this 5gh computing is that there

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,840
could be many back-end servers

81
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,640
for the same application and they are

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,599
very close to you in proximity

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
next page please

84
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,000
um so because i'm here we're looking at

85
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,440
the from iplayer so what do we see from

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,320
iplayer for the local data network

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,680
for all those edge servers multiple edge

88
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,120
servers for one application

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
today the train is using anycast instead

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
of

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:35,280
having multiple local dns resolvers

92
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:39,520
in each ldm there are many many benefits

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,039
of using anycast not only it can balance

94
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,280
the traffic across different servers

95
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
using the utilizing the network

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
condition

97
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,919
is actually basically being able to

98
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,560
utilize the routing layer information to

99
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,599
achieve better load balancer load

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,320
balancing

101
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
and to remove the single pointer failure

102
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,120
at the dns resolver

103
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,638
all the application load balancers

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,199
also that the many client or user device

105
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,960
may use their cached ip addresses for

106
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,479
extended period of time

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,159
so if we use the dns server at each

108
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:24,320
ldm some of the client may not even

109
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,280
bother to do inquiry

110
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,520
of course using any cast among multiple

111
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,280
servers in close proximity

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,359
also bring up issues um like

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,679
because they are so close to each other

114
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,800
for 5g network

115
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,880
one application server in ldn1

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,080
maybe is very close to the one in ldm2

117
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,520
so the network distance difference is

118
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,080
not significant enough to balance out

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,359
other factors like for example higher

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,000
capacity

121
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
or maybe some side maybe more preferred

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
than others

123
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,318
so there are other issues brought up by

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,960
this

125
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:10,160
um next slide please

126
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,359
so the sticky service in the

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
5k edge computing is referring to the

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
scenario

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,799
uh where the edge servers

130
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,680
are very close to each other

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,319
when the user device ue initially

132
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
anchored

133
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,319
to the psa one package session anchor

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
one

135
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,720
and moving to a second cell tower

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,160
and to be anchored at a psa2

137
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,759
for this particular ue the service is

138
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,199
better to be served

139
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,240
by the original server so they call it

140
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,360
sticky

141
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,080
so in a way that if you look at the

142
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
local data network too there will be

143
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240
many many

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,638
traffic from different uee different

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,759
users or different applications

146
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,199
and even from the same user it may have

147
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,599
multiple applications all those users

148
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
they

149
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:10,800
actually may resolve to for example ip3

150
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,400
may may be anchored into the edge

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,639
application server too versus the newly

152
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:23,359
migrant ue1 need to go to ldl1

153
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,240
so in the um 3gpp sa2 edge computing

154
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,440
project

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,639
there are many uh proposed solutions and

156
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
we find that

157
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,160
actually ipv6 provide a very elegant

158
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
solution

159
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,560
that's why we want to present here to

160
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,520
get people's feedback

161
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,520
next slide please

162
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:47,360
next slide so ipv6 has this elegant

163
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,479
um very convenient way having this

164
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,759
destination extension header um

165
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,479
so this is the flow um

166
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,560
when the ue traffic coming to anchored

167
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,360
to the psa psa1

168
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,039
that goes through the e-node b and the

169
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,319
the gtp tunnel is terminated by the psa1

170
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,960
so after the traffic coming out of psa1

171
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,840
to the

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,878
ingress router to the local data network

173
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,878
will have source

174
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,440
and destination based on the

175
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
criteria in choosing the closest any

176
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
cash server

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
and it will end up to go to the anycast

178
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,160
server say

179
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,319
s1 attached to the router

180
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,760
r1 we call r1 being the egress router

181
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,360
and we assume that for the anycast

182
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,399
for the sticky service is not for all

183
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
services

184
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,800
so there will be application manager

185
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,359
uh informing the the routers

186
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,399
of the services that they need to be

187
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
speaking

188
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
so when the s1 server coming back with

189
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
the response

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,120
back to the source the

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,839
r1 basically insert

192
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,200
use the acl to filter out the service

193
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,560
and insert the

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,519
sticky service sticky destinations of

195
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,719
tov

196
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,839
inside the destination extension header

197
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,920
so then the traffic comes back to

198
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:23,760
back to the ue and in the ue

199
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,880
it has the expected behavior to copy

200
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
the destination extension header from

201
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,600
the received packet

202
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,519
to the subsequent packets for the

203
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
services and for the flows that need to

204
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,240
be sticky

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
so with that when the ue moved to anchor

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
to the psa2

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,320
on the traffic comes to the router b

208
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,800
and the router b will be able to

209
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
be informed by the sticky service

210
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,640
management system

211
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
to filter all those packets and be able

212
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,760
to filter out

213
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,600
the original egress router which is r1

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,959
and with that information our router b

215
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
can either use a tunnel or use a segment

216
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,119
rounding

217
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,880
to forward the packet to explicitly

218
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,680
to the router one to achieve this

219
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,600
service to be

220
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,640
sticky to the original server

221
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
next page please

222
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:30,239
so here's the um sticky service subtle

223
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,479
there's a sticky type um

224
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
right now which is defined as just to

225
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,200
represent

226
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,000
um we have two types one is the um

227
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
the egress router can be identified with

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
32 bits

229
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,839
identifier even if the router

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,640
equals router is using ipv6 address

231
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,399
we assume that within some environment

232
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,000
the local data network

233
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,360
is managed by one provider they can use

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
a shorter

235
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
identifier to represent the egress

236
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,560
router

237
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,079
there could be if that's not the case

238
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,680
say in the heterogeneous environment

239
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,880
you have to use the actual address

240
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
then the sticky type can set to two then

241
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
with that

242
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,000
you will use the tunnel endpoint subtle

243
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,880
which is defined by the tunneling cap

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,839
draft

245
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,439
to represent the egress router and we

246
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,160
put this sticky surface

247
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,279
sticky destination subtle in the

248
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
destination

249
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,240
extension header

250
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
next page please

251
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,680
another option say this is hope to get

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,600
some feedback from the

253
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,239
experts here there's uh also the ipv6

254
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
routing extension header so based on the

255
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
definition of the routing extension

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
header

257
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
um is to say is to list the

258
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
number of intermediate nodes to be

259
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,880
visited on the way to the

260
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
destination packet destination so in

261
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
this case

262
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
that would be the egress router to be

263
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
one

264
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,519
the nodes to be visited so we'd like to

265
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,399
get some feedback um is

266
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,399
is it okay like um routing extension

267
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,959
header versus destination extension

268
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
header

269
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,839
do people have any opinions on that

270
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,959
send information from destination

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
the destination option is the right

272
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,800
thing for that routing header would only

273
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
be appropriate if you really wanted to

274
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
steer the packet along some specific

275
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,800
path and

276
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
i don't think that's your primary goal

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,839
that's right

278
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,920
okay thank you very much ron so you

279
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,040
limited this option we'll just take the

280
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:06,639
destination header um next page

281
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:09,360
we also have eric in the queue oh okay

282
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,680
i was going to uh agree with ron uh i

283
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,040
think

284
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,719
if you give it uh if you put in the

285
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,319
destination header then you open the

286
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,160
possibility that it could be still be

287
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
delivered to the end point

288
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,040
uh at um was it l2 or whatever but that

289
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,800
l2 could open a proxy session

290
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
for certain applications and maybe proxy

291
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
it back to l1

292
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,199
if you if you leave it in the

293
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,199
destination header

294
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,839
thank you okay next page

295
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,479
so this is for um um when the user

296
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,680
device

297
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,199
like older older version doesn't

298
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,120
do what 3gpp spec is doing

299
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,439
so it doesn't do anything with the

300
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,800
incoming package doesn't copy

301
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199
the destination option header into the

302
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,800
next

303
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,319
subsequent package this is one option to

304
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,479
achieve the sticky

305
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,480
service this required 5g

306
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,120
management system cooperation like

307
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,800
through the network exposure function

308
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,839
so when the session manager

309
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,040
is determining that this ue1 need to be

310
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,800
re-anchored to a new psa

311
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,599
usually they have the handshaking period

312
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,959
to maintain the service continuity so

313
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,320
with that

314
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,719
5g management system can notify the

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,360
local data network management system

316
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,639
that

317
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,079
this particular user is to be

318
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,079
re-anchored and then with that

319
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,359
this router ingress router will be able

320
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,239
to

321
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,399
find out through his routing protocol

322
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,360
find out where this psa2 is

323
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,760
attached and be able to send this sticky

324
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,440
service sub theory

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,720
information to the new ingress router

326
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,920
so that's the service without dependence

327
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,199
on the ui behavior

328
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,319
next case next page um

329
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,599
here is the another case where there's

330
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,360
no assistance from

331
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,519
5g system at all so if

332
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
local network data network doesn't get

333
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,160
any assistance from

334
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,439
5g core then the ingress router

335
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,240
every time he receive the packet

336
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
with the destination extension header

337
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,759
embedded

338
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,560
you need to inform his neighboring

339
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,240
routers

340
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,119
uh assume that the uh 5g site a

341
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,759
there's our a there has like 10

342
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,800
neighbors

343
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,759
immediate neighbors and then he need to

344
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,959
be able to send his this destination

345
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,519
header information

346
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,880
to all the neighboring ingress router so

347
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,519
all those ingress router

348
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,439
will have the acl to filter out the

349
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,040
sticky service ids

350
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,759
and if he ever receive a packet

351
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,759
which matches with the sticky service id

352
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,639
and the float label

353
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,480
from his neighboring router it will

354
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,600
start to

355
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,000
extract the the destination

356
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
egress original egress router from the

357
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,839
destiny

358
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,120
destination header and then form um

359
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,680
either tunneling or sr

360
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,880
approach to forward the packet to the

361
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,959
original

362
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,240
original egress router um

363
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,279
next page okay

364
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,399
so um as i said earlier the purpose is

365
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,639
to get feedback from the experts here um

366
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
to validate this approach actually

367
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,160
workable

368
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,959
and we are looking for feedback if it's

369
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
workable

370
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,959
we can propose this to 3gbp to show

371
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
for ipv6 actually the solution is very

372
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,719
elegant instead

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,800
of many other proposed solutions out

374
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,839
there

375
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,319
in addition to i should say okay so

376
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,480
we're

377
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,240
a little over time but if you have um if

378
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,760
there's some quick comments

379
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,760
if not we can take it to the list

380
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,000
all right well thank you linda and um

381
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,079
yeah but

382
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
please please encourage people to

383
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,319
comment on the list

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,319
okay

385
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,840
okay let me get the slides up here

386
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,840
there we are

387
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,840
let's see so

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,840
we chang please uh the floor is yours

389
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
we can hear you

390
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,719
do i need to open the video

391
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
it's up to you we're happy to see your

392
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
lovely face

393
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,600
okay i see the zoo in

394
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,640
in six mind group

395
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,879
you're required to open the video right

396
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,880
okay

397
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:25,520
so i think

398
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,520
the spring chairs

399
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,240
spring working group chairs suggest that

400
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:35,440
we should represent the present

401
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,559
isr comprising design team report

402
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,480
for six months to keep

403
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:45,840
everyone on the same page about the work

404
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,120
and the six month charts kindly

405
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,399
approve the our leader application

406
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,000
so thank you very much here i'm

407
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,440
very glad to report the status and

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,240
the plan on behalf of the

409
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,240
team members next page

410
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,120
so the overview of the design team

411
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,879
is shown in this page

412
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,239
the design team was set up

413
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:22,840
at this july and

414
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,520
we have eight team members

415
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,360
from uh huawei

416
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,960
channel mobile telecom cisco

417
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,320
uh juniper uh asu

418
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,360
nokia and zte

419
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,399
we have a middle east uh now

420
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,600
it's a private but

421
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,320
the archive can be

422
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:53,600
read by anyone about the documents

423
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:57,200
if we deliver the internet drafts

424
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,799
we will put them in the data track

425
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,080
of itf and we also

426
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,918
have a github space to

427
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,199
store the meeting minutes and documents

428
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,400
the link here is open

429
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,679
for anyone in the

430
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,400
for the meetings typically

431
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:27,200
we have a weekly meeting in order to

432
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:32,080
submit the requirements draft by atf 109

433
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,760
in last two months we run

434
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,960
twice meeting per week uh i think

435
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,158
the team members in the design team

436
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,919
offer uh great

437
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:50,320
efforts on the document and

438
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:53,919
we have already

439
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:58,639
submitted the requirement dropped

440
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,640
on time as we promised

441
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:05,280
here i i think we should

442
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,919
thank all the team members

443
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,918
next page

444
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,479
for the scope of the design team

445
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:19,919
it was defined very clear by spring

446
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,760
working group chairs the design team

447
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:28,159
is produce rough concerns

448
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:32,080
outputs to the working group

449
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,200
on two topics one is the requirements

450
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,559
for the compression

451
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,320
solution the second is

452
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:46,080
the compress com

453
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:50,080
comp reason or the analysis

454
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:53,120
document to the working group

455
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,399
and here i would like to point

456
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:00,000
that all the draft

457
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,520
even if it

458
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,400
is agreed within the design team

459
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
it is still

460
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,520
is a individual

461
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,280
draft for the working group

462
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,400
so that is the basic scope of the

463
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,399
dante next page

464
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,760
and the working group also hope

465
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,720
we can answer uh the following two

466
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,600
questions

467
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,520
one is why there are several uh

468
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,600
proposals

469
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:41,679
already standardized why the is there

470
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,240
uh value in picking one or some

471
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,039
i i don't think we have touched those

472
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,760
questions

473
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:54,400
now we only focus on requirements

474
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,760
but the working group of spring

475
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,120
also very nice they

476
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,240
consider if a design team can

477
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,439
not get agree agreement

478
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,559
on those questions

479
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,080
that is uh also acceptable

480
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:19,360
to the chairs so that is

481
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,360
some additional information next page

482
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,640
so for the design team uh i think

483
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,240
we have a rough plan uh

484
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,520
first stage during itf

485
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,000
108 to itf 109

486
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,039
we hope to output a requirement draft

487
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
i think we have

488
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,678
achieved this

489
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,639
plan and the second is during

490
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,679
itf 109 to itf

491
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,360
uh 110

492
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,880
we will do some analysis on several

493
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:07,120
proposals and the output

494
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:12,240
initial analysis draft

495
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,239
so this is a basic plan next page

496
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,360
next page there we are sorry

497
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:27,039
yeah the uh precise

498
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:32,399
uh of the design team uh

499
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:34,640
so far so good uh i think

500
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,640
we

501
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:43,279
we have achieved

502
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:47,120
what we promised till now we kicked

503
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:51,039
off since end of july

504
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:54,799
and uh till now we have

505
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,840
had more than 20 meetings

506
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,120
during those meetings we

507
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,158
drafted the two versions

508
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,279
of a requirement and you can

509
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:10,400
access the current version

510
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,679
of the draft through the link in this

511
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,559
page

512
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:19,600
and we are calling for the

513
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:23,600
uh review and we also hope a

514
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,039
six-month working group can give

515
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,520

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,320
possible

518
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,799
and clarifying clarifying question just

519
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,279
so the the last milestone that's a year

520
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,279
from now

521
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:48,559
because it says 2021

522
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,559
oh yes yeah um

523
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,799
oh sorry that that should be 20 20.

524
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,799

so sorry for that yeah yeah it came up

526
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,840
in the chat room so

527
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,520
okay next page

528
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,279
okay here's is uh overview of the

529
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,960
requirements draft

530
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,120
there are three main parts of the

531
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,640
requirements

532
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,000
the first aspect aspect

533
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,120
is srb6 the seedless

534
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,120
compression requirement the second

535
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,399
activist is srb6

536
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,239
specific requirement

537
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,000
and the last one is protocol design

538
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,760
requirements as well as

539
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,039
we have a appendix

540
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,158
in this draft which

541
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:56,200
contains some requirements

542
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,200
without unanimity the

543
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:03,279
unanimous concerns

544
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:07,120
within the design team in the figure

545
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:10,480
the item with the right flag

546
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,600
is those which have been agreed

547
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,640
within the design team the ones

548
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,959
with the green flag is also

549
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,640
without unanimous

550
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,919
concerns within the design team

551
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
uh so next page

552
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,840
uh let's see some

553
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,840
next step plan next page

554
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,080
okay so for the requirements draft we

555
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,679
hope to finish

556
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,720
it soon we hope to gather

557
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:52,480
the comments from a

558
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,799
working group in next

559
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,919
one or two weeks and

560
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,879
within the design team we will have some

561
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,960
discussion

562
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,399
and resolved resolve them

563
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,600
soon for the deland team we hope to

564
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:16,719
generate a new revision by

565
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,840
end of this year and we hope to

566
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:24,240
submit the version

567
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
on time so next page

568
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,520
for the analysis draft phase

569
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,720
uh i think the design team will provide

570
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,039
a list of

571
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:41,200
proposals at first i think

572
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,200
the list will be

573
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:50,000
posted to itf

574
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:54,158
in january 2021

575
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,480
and we hope to uh submit uh

576
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:02,240
initial analysis draft to uh

577
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,520
itf before uh

578
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,559
next meeting so that's all

579
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,480
that is basic status and applying

580
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,879
for the design team

581
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,520
okay thank you we have a little time for

582
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,760
some

583
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,799
comments though let's not there was a

584
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,799
big discussion

585
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,000
in the spring working group so let's not

586
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,840
repeat that but

587
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
so ron

588
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,600
first thanks to wai ching during hiring

589
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,919
a lot of work

590
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
second people might get excited that the

591
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,080
document looks incomplete

592
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,600
there are requirements that are still in

593
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,720
the open state that aren't in the

594
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,120
document

595
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,320
um so if it looks incomplete

596
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,439
don't get too nervous about it yet um

597
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,158
second is a question probably for eric

598
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
klein

599
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:00,960
and you bob and olay we've had an

600
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,080
open call for adoption on the crh draft

601
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,039
since late may um

602
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,559
it's waiting on this design team it

603
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,919
looks like the design team

604
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:15,039
won't be back until

605
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,919
um ietf 110.

606
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,600
now i have customers who are interested

607
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,880
in the crh

608
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,559
but could care less about the srv6

609
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,960
control plane

610
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,960
they're provisioning their boxes from a

611
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,279
controller that does everything so

612
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,039
they don't want the srv6 control plane

613
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,480
or anyone else

614
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,158
um sooner or later you know

615
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,960
when do we make the decision to adopt

616
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,240
crh for no reason other than for the

617
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,840
people who are

618
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,840
using it and not using any iepf routing

619
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
protocol

620
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,760
i don't have a really good answer for

621
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,720
you ron

622
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,279
i sort of was thinking the same thing

623
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,120
when i was listening to it in the spring

624
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,360
presentations maybe it's a question for

625
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,360
eric

626
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,360
eric do you have any comments yeah yeah

627
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,600
well i was gonna try to

628
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,479
add myself to the cube maybe i'll just

629
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,760
just use the

630
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,399
button um

631
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,080
i think uh i think it's important to

632
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,840
note that the

633
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,519
the sr design team well it may be going

634
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,559
slow it does seem to be

635
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,080
it does seem to be working it's uh just

636
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,559
maybe not working fast

637
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,600
but uh we had talked about there being

638
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,879
some other options

639
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,360
like um whether or not six man needs to

640
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,159
adopt

641
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,678
fcrh or whatnot you need you just need a

642
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,880
um

643
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,679
a rooting header some type

644
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,000
yes i'd be happy you know that would be

645
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,440
a

646
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,919
good place to start so

647
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,120
um uh

648
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,440
i think i think we could look at we

649
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,439
could consider uh

650
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,960
i could i could double check with

651
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
rooting 80s and see if

652
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,720
how they feel about that i don't

653
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,320
personally have any problem with that at

654
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,919
all so

655
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,120
okay sounds good um yeah i am also

656
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,640
hoping that

657
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,840
um by watching what the design team is

658
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
doing we can sort of

659
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,120
try to figure out where they're heading

660
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,120
and that may help too

661
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,600
does the design team look like it's

662
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,000
going to need a new rooting header or

663
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,760
some type

664
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,760
i'm sorry yes it's spring in general

665
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,399
so uh excuse me couldn't i

666
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,399
uh give some words on that

667
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,600
please uh yeah from a design team

668
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,799
side i think the scoop for

669
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,719
us is very clear one

670
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:10,320
is to output a requirement

671
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,840
draft and the second day is do some

672
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,039
analysis on the proposals

673
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,480
which have been submitted

674
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:24,240
to itf

675
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,120
page so from my point of view

676
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,120
we should uh keep uh

677
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,399
study on those um uh different uh

678
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,439
proposals uh and uh

679
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,479
if cih is

680
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,559
adopted by six mind

681
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,320
i don't think the there is a direct

682
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,918
uh relationship between the

683
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:57,360
draft output to uh

684
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,399
italy and as i just

685
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,479
mentioned any draft

686
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,600
uh output from uh

687
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,800
design team they are all the

688
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,078
individual draft and that is

689
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,359
not any

690
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,560
agreement for the working group or for

691
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,639
iekf

692
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:26,159
so i think uh design team just

693
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:29,760
uh to give some uh

694
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:33,040
i think maybe some guide or information

695
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,240
uh on the direction i don't think that

696
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,918
should be

697
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:42,078
used as some justification

698
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:44,879
uh or something like that

699
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,480
thank you okay so let's try to get

700
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,598
through the rest of the queue

701
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,760
so ask the darren i think you're next

702
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,760
but let's try to keep the comments short

703
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,320
just on the context of what

704
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,000
whether the design team thinks that

705
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,880
there's a new voting header subtype

706
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,720
needed uh

707
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,000
the design team is just focused on

708
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,399
building the requirements and then

709
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,400
allowing

710
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,320
not analyzing the proposals eric so i

711
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,160
don't think you're gonna get anything on

712
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,880
on you know there won't be a design of a

713
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,040
solution

714
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,200
by the design team it's just the

715
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,400
requirements and analysis

716
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,720
of the proposals that it's going to

717
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,720
produce

718
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,839
okay chen

719
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,399
yeah uh the the progress of

720
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,160
uh the design team is going where and

721
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,599
we are going to finish the discussion

722
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,960
as soon as possible but

723
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,240
it's not the like contest used right now

724
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,040
and it oh it's also not the uh

725
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,560
requirement of the human being working

726
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,279
group so i don't think

727
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,279
the down any solution

728
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,440
okay andrew

729
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:17,119
so what i kind of want to say is

730
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,118
looking at the whole crh thing right now

731
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,240
we're in a situation where this has been

732
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,160
around for

733
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,879
a number of ieps and we've moved from

734
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,839
requirements documents to a design team

735
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,880
to etc etc the fact is

736
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,400
is that this code is shipping today it's

737
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,040
in production code

738
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,240
and there are people like myself who

739
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,520
need it

740
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,720
and we need it in order to

741
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,280
deal with geopolitical issues for one

742
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,720
thing

743
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
it's critical for dealing with

744
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,359
geopolitical issues

745
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,880
and avoiding the suppression of internet

746
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,640
freedoms that's what we're using it for

747
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,280
i'll bobby blunt

748
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,598
and by delaying this any further

749
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,680
all that we are doing is driving

750
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,839
protocol development

751
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,598
further outside of the ietf because the

752
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,680
development is not going to stop this is

753
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,560
simply too critical

754
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,200
and i would argue that that is not in

755
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,839
the interests of the technical community

756
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,439
it is not in the interests of the ietf

757
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,839
it is not in the interests of the

758
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,680
vendors

759
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,680
who their very customers are the

760
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,078
operators and we have a

761
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,118
massive demand for this

762
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,000
on the continent where we have to have a

763
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,560
working solution which is what crh gives

764
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
us

765
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,640
to deal with authoritarian states

766
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,320
who wish to play with traffic this is

767
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,480
how we deal with it

768
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,359
and i am pleading with this working

769
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,400
group to

770
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,040
let let's stop the delays

771
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,160
because crh as we've said is a building

772
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,079
block it is not

773
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,839
tied to srh it is not tied to srv6

774
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,560
it's treated as such and get this thing

775
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,160
adopted

776
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,000
so that we've got a protocol that is

777
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,680
developed within the ietf

778
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,880
rather than entirely outside of the

779
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,879
auspices of this body

780
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:19,839
all right thank you andrew understood

781
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,839
okay whim

782
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
go ahead

783
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,520
you are very faint uh women yeah

784
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
we can't hear you

785
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,119
do you want to see if you can fix your

786
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,280
audio issues and then we go to so far

787
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,680
and then come back to um is that okay

788
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,119
and when you're at the head of the queue

789
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,960
please unmute yourself a couple of

790
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,359
seconds ahead of time because it's

791
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
it takes a little while to get going

792
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,400
okay safar

793
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,759
disappeared uh when do you want to try

794
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,839
again or

795
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,839
otherwise we'll go to zenbin

796
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,079
okay okay uh this is

797
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,640
from huawei uh so i first i

798
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,119
very appreciate the the design team's

799
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,920
work

800
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,040
because i know they will try very hard

801
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,400
to

802
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,359
propel this department's job the second

803
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,240
point i mean

804
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,359
that you have the adoption of this the

805
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,479
crh and

806
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,520
the relationship of the adoption and the

807
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,320
retirement

808
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,880
has been discussed between the routine

809
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,079
area

810
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,560
and the intel area i think that if the

811
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,079
work

812
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:45,759
is being done for the adoption i think

813
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,440
this not only the entire area but it

814
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,079
also should be coordinated

815
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,280
with looking area and the spring working

816
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,440
group

817
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
uh the third one i want to know that i

818
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,000
wanted to clarify i think

819
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,320
in the adoption the first adoption

820
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,800
process of the crh

821
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,000
even without the requirement of the

822
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,920
design team there's a studio of the

823
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,200
comments under the challenge of the

824
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,920
existing the

825
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,960
city work because for example i want to

826
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,000
know the

827
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,040
was the id to be identified and also

828
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,240
besides this

829
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,480
idea identified also the existing the

830
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,640
functionalities such as the vpn

831
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,760
l2 vpn uh how to be supported

832
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,040
with the crazy we need to understand the

833
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,920
whole framework

834
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,960
i mean for the solution is not only the

835
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,680
data plane

836
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,040
but also is how we need to understand

837
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,200
the whole picture

838
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,200
yeah so that's my uh the point

839
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,640
okay thank you so whim uh last

840
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,920
let's see if your audio works i try more

841
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,040
one more time or not

842
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:02,240
yeah yeah we can hear you

843
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:05,359
okay forget it no oh he couldn't hear us

844
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,479
we could hear him okay all right well

845
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,920
um thank you interesting discussion we

846
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,880
will have some follow-up

847
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,119
with um our ads after the meeting is

848
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,119
over

849
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,200
so next presentation i think that is

850
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,640
bob and gory on the uh

851
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,078
i think it's going to be gory excellent

852
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,520
corey the floor is yours well first of

853
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,040
all can you hear me

854
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,640
we can hear excellent okay

855
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,839
so um this

856
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,118
talk is one that's on a draft that's

857
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,759
jointly with bob

858
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,480
um i'm going to do the talking um we're

859
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
being helped by

860
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,359
anna who's doing some data experiments

861
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,599
which we'll talk about a little later

862
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,119
the the draft is um the ikey v6 minimum

863
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,440
path mtu hot by hub

864
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,040
option and we're at revision4 which

865
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,960
we'll talk about in a few slides

866
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,839
please go ahead the background is

867
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,280
um we assert that path mtu discovery

868
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,560
isn't working well

869
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,480
and we'll explain that in some

870
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,680
measurements in a few minutes

871
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,319
um the hot optic option

872
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,720
is being proposed as an idea to exchange

873
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,079
the

874
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,839
path mtu that routers have as a probe

875
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,400
package is sent across the network

876
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,078
they add the path mtu and we think this

877
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,119
has got a better trust relationship than

878
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,880
the current use of ptb messages

879
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,640
and before you all come to the mic to

880
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,440
complain yeah we know it doesn't work in

881
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,040
all places

882
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,480
and we'll we'll prove that in a few

883
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,040
minutes next slide

884
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,520
this is the shape of the hot by hop

885
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,560
option

886
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,400
if you haven't seen this before the bb

887
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,000
and c lines just underneath the package

888
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,359
are the most important

889
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,680
in other words if you are a ipv6 router

890
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,160
and you get this hot buy hop option

891
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,480
you can skip it and continue processing

892
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,078
um we prefer you to fill this in

893
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,760
because it will tell us things but we're

894
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,839
aware that some routers won't do this

895
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,480
and that's quite okay

896
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,920
and we'd prefer you to update it so the

897
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,800
the information here is about the

898
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,040
minimum path mtu that you see

899
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,160
and the second field returns by what the

900
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,319
other end point

901
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
finally saw the destination back to the

902
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,279
source

903
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,640
so this is a fairly small piece of

904
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,920
information just

905
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,400
just two bites and it helps us a lot

906
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,400
next slide

907
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,560
what have we done when we revised um

908
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
zero three and zero four we did two

909
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,560
revisions in the last period

910
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,319
and our two revisions did a fairly big

911
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,319
rewrite of the words

912
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,000
um our original words were good of

913
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,640
course because we try to write good

914
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,079
words

915
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,319
but they're now actually good and

916
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,000
readable by others which is a real

917
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,000
advantage

918
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,200
we think so if you prove us wrong please

919
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,880
read it because

920
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,799
my final slide is going to say read this

921
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,200
draft because it's now structured in a

922
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
way

923
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,118
which is which presents the different

924
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,000
parts to different people who are

925
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,920
interested

926
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,160
we talk about what the router has to do

927
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,760
we talk about what the source has to do

928
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,839
we talk about what the destination has

929
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,640
to do and we talk a little bit about how

930
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,640
to use the information

931
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,839
one of the things we did when we rewrote

932
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,000
it was we

933
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,640
we and aberdeen looked a little bit into

934
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
how the api worked in freebsd

935
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,000
for using this information

936
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
and you know that that was a helpful

937
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,400
thing to do because it

938
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,079
helped us understand a little bit more

939
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,000
how the option could actually be used

940
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:40,240
higher up the stack

941
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,280
and dplp mtud which we've loved trying

942
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,520
to say for

943
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,119
several years now is now an rfc rfc 8899

944
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,200
which is arguably much easier to

945
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,280
remember than the long acronym

946
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,560
so we've referenced that and maybe in

947
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,079
future we'll just call it

948
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:58,078
rfc 88.99 next slide

949
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,240
um one of the things that was

950
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,839
exposed by looking at the api was

951
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,078
there's probably two ways to use the

952
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,640
information that's in the option

953
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,400
the first way is basically in the way

954
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,520
path mtu discovery has traditionally

955
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,920
used it

956
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,800
you get a packet back with some

957
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,280
information

958
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,800
you use it at the ipv6 layer or you

959
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,200
directly change the

960
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,000
the cache or entries you have for path

961
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,598
mtu

962
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,079
for the flows that you've received these

963
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,000
messages for

964
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,359
the other way you can use it is as a

965
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,480
probe in

966
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,119
plp mtud in which case the

967
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,680
contents of the option is passed up to

968
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,800
the

969
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,240
upper layer the upper layer

970
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,920
then reads the options data it can

971
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,598
validate the options data because it

972
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,119
knows more about

973
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,960
the contents of the packet which it

974
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,240
receives as a probe

975
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,160
and then highlighted in green there is a

976
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,399
way for this

977
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,680
upper layer protocol to then throw away

978
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,960
the option data

979
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,720
if the packet isn't validated

980
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,000
it seems subtle you probably have to

981
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,240
read the draft to

982
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,079
to understand it properly but what this

983
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,560
means is if the upper layer processes

984
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
the

985
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,119
hop option data then

986
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,079
um you can have a better security method

987
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,599
uh because the hop option data can't be

988
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,640
easily injected off path

989
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:26,640
if this happens um that that

990
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,680
simple check of can you deliver it to

991
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,759
the upper layer

992
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,279
is the upper layer expecting this packet

993
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,480
with the option attached to it

994
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,240
provides a lot of extra security

995
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,599
and by thinking this through

996
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,520
particularly the two different ways you

997
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,920
could use the hot buy hop option

998
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,599
we came up with a much greater security

999
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,680
considerations section

1000
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,920
which i think i'd like to suggest

1001
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,399
suggest the document is also

1002
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,000
probably ready for greater review maybe

1003
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,000
even publications soon

1004
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,400
because we have a security consideration

1005
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,760
section that talks about the

1006
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,599
network layer processing we talk about

1007
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,520
the validation of the options data and

1008
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,520
we talk about the impact of middle boxes

1009
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,800
a nice discussion of how the method

1010
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:12,799
works i guess next slide

1011
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,879
um i tried to go quickly because we've

1012
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:23,040
got slides also on experiments

1013
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,480
um the hop option experiments have

1014
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,520
currently been based around

1015
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:31,680
some ipv6 probes which look like this

1016
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,680
it's a small form pc

1017
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:36,839
that's running the probe software we

1018
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,240
have six of these probes in various

1019
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,759
places

1020
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:45,919
two in the usa um two in the uk

1021
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,000
um one at home and one elsewhere

1022
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,119
we're looking for more people who want

1023
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,319
to have probes and join in the probing

1024
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,280
and discovery of where this works so

1025
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,839
we'd really

1026
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,800
love you to contact us particularly if

1027
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,119
you have

1028
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,240
ipv6 interest and you're interested in a

1029
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,839
larger amp to you

1030
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,558
or you might even be able to host one of

1031
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:08,558
these so please talk to us

1032
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,480
because we've we found we found out that

1033
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,760
the probe that i have at my house

1034
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:18,000
is is um

1035
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:20,480
is fairly limited in mtu

1036
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,599
limited mtu and also in other ways if we

1037
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,599
go carry on bob

1038
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,079
next slide

1039
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,160
right so first set of results mtu

1040
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:38,079
okay so what did we find out we did

1041
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,000
a lot of experiments for mtu to figure

1042
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,119
out what mtu we saw

1043
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:47,440
running from these probes

1044
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,520
to sites select the alexa top 1 million

1045
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,040
we looked at half a million targets for

1046
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,079
ipv4

1047
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,040
only 300 000 targets for ipv6

1048
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,599
but the picture emerges quite clearly so

1049
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,079
the first

1050
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,680
bit of good news is that these from

1051
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:05,359
these target

1052
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,680
locations uh which are arguably not

1053
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,119
isp edge locations we know that but for

1054
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,759
these locations

1055
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,760
most of the past got pathed to use

1056
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,520
greater than 1500 bytes

1057
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:21,119
and that applies for ipv6 also

1058
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,559
96 that's great so what happens to the

1059
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,040
remaining four percent

1060
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,800
that it's slightly sadder answer for the

1061
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,680
remaining four percent

1062
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:33,920
uh path mtu discovery works well with

1063
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:37,440
ipv6 for 0.05 percent of cases

1064
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,079
so in these 0.05 percent of cases

1065
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,880
we received a ptb message from a router

1066
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,079
on the path

1067
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,040
telling us the new mtu it's supported

1068
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,640
and the old style pathetic discovery

1069
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,400
worked and gave us the right answer

1070
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:56,640
the path validated and that was great

1071
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:59,920
for about 0.07 we got a ptb message back

1072
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,440
from a router on path with a ptb message

1073
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,280
but then we still couldn't make the path

1074
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,160
work okay um

1075
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,440
these are just broken paths um sometimes

1076
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,440
the internet isn't working

1077
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,400
or maybe the target server isn't

1078
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:15,680
actually online that we're trying

1079
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,839
so 3.3 percent of paths

1080
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,960
didn't give us a ptb message that

1081
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,839
actually told us

1082
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,400
a workable path mtu maybe they gave us a

1083
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,759
ptb

1084
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,599
message but but it didn't

1085
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,119
actually work because it was another

1086
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:31,440
bottleneck further down

1087
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:33,200
or more likely we got no ptb message at

1088
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,359
all

1089
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,919
the good news is that if you probe these

1090
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:42,799
paths with a packet probe using

1091
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:45,599
dplp mtud rfc 8899

1092
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,640
then you could get a path through so

1093
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,520
path mtu

1094
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,520
discovery using plp mtud would help

1095
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:57,119
but plp mtud relies on sending

1096
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,759
successive probes

1097
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,520
so you can't discover this in one shot

1098
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,559
you have to use multiple probes to get

1099
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,440
there

1100
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,000
and the idea between the behind the hot

1101
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,280
by hop

1102
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,920
option is that you can send discovery

1103
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,720
packet

1104
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:16,319
and avoid all that number of probes

1105
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:22,000
particularly if you want to get a big

1106
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:24,079
mtu that saves you many many rtts

1107
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,520
so good news and bad news bad news if

1108
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,280
you talk about pmtud for ipv6

1109
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,240
lots of people implemented it but few

1110
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,599
routers actually give you the

1111
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,640
information you need

1112
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,599
plp by the way there is a poll going on

1113
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,440
in the background

1114
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,520
about people how many people have read

1115
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:42,079
the draft please

1116
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,079
fill it in

1117
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,640
welcome interruption from bob yeah do i

1118
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:53,599
ticket

1119
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,160
next slide you're welcome bob

1120
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,000
you can do the slides if you like no

1121
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,799
you're good

1122
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,119
uh next slide then if we oh we're good

1123
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:06,800
we got it larger internet mtu

1124
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:09,040
so um my ambition in life

1125
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,000
partly is that we get to use these

1126
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,160
really

1127
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,040
big frames that ethernet actually

1128
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,480
provides

1129
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,720
even though the ieee haven't

1130
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,760
standardized them because we know many

1131
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,279
line cards

1132
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,960
actually support large uh mtus

1133
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,880
and we know many servers have them and

1134
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,000
many client operating systems support

1135
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,119
these

1136
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,079
so what's our chance of using them

1137
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,400
so i had data that showed tests from the

1138
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:37,040
edge

1139
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,920
looking at uh the alexa top 1 million

1140
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,000
and

1141
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,440
it wasn't very exciting muslim supported

1142
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
1500

1143
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,800
very boring so why might that be the

1144
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,520
case

1145
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,680
on end-to-end paths across the internet

1146
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,920
to web service

1147
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,960
well one place to look is perhaps in the

1148
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,040
peering database

1149
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,640
what do internet exchanges actually

1150
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,920
advertise as an mtu

1151
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,799
i mean you've got to get your packets

1152
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,800
via an internet exchange in most cases

1153
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:08,480
and the answer is 38 in peering db

1154
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:11,599
use a default mtu 51

1155
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,760
use a 1500 byte mtu probably the same

1156
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,160
advertisement actually

1157
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,079
so only seven percent used a nine

1158
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,839
kilobyte

1159
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,760
mtu well okay you mean you could take

1160
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,799
that good or bad there is a

1161
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,359
seven percent of ixes

1162
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:32,079
insert exchanges actually support a big

1163
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:35,598
mtu so that's pretty good

1164
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:37,920
um it might not help you in general

1165
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,440
we don't have isp data and i suspect if

1166
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,280
we had isp data

1167
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:46,400
we'd find that many isps at the edge

1168
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:49,040
give you 1500 or slightly less

1169
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,520
we know that from previous work so this

1170
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,359
isn't

1171
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,680
really a complete data set it just shows

1172
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:57,680
where one of the bottlenecks is

1173
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:59,759
if you're into content edge services

1174
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,839
and you have data for the mtu get to the

1175
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,079
content edge to akamai

1176
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,119
to cloudflare etc we'd love to talk to

1177
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,119
you that would be fun

1178
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,839
what's our takeaway for the hot buy hop

1179
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,520
option well this promise

1180
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,279
some paths do provide a big mtu

1181
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,800
and if you've got an isp that will

1182
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,359
support it then you could use it

1183
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:25,839
so it might be useful in the internet

1184
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:25,839
next slide

1185
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,759
there are other issues let's look at

1186
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,598
extension headers themselves

1187
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:35,280
if you could use the hot option to

1188
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:39,599
discover a big mtu or

1189
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:42,799
even just a small mtu

1190
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,119
how many pass support extension headers

1191
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,160
well we did quite a large survey but we

1192
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,960
used a dns

1193
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,920
server as target so udp packets to a dns

1194
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,319
server

1195
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,240
and of those paths about 30 percent of

1196
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,240
the path supported the extension header

1197
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,599
again it's not a

1198
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,680
bad piece of news it's probably an

1199
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,000
expected piece of use we probably want

1200
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,839
more

1201
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,839
data to other types of servers

1202
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:13,839
and we presented that data last ietf

1203
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,879
so for next ietf we'll have a better set

1204
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:16,720
of data

1205
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,720
we could dig into two of our probes and

1206
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,359
tell you what happened for two

1207
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,959
one was in the uk which appears to be

1208
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,598
quite a good place because the extension

1209
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,880
headers were

1210
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,920
fine the service provider forward them

1211
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,079
we could probe

1212
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,680
the internet from a home residential

1213
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,720
router one of them was in bob's house

1214
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,000
we talked about last iatf the operator

1215
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,279
was comcast i'm

1216
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,280
i'm really hopeful that we have a

1217
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,839
conversation with comcast to find out

1218
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:47,280
exactly what was happening

1219
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:49,839
and the news was summarized in this

1220
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,640
quote here so i'll read it so that i

1221
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,799
don't misrepresent what they said

1222
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,879
the routers punt extension headers to

1223
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:59,040
the control plane

1224
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,359
the control plane bandwidth is limited

1225
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,480
and can be impacted if excess

1226
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,240
transit extension headers

1227
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,599
traffic is forwarded in current

1228
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,759
implementation that means

1229
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,200
it's a good to filter transit packets

1230
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,040
that contain extension headers

1231
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,040
to protect the control plane capacity

1232
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,559
if you're in v6 hops you probably saw

1233
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,359
this

1234
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,839
same thing being discussed there in the

1235
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,839
draft i put at the bottom of the slide

1236
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,680
and it talks about more detail why that

1237
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:30,240
might be the case

1238
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,240
we looked also into firewall code and we

1239
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,040
found that at least for the firewalls we

1240
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,279
looked at

1241
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,480
the default action was to filter packets

1242
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:41,839
with extension headers

1243
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,839
since most web servers lie behind

1244
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,359
firewalls that might also give us an

1245
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:48,078
indication what happens when we probe

1246
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,078
web servers

1247
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,359
so we plan to look more at the edge see

1248
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,280
where extension headers work

1249
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,440
at the moment if you want to use the

1250
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,280
extension we

1251
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,680
advocating in this draft across the

1252
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,480
general internet it may or it may not

1253
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,440
work

1254
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,440
that in itself is not a disaster when it

1255
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,559
works it provides extra information when

1256
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,079
it doesn't work

1257
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,000
just be careful not to use it on a

1258
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,760
packet that you really care for use a

1259
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,319
probe packet to carry the extension

1260
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,839
header

1261
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:18,240
or you could use it in the general

1262
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,240
internet

1263
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,440
and yeah well obviously we're looking

1264
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,680
for more people to um

1265
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,440
look at this problem space because we'll

1266
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,598
be doing extensive measurements in the

1267
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:33,839
next period

1268
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,839
and we'd love to talk to you next slide

1269
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,078
oh next steps yeah that's where we got

1270
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:41,440
to so we have

1271
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:45,760
a working piece of code in vpp

1272
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,000
that adds the field modifies it updates

1273
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,160
it

1274
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,480
sends it up so we have one router

1275
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:54,480
that could do a proof that we can

1276
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,520
actually do something here we'd love

1277
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,799
more people

1278
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,839
to um implement this

1279
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:03,920
really really love to talk to you and

1280
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,960
see if we could do something the target

1281
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,359
place where this is

1282
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:08,319
most useful is likely within the data

1283
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:11,680
center

1284
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:13,680
within a data center big mtu is often

1285
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,040
supported the switches often have the

1286
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,359
support the routers

1287
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,400
might well have that support and this

1288
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,040
would actually

1289
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,559
be a big win to letting you immediately

1290
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,759
verify that the configuration of the

1291
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,200
device is on path

1292
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,559
matches what you expect so

1293
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,399
looking for people to implement the

1294
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,079
router side we're also

1295
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,559
looking for people who are interested in

1296
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,520
the host code

1297
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,640
you can use it in a very simple way and

1298
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,400
get the information out about your path

1299
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,640
would people be interested in talking to

1300
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,440
us about that we'll do that experiment

1301
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,240
as well please talk to us new data for

1302
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,880
march

1303
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,799
please read this version if i've said

1304
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,520
nothing else that's useful

1305
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,759
the version now is really readable and

1306
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,720
we don't know how to improve it

1307
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,720
so please tell us

1308
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,839
is that my last slide

1309
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:20,480
so please come to the to the microphone

1310
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,720
so while we're waiting for people to

1311
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,480
come um well here we have ron

1312
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:27,279
ron please go ahead oh it disappeared

1313
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,280
again um

1314
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,079
so gory how how do you see the

1315
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:34,078
you know do you want to see

1316
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,960
implementations

1317
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:38,640
of this sort of in parallel to to this

1318
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,960
document being advanced

1319
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,960
um

1320
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,200
while the experiments go on or do you do

1321
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:48,720
you see any

1322
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:49,359
issue with you know from my perspective

1323
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,359
this

1324
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,200
looks like we're almost done right that

1325
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:57,119
we could push this document

1326
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:59,279
forward and publish it but um

1327
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,760
yeah what do you what do you prefer what

1328
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,799
you see as the most

1329
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,599
successful path here for getting both

1330
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:09,440
deployment

1331
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:10,720
and and publication i'll talk first and

1332
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,640
then i think bob should talk because i

1333
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,919
don't know why we agree yet on this

1334
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:19,598
uh but um if people want

1335
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:22,240
to implement this right now i would

1336
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,160
love to talk to them because the more

1337
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,680
experience we get

1338
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,078
sooner the better everything's going to

1339
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:31,520
be so um

1340
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:33,839
no i would happily delay publication

1341
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,200
if there was active work to get this

1342
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:37,440
implemented and get

1343
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:38,319
experiments going with this then maybe

1344
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,240
it didn't happen

1345
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,558
be experimental perhaps i could push you

1346
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,240
to do a ps because we actually knew

1347
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,799
about it

1348
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,279
if that doesn't happen in the next itf

1349
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,839
cycle

1350
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,640
i think i'll be asking to publish anyway

1351
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,720
because

1352
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,000
the experiment is very clearly defined

1353
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,118
from my side

1354
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,040
so i would i would love to try and push

1355
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,400
this along but i'd happily delay that a

1356
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,440
little bit if i saw

1357
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,440
implementation work

1358
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,720
yep that makes sense bob yeah and i

1359
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,079
agree with that

1360
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,919
any other comments from the working

1361
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,920
group on this

1362
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:26,319
and if anyone wants to help out in the

1363
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,480
experiment by hosting probes

1364
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:30,480
uh i guess gory you are the contact for

1365
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,200
that right

1366
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,240
yep um we will put in touch with anna

1367
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,040
who's

1368
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,399
very helpful and she anna has a virtual

1369
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,680
version of the probe as well which runs

1370
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:43,280
in a virtual box so

1371
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,279
you don't actually have to take hardware

1372
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,598
right

1373
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,400
so we could have a very large number of

1374
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:54,640
probes

1375
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:55,440
and it would also be good to get probes

1376
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,839
in

1377
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,480
in some environments with larger mtus

1378
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,240
maybe

1379
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:06,720
like several inside of a particular

1380
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:09,359
isp or cloud provider andrew

1381
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,359
andrew yeah

1382
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:22,480
have you unmuted yourself andrew

1383
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:24,480
i wanted to check um with regards to

1384
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,880
those virtual probes any particular

1385
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,480
hypervisors anything else before i

1386
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,440
chase you up on this that's an easy

1387
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,359
answer

1388
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,760
please email us um it is probably better

1389
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:40,319
to talk to anna because she could

1390
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,079
um we can put you in touch and and she

1391
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:42,880
will quickly tell you what's involved

1392
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:47,119
she has a quick

1393
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:50,640
fact sheet and you can talk about which

1394
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,640
hypervisors etc work

1395
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,520
we could probably also send that out to

1396
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,359
the list

1397
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:59,359
unless it's some reason not to

1398
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:06,319
indeed well i think we can um

1399
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,160
we we we would just love to get more

1400
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,759
measurements

1401
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:14,399
cool okay uh super thank you

1402
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,240
corey then we're on to the next

1403
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,839
presentation i think um

1404
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:20,399
unless andrew are you still in the queue

1405
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:20,400
or uh

1406
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:30,240
i guess not super super sepi uh you are

1407
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:33,520
up let me just get your slides

1408
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:35,279
we can hear you okay you're a little

1409
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,319
faint but

1410
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,319
otherwise we can hear you

1411
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,839
okay uh can i grab

1412
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,000
please go ahead go ahead hello everybody

1413
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,558
uh this is an update about

1414
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,440
our draft on application of alternate

1415
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:57,039
markings so

1416
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:59,839
next live uh yeah just a quick recap

1417
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,240
regarding the methodology from whom is

1418
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,759
not

1419
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,078
very familiar with this kind of

1420
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:08,160
methodology so alternate markings

1421
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:11,520
allow a passive performance measurement

1422
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,598
technique to make measure packet loss

1423
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:18,160
delay and deliveration

1424
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:22,480
the reference document is the fca v21

1425
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:25,038
the basic idea is to batch the packet

1426
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,079
based on time interval or number of

1427
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,960
butter 2

1428
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,920
by switching the as plank this way you

1429
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,640
can create

1430
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:37,039
that bunch of packets over the network

1431
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,480
for single marking you can use the first

1432
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,720
and last packet to

1433
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:45,920
measure the delay delay variation

1434
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,160
otherwise you can add one more bit and

1435
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,760
that's why we are asking for two bits

1436
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:52,000
that is the delay bit

1437
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,240
that can be used to select some special

1438
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,880
packet that are dedicated

1439
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,078
uh for delay and are fully recognized

1440
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,119
over the metro

1441
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,119
so next slide

1442
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,078
uh the evolution of the basic alternate

1443
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,119
marking we

1444
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:12,160
present an indirect ch 321

1445
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,280
has been just published in the new rfc

1446
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,399
that is rfc 8889

1447
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,440
uh in this case the ultimate marking is

1448
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,720
extended for

1449
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:25,119
multi-point flows

1450
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,640
in this case you can also monitor the

1451
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,599
full network

1452
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,200
or otherwise you can select select the

1453
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,079
subnetwork

1454
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:35,520
to monitor at different levels this

1455
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,319
allows

1456
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,359
flexible performance management approach

1457
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:42,558
so you can go

1458
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:45,680
to monitor a sub network up to

1459
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:50,079
a single flow or a single link

1460
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:52,480
this is to introduce a flexible approach

1461
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,720
to the performance measurement in this

1462
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:57,760
case the packet loss can be measured

1463
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:01,279
on multi-point part basis or

1464
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:04,799
considering the single flows and the

1465
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:07,119
single link as in the 8321

1466
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:08,880
in the same in same way the delay

1467
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,760
measurement can also be done on

1468
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,960
multi-point path basis or on single part

1469
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,520
package basis so this is the flexibility

1470
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,079
is that you can decide based on the grid

1471
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:23,759
the degree

1472
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,760
of detail you need next is light

1473
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:32,079
so basically to apply this methodology

1474
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:33,759
in ipv6 world we need

1475
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,440
a marking field so this is the

1476
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,720
requirement

1477
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,720
in this regard we have

1478
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,480
we are requesting an option adder

1479
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,440
that can be a non-biop or destination

1480
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,000
based on the

1481
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,119
type of performance measurement you want

1482
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,200
to enable

1483
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,720
in general the source node is the only

1484
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,799
one that writes

1485
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,959
this option either to mark the flows

1486
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:01,200
but the intermediate or destination

1487
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:04,240
nodes passively receive

1488
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:07,680
and read these bits to perform the

1489
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:10,799
measurement but they did not modify

1490
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,520
they does not do not modify any field of

1491
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,559
the option

1492
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:17,440
ever but in case of biops and in the

1493
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,400
case of definition option

1494
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,400
so next slide

1495
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:26,160
yeah the this is the data field that is

1496
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,760
defined in this

1497
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,720
graph uh the so-called dalton my alt

1498
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,960
mark option

1499
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,000
is expected as i said to be to be

1500
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,960
encapsulated as

1501
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,920
of by offer definition option the the

1502
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,480
usual tlp format is shown in the slide

1503
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,680
and

1504
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,240
you can see the two bits l and d bits

1505
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,160
for the marking field and the new flow

1506
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,959
monitoring notification field that we

1507
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,960
are introducing

1508
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:59,359
next slide

1509
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,200
the reason for the introduction of this

1510
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:04,400
pro monitoring identification

1511
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,439
field is requirement for implementation

1512
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,200
reason

1513
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,200
because to allow

1514
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,520
a flexible measurement you have to

1515
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:16,480
reduce the per node configuration in

1516
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,399
order also

1517
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,519
to increase the number of flows that you

1518
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,719
want to monitor

1519
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,640
and the use of acl is limited

1520
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,319
so that's why it's better to have an

1521
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,839
identification field

1522
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,040
in the in our cld in addition it also

1523
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:34,399
simplifies the

1524
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,759
counters handling uh

1525
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:42,158
and also it facilitates and it is

1526
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,158
the data export so next

1527
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:49,679
uh yeah we had also some discussion

1528
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,799
about the uniqueness of the

1529
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:56,158
this field because it can be set

1530
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:59,120
by a centralized controller and

1531
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:01,358
the controller can have the construct

1532
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,120
the nodes in order to guarantee

1533
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:08,159
uniqueness of these into malignant pi

1534
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,000
otherwise it can be uh randomly

1535
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:13,920
generated by the source node but

1536
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:16,000
in this case there are some possibility

1537
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,080
to have the collision a chance of

1538
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,479
collision for example if we are going

1539
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,799
for

1540
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:22,479
20-bit flow monitor identification there

1541
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:25,679
is a 50

1542
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:28,959
chance of collision for 1 1 1

1543
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,440
200 flows so for more entropy and many

1544
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,080
cases

1545
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,399
we suggest to combine this

1546
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,479
identification with other identification

1547
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:39,679
flow information in the packet

1548
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:43,678
or the sites could be increased using

1549
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:43,679
reseller fields in some other way

1550
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:51,920
next

1551
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:55,360
oh man by the way i started a poll for

1552
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,960
how many people have read the draft

1553
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,839
okay thanks thank you um regarding the

1554
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,600
alternatives

1555
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:05,760
um you can see all the

1556
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,520
alternatives that are on the table so

1557
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,760
you can use the destination option to

1558
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,960
measure only by node in the definition

1559
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,080
address

1560
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,719
the opera option for every router on the

1561
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:17,120
path

1562
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,520
or you can combine the definition option

1563
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:22,080
plus any routing either for example

1564
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,840
ssh in this case you are monitoring

1565
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:27,519
every destination node in the

1566
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,159
root list you can prefer

1567
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,400
general in many cases when measurement

1568
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:35,839
is not enough so it could be required

1569
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,080
job by of measurement but even if

1570
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,320
for rob biops i know that there is some

1571
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,920
discussion about

1572
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,199
the applicability and in any case there

1573
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,960
is no problem because

1574
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:52,159
even if a non-part node uh does not

1575
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,560
is not configured to read this option uh

1576
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:56,320
the up by op is made only for the nodes

1577
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,719
that are configured to

1578
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,239
to read these option so this not this

1579
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:02,239
does not affect the measure

1580
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,679
yeah regarding the security

1581
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:11,360
consideration so

1582
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,600
there are of course some security

1583
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:15,519
concerns but are limited

1584
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,520
because the ultimate market implies

1585
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,239
modification on the fly

1586
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,239
to an option other so but in any case

1587
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:24,159
the information is very limited and this

1588
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:27,120
must be performed in a way that

1589
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,080
does not alter the qrs experience

1590
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:31,280
regarding the

1591
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,199
head to the measurement uh we are in a

1592
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,800
context in the context of a controller

1593
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:36,799
domain so

1594
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,840
the network know it is supposed that the

1595
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,719
network nodes are

1596
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,360
locally administrated and this type of

1597
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,320
attack

1598
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,080
can be avoided in addition an attacker

1599
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:48,880
cannot gain the information

1600
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,600
by using one single monitoring point but

1601
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,679
need

1602
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,760
synchronized monitoring points because

1603
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:57,760
this

1604
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:00,719
the difficulty to do this kind of uh

1605
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,960
attack regarding regarding the privacy

1606
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:04,719
are also limited because the method only

1607
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,800
relies on information in the option

1608
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:12,080
either without

1609
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,080
any release of use of that next life

1610
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:17,120
yeah the change from the last version we

1611
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,320
addressed the

1612
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,480
comment from ron uh about the time the

1613
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,519
timing aspect of this methodology

1614
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,759
because

1615
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,159
um yes i'm concerned about the

1616
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,239
resiliency of reordering but

1617
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,280
uh there is a mathematical formulation

1618
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:35,360
in both rfc

1619
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:38,559
321 and lx3889 about that

1620
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:39,839
and we also include a small paragraph

1621
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:42,719
that describes

1622
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,600
how the alternate marking means

1623
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:47,840
resilient to this kind of reality

1624
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:49,440
another comment was about the

1625
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,600
possibility

1626
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,519
to pick up one of the bits for

1627
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,000
cross-layer telemetry information for

1628
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,920
example quick and tcp

1629
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,040
in any case this is considered out of

1630
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,480
scope for now and

1631
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,800
could be evaluated in future when this

1632
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,239
quick tcp measurement will be also

1633
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,760
accepted in the

1634
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:10,159
relevant working loop we can also

1635
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,360
discuss this cross layer

1636
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:15,599
parametry information

1637
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,599
next

1638
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,120
into the last one yeah yeah regarding

1639
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,599
the learn the next steps yeah we can say

1640
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:25,199
that

1641
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,800
we are finding an agreed way to apply

1642
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:30,719
the

1643
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:34,239
two rfc to pv6 uh

1644
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:37,440
we can we have requested the jana

1645
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:39,360
we want to request the ana parameters to

1646
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,360
tell the implementation

1647
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:46,960
and of course the questions and comments

1648
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:51,120
are always

1649
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:54,719
okay thank you guys any uh any comments

1650
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:57,760
on this draft um so guiseppe you have

1651
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:01,920
have you made an early uh request

1652
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:05,199
for for to ayanna

1653
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,400
not yet because maybe we need your

1654
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:11,280
the approval from the trash like yeah

1655
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,839
i think the processes you basically ask

1656
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,440
us

1657
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,719
first okay yeah we can send you the

1658
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:19,280
details there's sort of a

1659
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:21,199
bit of a form to fill out and and we can

1660
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:28,159
get get that started

1661
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:30,400
eric just

1662
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:32,320
and and i guess the other questions i

1663
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,440
mean so this is a working group graph

1664
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,360
when do you think

1665
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:39,919
this will be ready to advance

1666
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,839
i think that in terms of content is

1667
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,239
quite stable

1668
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,760
we may discuss if we want to put some

1669
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:47,759
implementation details

1670
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,959
or we can but in terms of content or i

1671
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,440
guess it

1672
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,000
is quite stable maybe we have to refine

1673
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,559
something

1674
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,560
again but

1675
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:03,280
it's quite stable okay so it sounds like

1676
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:08,840
you're not quite ready but

1677
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:11,040
maybe soon it would be good to see this

1678
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,360
progress

1679
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,360
okay

1680
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:18,719
good so the

1681
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,520
yeah so the results of the polls show

1682
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,080
that 19

1683
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,199
people have read it and eight people

1684
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,679
said they didn't and

1685
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:35,839
74 people didn't respond so

1686
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,840
which is better than the other drafts

1687
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:44,080
yeah okay well good

1688
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,080
thank you thank you thank you

1689
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:50,839
well i think unless i'm

1690
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,040
forgetting the agenda i think we are

1691
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:55,840
done

1692
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:56,640
it's uh just to wait until prague then

1693
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,520
um

1694
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,600
hopefully we will try to make some

1695
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:05,120
progress between now and then

1696
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:06,960
um if things come up uh

1697
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:09,120
i guess the barrier to do interim

1698
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,880
meetings is lower now than

1699
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,440
than normal as well so we that's

1700
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:17,040
certainly something we could do if

1701
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:20,080
if it's required but otherwise we will

1702
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:23,120
virtually see you in prague

1703
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:26,640
corey has a uh a last

1704
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:28,640
word please go ahead corey

1705
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,920
sorry i was i'm very slow pressing the

1706
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,920
right buttons

1707
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,679
um no i just wondered whether people

1708
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:35,440
were actually reading the drafts not

1709
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:38,880
able to use the tool

1710
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:41,360
and maybe

1711
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,800
we just have to try and get eyes on on

1712
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,599
the drafts and get people to say that

1713
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,600
they've read things

1714
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,440
yes i think we can't conclude anything

1715
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:51,440
from

1716
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,719
from sort of the hand rising tool

1717
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,480
exercise i

1718
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:56,239
i guess we could have run them as we do

1719
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,678
hums where we

1720
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:02,159
declare the hand racing

1721
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,239
session for open and keep quiet for a

1722
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:06,799
minute and and wait instead of running

1723
01:17:04,239 --> 01:17:09,759
it in the background in parallel

1724
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,679
we try that as an experiment i can start

1725
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:17,840
another one

1726
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:17,840
because hold on let me type it in

1727
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,040
so we're now going to do a poll on how

1728
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:26,480
many people have read

1729
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:28,480
the path mtu discovery draft i'm not

1730
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,519
doing the alternate marking but we can

1731
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:33,599
help change all right

1732
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,600
okay yes that's good

1733
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,000
so the alternate marking we got 20 at

1734
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,199
reddit out of an eight didn't so it's

1735
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,760
it's a higher score okay so i started a

1736
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:47,040
second

1737
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:48,080
poll for the alternate marking one thing

1738
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:51,040
i've discovered is

1739
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,640
it's good to type the name of the draft

1740
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,400
when we ask these questions because

1741
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:57,040
it's then you can tell what the results

1742
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:58,719
mean afterwards

1743
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:02,320
and i guess we will not end this session

1744
01:17:58,719 --> 01:18:02,320
until we have 72 answers

1745
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,440
or sorry we have another outcome we

1746
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:07,120
could have everyone leaves and then we

1747
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:09,678
have the right number of answers

1748
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,040
that's right i wonder why we have 78

1749
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:14,080
participants and only

1750
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:18,000
72 in the in the hand tool

1751
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,000
yeah it's it's by the way

1752
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:28,239
oh

1753
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:30,080
i think that meet echo will certainly

1754
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:33,199
see the end of our poll if we don't

1755
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,199
if we don't take it in time

1756
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,640
yeah so we are getting more numb we are

1757
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,600
getting

1758
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,040
20 currently 21 and 14 which is better

1759
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,960
than before

1760
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:50,320
yeah so about this 50 response rate

1761
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:54,080
uh at this moment right so i'm gonna

1762
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,920
that's quite good i'm gonna end this and

1763
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:09,840
then i'm going to do another

1764
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:09,840
another poll for the pathmq

1765
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:25,440
okay i've now started that poll

1766
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,440
and i have read it

1767
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,920
yeah we're seeing much higher numbers

1768
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:40,000
and gory a few people have contacted me

1769
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,440
on the side here asking how they get uh

1770
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,280
contact details for anna

1771
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:44,879
perhaps you you want to send out an

1772
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,400
email to the list as well

1773
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:52,159
asking for um probe volunteers and

1774
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,159
and provide contact details

1775
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,159
any limitations of what kind of networks

1776
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,239
you want people to

1777
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:02,559
to have i was going to call my eyes

1778
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:06,320
call my isp and ask them to increase my

1779
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:10,639
mtu to non case and see what happens

1780
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:14,559
good yeah so the numbers here are

1781
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:20,159
slight went up and went down

1782
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:22,159
slightly better 14 and 12 out of 71.

1783
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:24,320
so i think it does work better to just

1784
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:26,559
call the question

1785
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,679
you know after the before or after the

1786
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,719
talk

1787
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:33,120
than to do it during the talk

1788
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,960
or else maybe it bill works better at

1789
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,159
the end of the session when people are

1790
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,920
tired

1791
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:42,320
when i go home but okay well good i will

1792
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,320
end this

1793
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:49,199
look good so i think we

1794
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:50,320

1795
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:53,919
good meeting

1796
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,880
two sessions um

1797
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,760

1798
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:01,440

1799
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:04,880

so thank you all very much and we will

1801

see or hear you on the list and

1802
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:14,400
hopefully in wherever

1803
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,360
the next ietf meeting is probably not

1804
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,159
face to face

1805
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,799
but maybe in the fall we will get to

1806
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:23,360

1807
