1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,039
okay

2
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,080
it is um the top of the hour

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,519
so we will go ahead and get started

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,519
um this is the

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,839
ntp working group at ietf109

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,840
um

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,079
the uh this is the ietf notewell for

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,199
those of you who

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,960
are new to the working group you will

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
have

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,440
acknowledged and accepted this when you

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,399
registered for the ietf

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
these are all of the rules and processes

14
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,480
by which

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,480
we operate

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,519
please

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,320
please check into them and make sure you

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,399
understand them

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,600
if you have any questions feel free to

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,640
ask

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,919
dieter or myself or

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:21,280
eric who is our responsible ad

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,840
[Music]

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
with that

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:32,000
we have a pretty short agenda today

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,920
uh first of all we have

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
this part of it the administrative and

28
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
agenda bashing session

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
we're going to talk about a number of

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,479
documents

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
what the status review is and next steps

32
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,000
for a number of documents that are in

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,119
flight these are documents that don't

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,119
really have any updates

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,960
we will talk about the alternative ntp

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,600
port document that we was accepted

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,600
recently

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
we'll talk

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,599
i put this down as ietf 109 hackathon

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,040
and then put a rough time report but

41
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,119
it's actually

42
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,400
both a report of what rough time did

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,000
at the hackathon and also

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
implications and next steps for the

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
rough time draft itself

46
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,119
um and then we'll talk about ntf

47
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,200
ntp v5 development rechartering in any

48
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,840
other business

49
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,839
is there any agenda bashing

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,120
no okay one thing i do need

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
is there anybody who's willing to take

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
notes

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,440
any minute takers

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,760
[Music]

55
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,359
i know dieter has agreed to do it but it

56
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,840
would be good if somebody else did it

57
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,840
with him

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,379
[Music]

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
a very quiet meeting today

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
um

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,120
okay um so ditcher i guess you

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
get the minutes

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
um

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,959
so the next uh so the first part of the

65
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,040
first agenda item

66
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,040
is uh our ntp working group status

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,000
um we have a couple documents that are

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,319
with the iesg now we have the

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:00,400
mode 6 commands and the yang data module

70
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,079
model so there's no updates to those yet

71
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
we also have two documents that are

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,400
ready for the iesg

73
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,840
that have not been submitted yet one is

74
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
the interleave modes

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,959
document and the second one is the ntp

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,798
port randomization

77
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,759
um and then i originally listed the next

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,719
two documents

79
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
as documents that we had no updates on

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
um

81
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
but we will have an update on rough time

82
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,199
based on the uh

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,159
i mean on the hackathon i just didn't

84
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:43,840
move it off this list so are there any

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:43,840
questions or comments on these documents

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
i apologize for being slow on the ad

87
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,159
evaluation parts

88
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,639
no problem i've had my own long list of

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
things i'm slow on at the moment

90
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,840
the um

91
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:15,199
okay so with that um

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,199
the next part of the agenda is the um

93
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
is watson he's going to talk about the

94
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,299
rough time hackathon experience go ahead

95
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,239
watch him

96
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,360
[Music]

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,280
i think you need to accept this oh do

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,639
you want to do the slides or

99
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
oh no i'm happy to let you do them i

100
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,440
just um hear all stuff

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,120
okay i think there's something you need

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
to do to accept the queue

103
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,639
yeah i just um got into the habit of

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
doing them all myself so i'm happy to

105
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,758
sound so great it looks like that's

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
working

107
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,240
all right so i'll be discussing rough

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,960
time the rough time hackathon experience

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,960
and the next steps in the protocol

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,719
i noticed that a number of people are

111
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,680
new

112
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,039
so i'll give a quick recap of rough time

113
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
so it's essentially certificate

114
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,440
transparency for

115
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,479
time by signing the responses

116
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,600
and incorporating announcing the queries

117
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,000
we can provide proof that the queries

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,639
were

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,160
responded to in a causal order and

120
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,800
the res the servers are testing at the

121
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
generation within an interval

122
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
if these intervals are inconsistent with

123
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,400
cut with the evidence of causality

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
then we know that at least one server

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,120
was lying when it said that it generated

126
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,199
the response at that time

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
and this can then lead to a distrust of

128
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,919
the server

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
and this is a intended to provide a much

130
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,039
stronger security guarantees

131
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,479
for an approximate time with

132
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,199
applications to

133
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
signature verification i've heard of

134
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,360
interest in iot

135
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,599
uh time synchronization security

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
obviously but it's not going to be as

137
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,479
accurate as you might want

138
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,160
it will however ensure at the time is

139
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,919
correct

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,280
um and one of the wrinkles in this is

141
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,479
you need a monotonic time representation

142
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,000
because you want to have the case that

143
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
you can compare the timestamps and

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
you'll always have a later

145
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,759
a causally later timestamp

146
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,039
be a numerically greater value and to

147
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
adopt this

148
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,360
we use a representation based on the

149
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,919
modified julian date

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,639
and microsecond since midnight so

151
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,159
there's a number

152
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,080
there's some bit packing that goes on

153
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,360
where some of the bytes are are

154
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,039
allocated for regular science since

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,599
midnight and some are allocated to the

156
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,719
modified julian date

157
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,440
so i meant the hackathon

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
so worker cloudflare and cloudflare has

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,280
a client and server implementation and

160
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
there's now a branch that

161
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,479
implements the rough time version 3

162
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,280
draft

163
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,199
there's still work to be done on

164
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,039
updating the interfaces with some of the

165
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
changes that have happened in the draft

166
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,840
and

167
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,960
fixing some of the usability issues

168
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,758
around the library that we provide

169
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,838
um but that you know general cleanup but

170
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,399
it does implement it

171
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,959
and the server interoperated within it

172
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
with a

173
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:44,079
client from johann um

174
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,360
there were some issues we identified so

175
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,880
modified julian date in order to compute

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,640
it you need to know whether or not

177
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,880
you're in a leap second

178
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,279
and that information is known to the

179
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,680
kernel on unix-like systems

180
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
but there is no portable interface to

181
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,519
obtain it

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:05,360
so depending on exactly where you're

183
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,680
implementing this

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
that can be an issue linux has an

185
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,399
interface

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,080
sort of round about what you have to do

187
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
whether it's there

188
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
and it's a matter of getting other

189
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,560
operating systems to

190
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
support some kind of nicely designed

191
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,079
interface to get that information

192
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,160
out so what's remaining with the draft

193
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
so there there's an area that's been a

194
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,800
sort of to-do list for a while

195
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,080
which is the um

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,839
transfer of proofs of server malfeasance

197
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
we need to wait we need to serialize

198
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,040
them and

199
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,320
there needs to be some idea of where you

200
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,599
send them um

201
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
if you're interested in deploying

202
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,560
roughly i want to hear from you even

203
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,839
something like

204
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,959
this is fine would be very useful i i

205
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,720
think at that point

206
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,640
we'll we'll sort of be ready for a

207
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,480
working glass call didn't find any

208
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,839
issues with interoperability i don't

209
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
think

210
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,320
uh from from the draft tax that's pretty

211
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,399
pretty nice

212
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,519
uh some particular areas of concern so

213
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:16,959
i mentioned earlier that

214
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,160
there was this problem with minimum with

215
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,040
getting the information out of the

216
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,160
kernel well if your minimum you can only

217
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,719
that only changes the time by one second

218
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,719
so is is having a server say okay i only

219
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,120
know the time within a second

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
i am just using get time a day enough or

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,200
maybe it needs to be a little

222
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,480
it needs to be a little bigger um

223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
with a modified julian date

224
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,880
representation the arithmetic depends on

225
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
leap second tables

226
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
because you need to know what the last

227
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,719
second of the day is

228
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,720
and when there is a

229
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,680
i'm going to mess with the sign

230
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,279
convention i know whatever i say it's

231
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,079
going to be wrong

232
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,880
so when you have a a second repeated

233
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,680
because the

234
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,200
earth has spun slower than expected the

235
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,040
last second of the day repeats its end

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
you need to know whether what the last

237
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,599
seconds number is

238
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,599
uh there's also invalid representations

239
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,079
the number of seconds in a day is not a

240
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,519
power

241
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,920
of two and because it is not a power of

242
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,800
two

243
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,719
there are a number of values that should

244
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,760
never appear

245
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,680
and the invitation when you program this

246
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,360
is to do your arithmetic on a degenerate

247
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,839
representation just

248
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
take the set microseconds part and add

249
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,680
in the timestamp

250
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,839
normalize afterwards this introduces

251
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,000
differences in the results you get

252
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
and implementation behavior and so i

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
need to say more about that and then

254
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,680
this wrinkle i thought of

255
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,920
is sort of signature canonicalization

256
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
what happens if a server produces

257
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,279
signatures that

258
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,479
some parties verify and others do not

259
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,959
uh can this be used to lie and get away

260
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,959
with it

261
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,560
so that's sort of the standards thing

262
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
and i want to talk about sparrows

263
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,760
deployment

264
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,439
currently the deployment picture is

265
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
pretty bleak there's a small number of

266
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,800
earlier versions deployed mostly of the

267
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,480
google

268
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
version that was kicking around for

269
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,399
madame langley

270
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,079
not enough financial three servers i i

271
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,279
think there's exactly one of them and

272
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,359
it's not working right now and got

273
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,760
restarted every day

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,040
um and there need to be places to report

275
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
malfeasance there needs

276
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:36,319
and we also need clients and just

277
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,399
as a this is a

278
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
certificate verifying client needs to

279
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,360
have policies certificates

280
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:47,839
verifies or a certificate transparency

281
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,440
implementation a client that uses

282
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
certificate transparency needs to trust

283
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,120
her in logs

284
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,920
the client in in rough time needs to

285
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,720
have a policy of acceptable servers

286
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:04,800
and that is a bit of an obligation

287
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,839
and it's so that that is something it

288
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,760
needs to at some point happen

289
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
um are there so at this point i think

290
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,639
i'll open the floor to questions if

291
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:21,839
there are any because

292
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:21,839
that's sort of us done with the summary

293
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,839
okay are there any questions

294
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,519
i have a question um but you

295
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,199
you mentioned some areas of concern

296
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,680
but you all also mentioned that you

297
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,519
think

298
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
this draft is waiting for working group

299
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
plus calls so

300
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,480
uh ah okay i i think i misspoke

301
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
what i said is i think that those are i

302
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
think after those are addressed it would

303
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,479
be ready

304
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,399
okay and if if people see a

305
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
show now i have ideas to address all of

306
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,560
them but if people think that no these

307
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,199
are actually

308
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,219
bigger problems or they have input now

309
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:19,439
would be the time to speak up

310
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,800
[Music]

311
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,839
so watson the um

312
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:31,839
during the hackathon did you get um any

313
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:35,440
participants in your project

314
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:37,920
uh yes um johan lindquist

315
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
uh showed up and his client

316
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,040
interoperates with the

317
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,399
with the server so that is

318
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,920
good okay

319
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,000
i i saw that you were using his

320
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:59,360
implement his client i did

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,800
i guess i didn't make the connection um

322
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
all right any other questions about

323
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,359
rough time

324
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,240
do you have a rough estimate on uh

325
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,279
the the time that you think

326
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,040
like what's your next plan for your next

327
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,360
update

328
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
um

329
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,880
i'd like to say as soon as the

330
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,320
submission window reopens

331
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:30,560
but uh i

332
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,680
that's that might be me being too

333
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,239
optimistic

334
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,239
um probably within the month

335
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,120
okay i i think the submission window

336
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,519
reopens on the first day of the ietf

337
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,360
meeting doesn't it

338
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,920
i think that's today okay then we'll

339
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
make that

340
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
okay um

341
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:12,880
okay so let's go back to

342
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,040
uh so there's no other questions on the

343
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,480
rough time work

344
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,880
okay uh

345
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:27,920
so on ntp v5 development uh

346
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:31,199
work we do not have um

347
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,040
a published draft what we do have

348
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,040
is a draft in

349
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,839
uh

350
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,119
and github i'm going to put a couple

351
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:50,399
links in the

352
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:52,880
chat for people um

353
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,480
so this is the contribution from

354
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,680
marislav that will

355
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,480
get submitted at some point uh the other

356
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,639
thing that i wanted to point people to

357
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,839
was um

358
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,039
the track

359
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,280
um the wiki

360
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,720
uh which we haven't updated in a while

361
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,720
but if you look at the wiki there's

362
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,319
a potential ntp work items and there's

363
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,959
basically

364
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,599
a list of version 4 issues and a version

365
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,600
5 feature requests

366
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,639
marislav is not on the call so he can't

367
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,399
really at least

368
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,840
let me double check i didn't see him

369
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,840
earlier

370
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
um

371
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,480
[Music]

372
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,960
and i don't see him on the call at all

373
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
uh so

374
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,480
um

375
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,080
and and so i guess the the since

376
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
miroslav is not on the call he can't

377
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,559
talk to his

378
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
uh contribution that was sent to the

379
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,360
mailing list

380
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,480
um has anybody on the call read it and

381
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,479
would like to discuss it

382
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,960
yeah so watson here um i read it i sent

383
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,120
a

384
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,679
email to the mailing list with comments

385
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,239
i don't i think at this point it's

386
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,880
pretty

387
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:26,240
early to say much about it um

388
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,320
it's in part because it intro

389
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,600
it talks a lot about the data format but

390
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,720
doesn't talk about

391
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,439
gathering for some of the more

392
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,440
interesting extensions

393
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
uh but i i think it's in

394
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,880
reason you know i think it's in

395
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
reasonably good shape for your starting

396
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,760
point

397
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:50,080
okay i think

398
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:53,520
um one of the concerns is

399
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,080
it narrows the scope from ntp v4 and

400
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
we're gonna

401
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,439
we're gonna need to have a serious

402
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,160
conversation about

403
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,160
uh backward compatibility at some point

404
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,280
i also think that

405
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,400
it might be

406
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:32,720
important that ntp

407
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:36,400
version 5 will start and secured

408
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,400
association by default

409
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,840
but that at some point we have to

410
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
discuss i suppose

411
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,320
okay watson yeah um

412
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,080
i'm not sure what was meant by narrowing

413
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,678
the scope if

414
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,760
i i think there was some degree of

415
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,559
agreement that we should specify

416
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,200
the network lay in the network wire

417
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,559
format

418
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,679
and the algorithms for steering somewhat

419
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,280
independently

420
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,280
uh basically split split the

421
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
current structure where it's algorithms

422
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,879
for treating the clock and the network

423
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,080
protocol in one big document

424
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,480
and split it up in part because we

425
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,970
of operational experience where you can

426
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,280
use other algorithms that works fine

427
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,360
[Music]

428
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,960
right that's not actually what i meant i

429
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,678
do believe there was agreement to do

430
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,679
that

431
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:36,720
um i

432
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,000
was in particular talking about like

433
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,120
reducing it to

434
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,400
server client mode only as opposed to

435
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,840
supporting other types of operations

436
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,840
other modes of service um

437
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,210
[Music]

438
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,520
i guess scope is not really the right

439
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,720
word but

440
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,520
um deprecating some features that are

441
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,280
not

442
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,559
being used as much now

443
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,080
as but that are part of the original

444
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,840
specification so that's

445
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,840
more what i meant by narrowing the scope

446
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,039
um

447
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,059
any other comments on

448
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,059
[Music]

449
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
the ntp v5 development

450
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:42,840
[Music]

451
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,320
we have a number of new participants

452
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,760
here

453
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,760
so i mean feel free to speak out

454
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,200
[Music]

455
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
if you have any questions at all

456
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,399
all right the last thing that on the

457
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,360
agenda was

458
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,360
oh go ahead doug

459
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,600
doug did you intend to put yourself in

460
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,600
the queue

461
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,600
just just hit the speak

462
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,440
there you go here we go okay great uh so

463
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,199
i

464
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,840
i just wanted to follow up on that last

465
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,840
comment about

466
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,840
other modes of operation

467
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,360
and the possibility of

468
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,559
marking marking them as you know

469
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,280
no longer recommended or something

470
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,720
uh you know i think i think this is a

471
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,120
discussion worth having

472
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,200
you know we want backwards compatibility

473
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,399
but we could say

474
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,400
we're phasing these loads out

475
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,120
they are allowed in this version but

476
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,559
they they may not be in future versions

477
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,719
it's

478
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,320
you know so deprecated might be

479
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,840
appropriate but that's

480
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
you know that's a choice for this group

481
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:23,600
to make but i think that's a

482
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:27,039
discussion we could have

483
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,918
all right um

484
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,919
i guess i'm

485
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
i guess what i've encouraged people to

486
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,439
do would be to write drafts even if

487
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
they're not

488
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,520
like protocol proposals if they're

489
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,080
drafts exploring what the requirements

490
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,679
should be or those kinds of things

491
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,799
we've used the wiki

492
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,320
over the years to try and

493
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,320
collect all the requirements

494
00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:03,279
and but we don't we aren't having a good

495
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:06,320
um we haven't had enough discussion

496
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,120
to make any consensus calls on like

497
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,879
things like

498
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,439
whether things should be deprecated or

499
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,440
not so

500
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,640
it would be helpful to have some of that

501
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,639
discussion

502
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:25,360
um all right anything else on ntp v5

503
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,360
i still don't see

504
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,480
marislav um

505
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,360
so the last point of the agenda was

506
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:39,360
rechartering we have

507
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,918
been promising some rechartering texts

508
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,918
for a while

509
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,279
but we have not

510
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,880
done that yet um

511
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,840
i just had that open

512
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,240
i have created an ether pad to start

513
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,480
collaborating we got some volunteers

514
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,279
at our last virtual interim to work on

515
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
the

516
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:07,679
to work on some chartering text and uh

517
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,760
we did not make any progress on that

518
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,760
that's mostly my fault for not uh

519
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
pulling it together

520
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,799
so what i'd like to do is work on that

521
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,799
for the next virtual interim

522

561
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
much sense to try and get it in in

562
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
