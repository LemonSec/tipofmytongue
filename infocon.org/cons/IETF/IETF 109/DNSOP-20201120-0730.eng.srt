00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
or so

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,080
begin actually

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
so so we we don't have much to say

9

and we'll just kick in right away with

10
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
stuff so suzanne if you want to kick to

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
uh benno is getting better he's on the

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,239
mend so that's good

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,920
he's recovering from this thing yeah

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,599
okay we can go ahead and get into it now

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
that i have figured out the unmute

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
button

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,920
yeah so we're gonna show all right

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,360
um we can go ahead and swing right into

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
it then

21
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,039
so if you want to kick to the next slide

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,399
yep

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,559
there we go there's that one um

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
of course and then one more the note

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,000
well with our policy procedures you

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,439
should have probably seen this a whole

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
bunch by now

28
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,600
give it give it a look through let's

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,798
jump to the next one

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,119

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
william has done his work so it's up to

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,240
you now okay

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,240

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,000
yes yes when was the new version

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,200
submitted

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,600
um just a couple hours ago

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
never mind back under rock right yep

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
okay thank you sir

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,880
this is how we communicate with our area

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
director so

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
thanks um and our agenda is um william's

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
gonna talk he's got some hackathon

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,439
results he wants to

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,680
to give out and then we've got three

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,639
three new new pieces of work sort of

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
thing so

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,079
um there you go and we'll just kick

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,439
right into that willem if you're ready

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
yeah let me grab the slide

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,560
oh can i present myself um

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
just give it a shot okay give it a shot

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
see what happens

55
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,760
okay okay let me shut off sharing then

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,239
give me just a second this is why we

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,679
don't

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
always do that all right there

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
you should be able to share now there

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,599
you go

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,329
uh

62
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,329
[Music]

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,200
enter screen queue it says

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,200
oh

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,879
yes i really want to share

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,400
and then this one all right so these are

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
the results from the

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,440
dns hackathon

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
okay

70
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,239
so recently the dns orc the dns

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,359
operations

72
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,720
and analyzers research center set up

73
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,800
a chat service and

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,920
many of the people that i would normally

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,959
meet at the hackathon table are in there

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,280
so i thought it would be good

77
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,640
to ask there if people wanted to

78
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,879
participate

79
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
in the hackathon there's also a public

80
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,159
channel so i've put it on the

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,000
hackathon wiki page as well so people

82
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,519
that were not already on this chat

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
surface

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,640
could join as well and 14 signed up

85
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,000
which is maybe not as as much

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,200
as a in-person hackathon but still a

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,879
good number

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,518
uh though you have to unlike

89
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
the in-person hackathon people were also

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
still

91
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,400
just working and having meetings and you

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,799
know so it was a bit of

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,200
in between a fierce thing

94
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
well the first hack we worked on was the

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,399
dns air reporting

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,518
roy will present on the draft later but

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,120
it's basically like

98
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,000
extended dns errors but instead of

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,918
reporting to the querier the errors are

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,600
reporting to the authoritative

101
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,159
where the broken thing is

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
so here you see how that chat surface

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,639
worked in practice

104
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,359
roy asked for do you know about broken

105
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,560
zones

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
which a few people responded on and then

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
he

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
requested if someone maybe could write

109
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,280
the authoritative

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,198
side of this draft and soon to set and

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,638
done

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,840
this was written in nsd and

113
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,600
is currently running on ns

114
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,119
and on lobster data now so if you send

115
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,680
the option

116
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,280
or at least the option with id 51281

117
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,919
which will act like the option it

118
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,758
reports a

119
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,560
server to which you can submit the error

120
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,960
and also which in this case is reported

121
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
in

122
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,039
labs.now and on that server i

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,039
um so the errors will normally be

124
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,000
reported with the dns query

125
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,639
so this server will show the log of the

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,520
dns

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,960
queries it sees so it can help with the

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,080
development of this option

129
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
in resolvers

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:38,080
so resolver implementations

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
should be not that hard given that not

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,240
parodinus

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
inbound all have extended dna's arrow

134
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,160
branches already

135
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,680
so but also

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
during the hackathon there's a lot of

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,320
discussion about this

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
focused discussion about those standards

139
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,639
and

140
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,840
so we wondered how

141
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
authoritative would respond if resolvers

142
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,080
would just

143
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,280
use that option and how we could measure

144
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,880
what the impact will be if that would be

145
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
done so that's a good result as well i

146
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,479
think

147
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,039
future research into what the impact

148
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,080
will be for this option

149
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,280
another hack we did was the

150
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,520
message digest for dns sounds

151
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,318
there was already an excellent proof of

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,479
concept

153
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
implementation written by duane

154
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,840
in with ldns but it was a bit cumbersome

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,639
and at the hackathon we made the

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,599
implementation integrated with ldns

157
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,199
cyanzone and

158
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,280
ldns ferris phi zone

159
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,080
and then uh it was already

160
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,239
friday and the hackathon was over but

161
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,359
before the hackathon

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,759
some of the participants wanted to work

163
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
on interoperability testing for the

164
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,800
catalog

165
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,440
challenge so we decided we would

166
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,440
continue

167
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
over the weekend with the hackathon and

168
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,319
also last week

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,679
with interoperability testing

170
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
for catalog zones

171
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,759
yeah so here's the text saying well we

172
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,120
could still continue

173
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,120
trying to do this next week

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,400
because not has the draft

175
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
implemented at least the interpretation

176
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
of catalog zones

177
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,080
since version 3 which is released

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,440
last september and powerdns already had

179
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,359
a proof of concept

180
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,039
hack called powercats based on mukund's

181
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,560
original draft

182
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,479
which was created four years ago

183
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:58,080
only nsd did not have implementation yet

184
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,280
but the eight years ago

185
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,680
enantlobs would have a product which was

186
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,599
called

187
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,800
credence which would was based on nsg3

188
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,719
which allowed a zone to be verified

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,599
before it would be served and this was

190
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
basically it was just nsd which spawned

191
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,280
a

192
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
external program like ldns verify zone

193
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,318
or

194
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,878
velatiness and if that would return

195
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,919
successfully then it would be served

196
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,039
so the last one and a half years we've

197
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,478
worked on porting this to nsd4

198
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,519
and i've used this branch to interpret

199
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,760
catalog sounds and

200
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,760
deploy the zones in the catalogue

201
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,120
accordingly

202
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,920
for that also i wanted to request a

203
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,959
domain name

204
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,560
for interoperability testing the

205
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,518
sounds.cat domain and luckily it was the

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
15 years anniversary of the cat top

207
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,480
level domain

208
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,599
so i could get the domain with a

209
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,080
discount for

210
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,959
only 5 euros i did have to argue how

211
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
this was

212
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,880
connected with catalunya but i just said

213
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,440
well it's for a testing interoperability

214
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,880
of catalog sounds and

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,480
that was fine too oh

216
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,279
so here you have example in how

217
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
that feature of verifying before serving

218
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,560
in

219
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
nsd is configured so you see that it's

220
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,479
calling

221
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,680
the ldns verify zone

222
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
and in below there's a piece of the log

223
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
file

224
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,360
showing that it successfully not only

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,719
verified the insect but also the zone

226
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,720
md record in zones.get

227
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,760
yeah so i decided to also use that

228
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:57,120
domain name or we decided to report on

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,560
all the things which are going on

230
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,640
surrounding zone md so here you have the

231
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
results of

232
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,399
interoperability testing between all the

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,200
different implementations

234
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,440
and that worked well i think

235
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,480
and there was also interesting

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
discussion

237
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,200
on if it would be

238
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,360
uh a good idea to

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,760
convey the serial number of the zones in

240
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,959
the catalog with the catalog zones

241
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,319
but i think we have to post a message to

242
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,680
the dns op list

243
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,399
so that you can

244
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,640
or we can all discuss this amongst each

245
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,640
other

246
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,760
so what we learned so it was not the

247
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,120
same

248
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,040
as an in-person hackathon in person

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,240
hackathon has better ad-hoc

250
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,599
conversations and social interaction

251
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,680
uh people are not working or on other

252
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,920
things at the same time but i think it

253
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,120
was still worth it

254
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,319
because we had some implementers focus

255
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,279
on the standards and

256
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,399
yeah i think we gave good input to the

257
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
work group

258
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
so that's basically it here you see the

259
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,600
list of people

260
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:29,839
that participated and

261
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,839
that ends my presentation

262
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,680
back to you susan and tim yeah yeah

263
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,439
um any questions comments ideas for what

264
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,880
to do next time

265
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
for the hackathon all right i don't see

266
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
anybody in the queue so

267
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,880
can uh go on to the next let me just

268
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,920
queue up the let me get the screen share

269
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,839
going and it's

270
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,839
roy aaron's and error reporting

271
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:12,160
all right and that should be visible

272
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,440
right yes can you hear me

273
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,120
yep great so good morning good evening

274
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
good afternoon good night for some of

275
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
you

276
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,519
um this is a presentation about the

277
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,760
draft that i've written with matt larson

278
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,680
about dns error reporting and the idea

279
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,720
is based on extended dns are also

280
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,319
reporting

281
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,600
instead of not instead next next to

282
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
reporting to the

283
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
stop resolver maybe this information can

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
go to an

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,800
authoritative server so

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
next slide please

287
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,089
[Music]

288
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,160
so what is what is the problem so this

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
is a bit of a story

290
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,240
and you all know this but i'm going to

291
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,560
tell you anyway and the dns is loosely

292
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,399
connected fault tolerant configuring go

293
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,319
and any warnings and errors are buried

294
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,200
in logs of recursive resolvers

295
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,560
and we we all know this and then came

296
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
dnsec

297
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,839
next slide please

298
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,519
and with dnsec um dns still loosely

299
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,760
connected

300
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,360
a little bit more error prone and you

301
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,439
don't need to stay

302
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
as you configure it because things might

303
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,279
go

304
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,480
badly and still any warnings and errors

305
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,560
are buried in the lack of recursive

306
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
resolvers and because of all this the

307
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,479
dns is slightly more

308
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,479
next slightly slightly more fragile

309
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:38,000
um so what is it that we can do about

310
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
this um next slide please

311
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,120
um and with this i mean this is the real

312
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,800
issue that these things these warning

313
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
and errors are still buried in lots of

314
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
recursive results we want to get it

315
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,519
we really get fixed not very so

316
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,360
what is the real problem statement that

317
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,680
i'm trying to fix um next slide

318
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,160
um the problem is when a resolver

319
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,880
encounters an error and does nothing

320
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,360
right um it it it's not that it does

321
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,920
nothing

322
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
it can now report to the to the end user

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,719
using

324
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,239
extended dns errors it's not that it

325
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
does not it should do nothing

326
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,040
in terms of resolving more because if

327
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,519
it's broken a resolver can't fix it

328
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,519
so in a sense that's good but we want to

329
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,240
sorry i i thought i was interrupted

330
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,480
um villain can you take your mic off

331
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,639
please

332
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,160
thank you okay so um

333
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,639
next slide please there you go

334
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,240
thank you what if the resolver can

335
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,000
notify the operator

336
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,760
slash domain owner now that's

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
that's an interesting thought of course

338
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,120
um at least i think so

339
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,560
um but before we do that sorry next

340
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
slide please before we do that

341
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,638
there are some requirements that we need

342
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,680
to keep in mind um since the channel is

343
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,160
already hurting

344
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,920
and the reporting should be very

345
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
lightweight

346
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,199
we shouldn't have any additional

347
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,959
complexities we don't want to send email

348
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,719
for every error we don't want to create

349
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,040
pdfs no who is lookups no

350
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
shaming no sending to mailing lists etc

351
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,000
cetera

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
we don't want to have any guesswork um

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,600
we um because we basically don't know

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
who owns what domain

355
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
um no guessing what the cost of the

356
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959
failure actually may be

357
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
so no heuristics no trial and error

358
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,239
cetera et cetera

359
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,119
next slide please so how are we going to

360
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,160
do this

361
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,720
well we'll set an error report and

362
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,160
all right where you want to send this

363
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,360
but we can send it to the authority

364
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,719
server of the broker domain

365
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,040
because it's broken right

366
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
and we also can't send it to the owner

367
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
of the domain because we have no clue

368
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
who that is

369
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,839
remember we don't want to burden the

370
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
poor resolver with securities

371
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
rdap et cetera et cetera rich emo

372
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
clients all but nonsense

373
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,040
so we're going to introduce a new

374
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,040
concept here next slide please

375
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:10,240
and that's the reporting agent

376
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,240
and uh sorry next slide please

377
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
i i just saw i just started the term

378
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,040
idiots before my name

379
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,680
sorry it was not that funny

380
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,800
anyway especially not early morning um

381
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,959
so

382
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,959
um how are we going to send this well

383
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,638
we're going to send an error report to a

384
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,199
reporting agent and this error report is

385
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,759
just another dns query

386
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,959
so how do we send this to the reporting

387
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,720
agent how do we learn about this

388
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,959
reporting agent because we don't want to

389
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,160
do another round trip to a broken

390
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,239
server well

391
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
every query can basically have an edna

392
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
zero option right that basically

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,519
indicates that the resolver can handle

394
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,959
this kind of reporting if the

395
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,800
authoritative server

396
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,160
then indicates it can do this reporting

397
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,719
as well then it can include

398
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,680
piggyback basically a reporting agent

399
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,839
domain

400
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,678
in the edna zero option next slide

401
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,959
please

402
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,679
well then what happens well if the

403
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,520
if the if the response can't be computed

404
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,120
or can be dealt with

405
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,359
or is it basically presents an error

406
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,280
then the resolver can send a query

407
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,918
that's

408
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,720
set up as follows it basically has a bad

409
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,880
q name

410
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
the q the q name it asks for where it

411
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,520
got a broken response to

412
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,480
and then an underscore error as a

413
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,918
separator

414
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,799
and then the agent domain which is in

415
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,200
this case a01.error.com

416
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,799
um that a1.error.com basically learned

417
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
for you an edna zero option i

418
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
apologize i should have used example.com

419
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,360
i will change that for the next

420
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,559
presentation

421
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
um and it can also prepend the queue

422
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,399
type and error but but

423
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,879
you can you get the idea so all of these

424
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
responses

425
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
sorry all of these

426
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
error reports that are sent out the

427
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,840
responses that can be cached

428
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,760
and that caching then helps again

429
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,199
sending too many reports

430
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,520
and i don't want to i don't want to

431
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
specify too deeply how resolve should i

432
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,480
do this

433
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,120
because that's up to the resolver itself

434
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
um

435
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,239
but the um the reporting agent is

436
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,879
basically an

437
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,600
intermediary and there's an analogy to

438
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,280
that and that's

439
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,439
um intermediaries for for dmarc and

440
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,440
i i assume some of you know how dmarc

441
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
works and so i'm not going to go into

442
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,240
that

443
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,600
but that's that's where the concept

444
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,960
stems from

445
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,959
um next slide please

446
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,080
so does that really work um in the real

447
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,000
world well on the reporting part

448
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,080
um we um and i say we as um

449
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,280
me and a few colleagues when we did the

450
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,480
trust tanker

451
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,320
rollover um with with the community we

452
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,960
had reports going to

453
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,960
root servers

454
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,000
about which truss anchor uses that

455
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
configure and so the reporting part

456
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
actually works

457
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,320
and what these root servers then

458
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,360
subsequently did these authoritative

459
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,799
subsequently did

460
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,000
is um sent a sent a report to a

461
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,440
dedicated nameserver by

462
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,200
appending rc8145.vsiken.org

463
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,840
to a trust anchor report so that that

464
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,000
that kind of reporting does work um in

465
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,240
in

466
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
at least for the trust center part uh on

467
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,760
the indiana zero part

468
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,159
uh well indian zero options do work so

469
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,520
there's really nothing new here

470
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
um of course there are many little

471
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,520
caveats that i in theory

472
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,959
theory i could go into that now but i

473
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
don't have time for that

474
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,320
so there are many little caveats

475
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,639
documented in the draft

476
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,520
i've talked to a few friends and

477
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,799
colleagues

478
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,120
about about this idea and

479
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,280
many of you have come with interesting

480
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,360
security privacy related things i hope

481
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,000
i've included that now all in the

482
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,918
in the draft and it will the next

483
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,760
version will come out soon

484
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:06,000
um we

485
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,640
oh sorry next slide please um

486
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,080
so what else is there um so what's with

487
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,520
the underscore error label

488
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
we need to have separated between the

489
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,000
reporting agent and the reported query

490
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,679
and what else is in that report while

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,520
the queue type in the error

492
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
and which errors are we talking about

493
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,039
those that are in extended dns errors

494
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,158
now to be fair um those are not exactly

495
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,400
the same thing

496
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,360
because a what you send to a client is

497
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,400
basically sorry what you send to a stop

498
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,479
resolver those are basically the errors

499
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,559
that you find out after the whole

500
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,360
resolving has been done

501
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,320
um but that might not necessarily be the

502
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,520
same that you sent

503
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:49,439
to an authority server when a

504
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,120
query resulted in a broken response or a

505
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
response that can't be computed et

506
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,639
cetera et cetera so

507
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,320
and there's a whole lot in them in

508
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,440
extended dns errors that we can

509
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,158
recycle here um so much so that i don't

510
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,840
think

511
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,840
i don't think it's necessary to open yet

512
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,280
another registry with new types of

513
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,280
errors

514
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,720
um so um

515
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,720
we already had um um

516
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,080
last week during the hackathon a bit of

517
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,440
progress on them

518
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,280
on this draft with regards to

519
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,120
implementations um

520
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,120
so william has talked about that so

521
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,840
thank you all who participated

522
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,039
and well with that i don't have anything

523
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,439
more to to talk about

524
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,280
with this draft so i'll guess i'll give

525
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,440
the mic back to you

526
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,440
thanks so jonathan

527
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,879
yep um thank uh it's an interesting

528
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,039
draft uh

529
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
i i have some questions wondering if

530
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,600
there's any data

531
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
around uh how often there's a failure

532
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,678
such that the authoritative is able to

533
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
respond well enough to give a reporting

534
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,400
domain but not able to actually give the

535
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,600
answer to the question

536
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,559
so the example is one i'd be interested

537
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,280
in

538
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,960
data around the frequency of other cases

539
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,520
you know my experience the failure modes

540
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,600
we see

541
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,960
are either the authoritative is just

542
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,719
plain offline or

543
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,080
it's perhaps you know dropping packets

544
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,440
based on you know looking at the query

545
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
type that it doesn't like or something

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
like that so i'd be

547
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,840
yeah i'm curious about the applicability

548
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,280
of things other than

549
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,039
you know examples yeah well

550
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,280
yeah other than dns well i think is

551
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,480
um is of course one of one of one of the

552
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
failure modes

553
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
as long as your sd as long as the

554
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,720
reporting resolver receives a response

555
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,199
and of course the authoritative server

556
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,480
that sends the response has this

557
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,960
um agent domain

558
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
um in it then even even lame delegations

559
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,080
can be reported this way that this

560
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
server is now reporting

561
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
that it's this server is now reporting

562
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,880
that it's not responsible for this

563
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,679
domain even though it was delegated to

564
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,600
it

565
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,720
and so it basically it is

566
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,280
um only and i think only only in the

567
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,720
case

568
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,960
where um where an authoritative response

569
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,240
authoritative server doesn't respond at

570
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,520
all

571
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,039
and that's the that's the case when

572
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,280
a reporting resolver can't report

573
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
anything right because it doesn't get

574
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,399
this

575
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,559
reporting agent domain in in almost all

576
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,720
other cases it has something to report

577
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,600
there are a few things where there's a

578
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,840
discussion if

579
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,280
for instance with the land delegation um

580
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,199
which side is really broken is the

581
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
parent or the child um

582
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
i think i think that's something we can

583
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,158
we can figure out

584
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,159
or even configure eventually

585
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,200
so but we're very much in the early

586
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
stages of developing this and get some

587
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,279
experience with this

588
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,279
but thank you for the question

589
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
jim

590
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,600
um right this is a very neat draft i

591
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,840
like it a lot

592
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,639
um i've got one or two concerns about

593
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,279
this issue of

594
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
the reporting agents and what its role

595
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,919
is going to be

596
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,600
and maybe this is something needs to be

597
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,760
clarified

598
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,840
is the the role of this reporting agent

599
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,840
going to be like the protocol police

600
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,879
and you mentioned the drafts and in the

601
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
slides here

602
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,360
is to inform the domain over order or

603
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
operator about an error

604
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,479
or is the idea that the reporting agent

605
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,879
could actually be

606
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,520
gatherings of essentially dns telemetry

607
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,760
data

608
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,120
from these failed air conditions i would

609
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,080
imagine something like this for example

610
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,559
we've been very very

611
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,678
youthful if we had it in place around

612
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,080
about the time of the run

613
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,679
the last route zone key rolled over so i

614
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,960
wonder if there's an idea to maybe put

615
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,440
some more text on what the

616
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
expectations are about the role of this

617
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,360
reporting agent and if that's worth

618
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,679
considering for the future rest of the

619
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,360
draft

620
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,039
um thanks jim for the question yeah i

621
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,479
don't know that's that's that's a good

622
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,520
idea you can use it

623
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,919
of course for telemetry um let's say a

624
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,960
large

625
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,480
a large and resolver constellation

626
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
and if they don't want to send

627
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,360
immediately all reports to all

628
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,720
authoritative domain servers that it

629
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,240
sees as broken

630
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,159
it can actually collect all the data

631
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
first and then

632
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,240
and and then send it on and the idea is

633
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,159
not to be the protocol police at all the

634
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,400
idea is is basically to

635
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
just get things fixed when when it's

636
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,679
broken i mean any any

637
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,600
any any delay is time wasted so um

638
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,240
i remember when i when i was at nominees

639
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,959
and we had this broken um

640
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,679
one one one broken uh how do you call

641
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,520
that we

642
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,279
we issued a um we reinstated the

643
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,039
previous dns key

644
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,760
and um and um and that broke a whole lot

645
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,960
of things

646
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,799
and and we only found out using using

647
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,360
twitter at the time that we had a pro

648
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,879
that we had a problem so we um we could

649
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,479
have used this at the time if that makes

650
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
any sense even though we had all checks

651
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,000
and balances there

652
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,760
and we still missed this one error so

653
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
it's definitely to fix things not to be

654
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,679
the prodigal please

655
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
thanks jim for the question

656
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,440
okay ralph

657
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,440
and you're muted ralph

658
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,679
that's always hard hopefully it works

659
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,679
now

660
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:24,080
so in dns

661
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,159
in a resolver the name servers are

662
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,520
usually identified by ip address so

663
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,240
you get and from your draft you get

664
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,879
a reporting agent per ip address say

665
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,200
yeah

666
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:40,159
but nobody prevents you to

667
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,159
kind of you use the domain to create a

668
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,279
domain that points to that

669
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,120
name server and is deliberately false or

670
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,240
is deliberately broken

671
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,000
so is that a way where we could seem

672
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,600
like the nx and s attack an attack

673
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
on the reporting agent using that

674
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,000
technique

675
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,080
or are there any kind of things in the

676
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,440
draft that i haven't

677
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,960
looked at that prevent that no there's

678
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
there's nothing that prevents that but

679
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,440
um i use the autodadium you can't stop

680
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,120
anyone from sending anything to anyone

681
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,000
on the internet anyway

682
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,879
so that's um of course you can set up to

683
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,360
break things

684
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,640
keep in mind that the reporting agent

685
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
the offer the server where all the

686
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,039
reports come in

687
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,720
that's actually just something where a

688
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,320
query comes in and a response comes back

689
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,399
and responses basically and acknowledge

690
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,279
that the query was sent

691
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,399
so there's there's it's just another

692
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,840
server

693
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,360
that will it's just not a server that

694
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,039
that will receive information and will

695
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,760
respond and is

696
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,760
is not going to be an amplifier um

697
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,399
so it should i mean i think what it

698
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,760
should be it should be handled

699
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:53,039
differently because

700
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,879
it can easily kind of gather

701
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,879
uh huge volumes of abuse

702
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,880
i i don't understand sorry well i mean

703
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,799
you should just

704
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,000
i mean uh if someone deliberately

705
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,799
makes a bad uh domain that that

706
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,840
generates lots of queries to the

707
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,639
reporting agent

708
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,559
then this could be abused so if you are

709
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,760
doing this for your domains

710
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,158
it would be good to maybe have a

711
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
suggestion giraffe that keep it separate

712
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,559
from

713
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,360
your regular authoritative name service

714
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,960
because it is easier abused

715
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,039
oh sorry yes that's actually in the

716
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,760
that's actually in the draft the um

717
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,840
the um the authoritative name server

718
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,960
that serves a domain

719
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,799
should not be um with

720
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,520
with the with the um agent edna zero

721
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,200
option right

722
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,200
should not be the same server as where

723
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,080
the reverse as where the error reports

724
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,559
come in

725
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,559
so that's definitely part of it and the

726
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,480
whole idea is that this that is

727
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
basically a completely separate entity

728
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,559
that can handle the errors and

729
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,320
figure out eventually using some some

730
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,000
kind of i don't know grab set arc you

731
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,799
know

732
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,640
who who's who's responsible where who's

733
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,520
responsible for what server etcetera you

734
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,520
you

735
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,360
you do that kind of stuff after the fact

736
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,360
right after you get the error reports in

737
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,320
i'll send you something about debut

738
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,919
scenario that you could maybe add

739
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,520
yeah thank you yep

740
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,840
bernie and then we'll we'll close the

741
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,840
mic line at this one thank go ahead

742
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
bernie

743
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,760
hello so having dealt with network

744
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,879
blocking in the last few years muslim

745
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,279
politically i was

746
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,120
wondering what kind of impact this has

747
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,880
to network blocking

748
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
and whether it all works with network

749
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,840
blocking and so on have you been

750
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
starting these also a bit

751
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
um yeah i think network blocking is

752
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,080
quite orthogonal to this issue you first

753
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,678
need to get a response anyway from

754
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,600
from from an authoritative server with

755
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,679
the edna zero option

756
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,879
that has the agent domain before you can

757
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,799
send a report

758
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,320
so after you've sent a report that

759
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,320
basically meant you

760
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,320
nothing got blocked if that makes any

761
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
sense

762
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,320
all right thank you all for your

763
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:24,960
questions and suzanne back to you

764
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,760
good thanks roy and

765
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,399
jim reed is next with the doh operator

766
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,559
draft

767
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,399
and jim i was assuming i would run the

768
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
slides just to reduce the switching

769
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,158
overhead but

770
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,439
no i think it's drive if you drive the

771
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,279
presentation suzanne

772
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,640
if you're moving parts and all that

773
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,360
that'd be great yeah

774
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:49,120
thank you um i really want to just

775
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,840
start off by setting the scene here

776
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,639
this idea is a revival of a document

777
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,480
that was submitted to itf 104 in prague

778
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,760
to the dual working group where it

779
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,679
generated a lot of

780
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,919
discussion not all of it was

781
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,880
particularly helpful in my view

782
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,240
um and we were left at that point we

783
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
being the authors of the document were

784
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,840
left

785
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
of quandary because at that stage the

786
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,279
dual working group was

787
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
being wound down there were talks about

788
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,640
potentially boss for a new working group

789
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,720
being set up so

790
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,399
we decided that that stasis of wait

791
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,399
until the dust settled into all that

792
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,199
kind of itf machinery had actually done

793
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,760
its thing

794
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,039
and we saw how things were progressing

795
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,080
but there was definitely

796
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,600
and still is a lot of enthusiasm for

797
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,840
documenting this stuff

798
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,719
and getting this eventually published

799
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,240
somehow

800
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,640
ideally as an itf document

801
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,440
um there are some gaps in the document

802
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,000
as there were

803
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,799
in the previous version and particularly

804
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,559
things like

805
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,879
tls session parameters and how these

806
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,039
might influence the behavior of

807
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,799
dual resolver services and that's

808
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,519
something that could still be worked on

809
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,039
if there's enough enthusiasm to progress

810
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,440
the document in some way

811
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,000
and of course the landscape has moved on

812
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,760
considerably since itf 104

813
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,039
there's a lot more experience and

814
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,760
insights into what

815
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,080
browsers in particular doing with their

816
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,960
do

817
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,960
settings and behavior next slide please

818
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,640
sort of step on elementary zone

819
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,440
there we go yeah yeah so as i said here

820
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,480
the objective here is purely to document

821
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,640
the problem space

822
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,640
for the deployment from the perspective

823
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,600
network operators primarily

824
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,360
but there may be some other

825
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,719
considerations here that could apply to

826
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,959
other use cases

827
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
i'm thinking say enterprise networks

828
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
that may have some

829
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
concerns around deployment with respect

830
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,080
to things like nat setups and split dns

831
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,320
setups and

832
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,918
stuff of that nature but the main thrust

833
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,918
of this is to do with

834
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,279
isps i've got the orders of millions of

835
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,200
customers or more

836
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,640
and inside those networks so i've got

837
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,000
all sorts of cpe

838
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
and all sorts of weird and wonderful

839
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,159
beasties like carter portals

840
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,000
carrier grade nat and of course whole

841
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,480
bunch of regularly considerations and

842
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
stuff

843
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,640
that applies to the operation of these

844
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,760
networks and of course

845
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,720
in these situations and all of an impact

846
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,879
on the asus infrastructure how things

847
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,320
are provisioned operating procedures

848
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
customer support and all these other

849
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,399
kind of stuff

850
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,399
and as i mentioned earlier i think it's

851
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,279
best if this gets documented in an its

852
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,719
setting

853
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,919
um and obviously an rsc is the end game

854
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,000
for this probably i think

855
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,120
an informational might be the best way

856
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,919
to get this thing

857
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,918
done and dusted next slide please

858
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,279
so the question is why does it why is

859
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,719
this

860
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,799
draft being submitted and why are we

861
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,840
having a discussion about it now

862
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,519
well this is about operator networks and

863
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,678
operational considerations

864
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,120
in some of these operator networks and

865
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,399
it involves dns

866
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,600
albeit primarily dns over http

867
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,840
rather than port 53. can't bring this

868
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,000
stuff to the working group that's gone

869
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,760
it's obviously a scope for deprive and

870
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,320
the ad working groups

871
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,960
so dns up seems to be the best place to

872
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,559
start

873
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,240
and it does have some overlap with it

874
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,079
there

875
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,678
in my view it doesn't have to become a

876
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,760
working group document

877
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,200
um it will need i think some degree of

878
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
oversight review by

879
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,439
dns experts who are some stage removed

880
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
from the office of the document and the

881
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,599
others are

882
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,560
interested in contributing to the

883
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,480
document so i think it potentially could

884
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,000
become an individual submission on any

885
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,639
sponsored document or something of that

886
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,760
nature

887
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,960
i'm fairly agnostic as to what the best

888
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,480
solution is here

889
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,918
and really i'm asking the working group

890
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,639
what they think might be the best next

891
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,399
steps

892
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,399
and that takes me to my final slide

893
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,000
which is where i shut up

894
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,679
and it gives time for everyone else to

895
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,239
give the comments and suggestions

896
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,520
through rotten fruit send money send

897
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,799
coffee

898
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,800
over to you thanks jim benjamin

899
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,680
uh i i i don't

900
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,599
uh i don't think this document is a good

901
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,799
fit for dns up i think it's

902
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:10,320
its contents are very broad and

903
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,760
a lot of it is considering regulatory

904
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,480
issues that are

905
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,359
and and speculating on legal questions

906
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,079
that are not

907
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,200
in scope for dns up and a lot of the

908
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,640
technical content

909
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,839
i don't think is really accurate

910
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:31,839
so i wouldn't want to use it as a

911
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:31,839
starting point

912
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,399
mark

913
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,520
yeah i'm much more enthusiastic than

914
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,640
benjamin i guess

915
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,079
um i i do think that this is an

916
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,839
important document

917
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,880
to have somewhere as documenting

918
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,160
operational experience and in my

919
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,000
my past bias is that documenting dns

920
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,160
operational experience is something that

921
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,079
is a good fit for dns op

922
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,440
but if the chairs don't feel that way

923
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,320
and if the working group doesn't feel

924
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,880
that way

925
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,359
and i i still think that documenting

926
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,480
this

927
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,000
needs to be pursued and so i would be

928
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,800
enthusiastic about seeing

929
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,320
this go forward my first preference

930
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,480
would be

931
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,240
to have it in dns op but if that's not

932
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,160
possible i'd still like to see it move

933
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,319
forward

934
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,240
under some other guys

935
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
okay thanks yeah and i have some

936
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,240
comments i'll make at the end um

937
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,280
but we'll we'll cut the line after

938
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,118
andrew but mr ferrell

939
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,160
hi uh i i i admire the bravery of taking

940
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,040
on all the things that were too

941
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,240
controversial for add

942
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,759
but it's i don't understand how you

943
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,959
could possibly finish this document

944
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,920
until add has done its work

945
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,119
so i'd be puzzled if this was something

946
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,119
that could be adopted right now

947
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,720
okay thanks ted

948
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,319
uh it's hard to speak uh i uh i'm sort

949
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,759
of expanding on stephen's comment in

950
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,640
that although i think that

951
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,079
it is it is both brave of jim and co to

952
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,720
to take this on and possibly very

953
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,079
important

954
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,720
that the landscape is changing pretty

955
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,119
fast not just an add in other places

956
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,839
and that this is probably not the time

957
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,560
to write down what we actually think the

958
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,799
dns uh

959
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,320
operations will look like i i think the

960
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,920
most that you could do at this time is

961
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,440
ask a whole bunch of questions which you

962
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,560
have in sort of like

963
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,079
uh six and seven and and other parts of

964
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,359
the draft that are more about you know

965
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,040
here are the considerations but we're

966
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,839
not telling you what the best practice

967
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,400
is yet

968
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,400
so i i think maybe keep those around and

969
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,119
as the best practices emerge write down

970
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,960
what those are

971
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,200
and then when you have that that would

972
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,160
be a great thing to document but i don't

973
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,759
think that this is

974
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,560
quite ready for publication

975
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,920
into an archival series at this point

976
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,240
because the

977
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,200
ground under its feet is moving almost

978
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,200
as fast as it is

979
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,839
thanks

980
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,000
oh andrew and you're muted andrew

981
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,640
yeah yeah thanks uh tim

982
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,359
um i think i i agree

983
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,040
with i think was mark who came in first

984
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,240
i i think the document does

985
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,599
serve a useful purpose um

986
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,640
i don't see the dependency on

987
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,480
the add working group work needing to

988
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,879
complete first

989
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,839
i think it's entirely valid to document

990
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,440
the uh

991
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,440
sort of considerations for operating

992
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,480
networks

993
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
the add working group

994
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
is just looking at uh resolver discovery

995
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,720
and selection

996
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,919
um so i think they can

997
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,480
quite reasonably uh run in parallel

998
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,119
um and if as ben suggested there are

999
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,400
some

1000
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,160
inaccuracies in the current draft then

1001
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,480
in my humble opinion those need to be

1002
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,598
fixed um

1003
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,640
and and again that's not a reason not to

1004
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,599
proceed uh with the document so i think

1005
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,759
it's a good document

1006
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,200
uh it's a good starting point let's work

1007
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,200
on it i'm happy to help with that

1008
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:21,680
okay ted you want to get back in there

1009
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,839
nope paul

1010
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,839
going back to um the original question

1011
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,200
of should it be done

1012
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,320
here as in dns off i would

1013
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,839
say probably not even though it's about

1014
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,119
operations it's not the kind of

1015
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,599
operations

1016
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,520
or or much of what's in this document

1017
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,520
and probably will end up in the end

1018
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,599
is not the kind of operations that this

1019
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,960
working group typically deals with

1020
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,440
such as regulatory and um

1021
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,320
interactions with with other parts of

1022
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,480
the system

1023
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,599
that are not technical interactions and

1024
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,599
such like that

1025
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,240
um it's certainly as it progresses

1026
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,040
should people like like it would make a

1027
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,078
lot of sense

1028
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,200
for the document authors to

1029
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,119
um tell dns off hey we've done a new

1030
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,240
draft or whatever but it should have its

1031
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,240
own mailing list

1032
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,399
and um i'll agree with some of the

1033
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,520
people earlier who said um it's

1034
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,160
premature

1035
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,640
that doesn't mean it's it like like ted

1036
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,118
said

1037
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,560
that doesn't mean we shouldn't start on

1038
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,520
looking at the questions

1039
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,480
but it's vastly premature to think that

1040
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,599
we're within

1041
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,640
months or even like you know

1042
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
seasons away from it being ready so

1043
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,078
i would propose it doesn't happen here

1044
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,359
um what but

1045
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,560
still that it should happen thank you

1046
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,680
okay thanks um so a few comments um when

1047
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,440
jim came to me

1048
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,279
came to us about this i sat down and

1049
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,040
read it and um

1050
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,200
i understood the operational point of

1051
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,359
views but as i pointed out to him the

1052
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,640
reports in there like the policy stuff

1053
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,880
which it just did just it's got you know

1054
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,960
there's just no place sort of thing and

1055
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
we just that will just be a minefield

1056
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,000
but there are things that should be

1057
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,760
documented and i think you know ted

1058
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,760
pointed out some of those as well

1059
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,400
um and it definitely needed to be

1060
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,839
reworked if we were gonna take it on

1061
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,240
which i wasn't sure i also suggested if

1062
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,040
it looks like it we don't take it on

1063
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,359
which you know

1064
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,160
working group um he can go independent

1065
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,680
stream but then

1066
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,839
it'll always kind of sort of pass

1067
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,399
through us to sort of get

1068
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,000
vetted at some level but i do agree that

1069
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
some of this needs to be sort of fleshed

1070
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,680
out i think

1071
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,240
what they're looking at is as you deploy

1072
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,160
dough

1073
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,720
what do you have to worry about right

1074
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,960
but correct the policy stuff

1075
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,879
and things of that nature that makes me

1076
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,000
really nervous from a

1077
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,680
sort of a chair point of view

1078
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,200
go ahead jim so my question

1079
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,879
being that the policy stuff makes me

1080
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,319
nervous too

1081
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,560
and i just want to make this clear to

1082
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,680
everybody there's absolutely no

1083
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,799
intention

1084
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,279
of any sort to try and get too involved

1085
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,680
in

1086
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,119
policy or regulated considerations or

1087
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,799
trying to fix those things

1088
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,160
these are clearly outside the remit of

1089
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,839
the ietf

1090
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,598
and the only point of having this kind

1091
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,240
of stuff text in

1092
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,680
a document list is just to say these are

1093
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,078
what the current policy

1094
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,118
or regulatory consensus considerations

1095
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,880
might be

1096
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,319
and essentially draw a line and say

1097
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,560
there be dragons

1098
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,079
we're not supposed to proposing in any

1099
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,720
sense to try and solve

1100
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,599
those policy considerations or

1101
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,520
recommendations

1102
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,640
or anything like that but just so that

1103
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,319
an operator will

1104
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,560
be aware of the fact that all you need

1105
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,759
to think about gdpr i mean it might be a

1106
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,279
statement of the audience but

1107
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,560
things of that nature these statements

1108
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,440
need to be written down and expressed

1109
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,720
somewhere

1110
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,960
that's really what we're trying to get

1111
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,118
at as part as part of this document

1112
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,839
it's certainly not asking the itf to

1113
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,839
work on things which are outside of

1114
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
school

1115
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,720
okay go ahead ben we have a few more

1116
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,720
minutes

1117
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,720
[Music]

1118
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,520
uh i'll just say i don't know um

1119
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,078
so i i take the point that the draft

1120
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,720
attempts

1121
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,480
to describe the existence of certain

1122
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,680
policy issues without

1123
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,359
getting too specific about uh what those

1124
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,680
exact issues are but i don't think that

1125
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,400
this

1126
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,279
is really our place and i don't think

1127
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,680
it's really

1128
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,560
useful that is if we don't have anything

1129
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,680
concrete

1130
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,799
or specific to say about

1131
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,200
policy and compliance then we're not

1132
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,280
doing

1133
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,919
anyone any favors by noting that policy

1134
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,319
issues

1135
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:53,200
exist especially because

1136
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,520
when we make mention of these policy

1137
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,520
issues whatever they might be

1138
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,880
we implicitly uh

1139
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,480
we engage a problem that that occurs

1140
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,160
frequently across the ietf

1141
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,280
where by documenting anything in an rfc

1142
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,799
it's very easy to accidentally lend it

1143
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,319
the

1144
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,960
impremature of the iedf and

1145
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,560
we should be very careful not to imply

1146
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,680
that certain policy choices

1147
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,240
are correct or incorrect or that

1148
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,160
the interpretation of those policies as

1149
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:36,160
binding particular parties

1150
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:39,759
are correct or incorrect

1151
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,040
andrew we'll let you wrap it up um

1152
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,359
and then we'll get on to the next

1153
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,200
presentation

1154
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,240
okay thanks um i was just going to uh

1155
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,520
just pick up on that last point

1156
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,560
uh from from ben i i think it's

1157
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,520
reasonable to

1158
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,759
note that the policy considerations can

1159
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,839
exist in certain areas

1160
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
not to make recommendations as to what

1161
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,440
stance

1162
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:09,760
to take on those

1163
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,920
considerations but i think it's entirely

1164
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,480
right to highlight that they exist

1165
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,520
and by the way most of the them as i

1166
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,960
read the document

1167
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,920
exist for all reserve resolver operators

1168
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,640
um whether they're network operators or

1169
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,400
not

1170
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,000
so it'll be useful to have them captured

1171
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,880
somewhere and this document's a good

1172
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,880
place to capture them

1173
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,839
thanks

1174
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,560
okay thank you thanks oh yeah go ahead

1175
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,319
suzanne yeah just to sort of

1176
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,759
i thought it would be good to get on the

1177
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,920
on the record the conversation that's

1178
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,599
been going on in the in the um

1179
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,440
the chat also that

1180
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,040
we do sort of at some point need to

1181
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,720
figure out if this is if if we're going

1182
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,079
to say this is not in scope

1183
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,319
for dinosaur and the the ise

1184
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,960
does include a conflict review um i have

1185
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,720
to say

1186
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,480
that to a first approximation i don't

1187
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,078
think that's a problem because the

1188
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,720
conflict review is about whether the

1189
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,079
work is

1190
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,959
the work in an independent submission

1191
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,000
draft is in conflict or contradiction to

1192
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:17,440
working group work um and what

1193
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,480
has happened before with conflict review

1194
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,000
situations

1195
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,000
is that if we say that

1196
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,440
the working group had a chance to

1197
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,560
discuss the draft had a chance to

1198
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,640
consider the issues

1199
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,560
and there there's no over there's no

1200
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,920
specific conflict with other work going

1201
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,599
on in the working group

1202
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,000
yeah that's not a problem and the point

1203
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,440
is not to presuppose the outcome of the

1204
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,599
discussion about

1205
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,839
the fate of this draft but only to say

1206
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,520
that we have a fair amount of

1207
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,560
flexibility as the working group

1208
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:48,319
to determine what work we take on and if

1209
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,480
people decide

1210
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,599
certainly it's it it's a good idea it's

1211
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,040
a good thing that the

1212
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,720
the draft exists and that there's the

1213
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,119
opportunity to comment on it

1214
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,040
but i do suggest people not get too hung

1215
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,160
up on

1216
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,839
the specifics of scope

1217
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,160
and charter when really the question is

1218
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:11,839
would this document and benefit and

1219
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,839
would the community benefit from

1220
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,760
a commitment from from the dns working

1221
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,000
group and what i'm hearing is that

1222
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:25,839
it's either to either no or it's too

1223
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,839
soon to tell

1224
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,440
i'm saying

1225
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,240
let's i think we should move on yeah

1226
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,000
i know people talking about doing a vote

1227
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,520
and i'm just terrible at the whole hands

1228
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,079
thing so suzanne unless you can figure

1229
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,000
that out

1230
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,920
then maybe we'll do that maybe we'll do

1231
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,640
that by the end of the day

1232
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,240
yeah not on the fly so right i yeah i've

1233
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,680
had trouble with that i agree with what

1234
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,439
folks are saying in the chat

1235
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:58,319
it's probably worth it what i would earn

1236
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,200
yeah what i would suggest is um both to

1237
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:01,119
the mailing list

1238
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,558
if um you know people want to consider

1239
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,880
continue the discussion also

1240
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,720
um drop a note to the authors

1241
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
um you know private discussion i'm sure

1242
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:13,919
that that feedback would also be welcome

1243
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,558
and there's a really interesting um

1244
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,839
discussion going on here so uh please do

1245
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,839
feel free to continue

1246
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,839
thank you

1247
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:35,839
and i guess we're on to the next

1248
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,839
so is fujiwara song here

1249
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,759
hello can you hear me yes

1250
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,480
this is called from jprs

1251
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:21,440
today i will talk about delegation

1252
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,440
information

1253
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,440
different sign up for dns set

1254
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:33,920
it is just an idea and

1255
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,920
it may have many programs extract b

1256
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:43,040
these are my motivations genetic

1257
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,960
specifications

1258
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,359
don't protect the appearance side nsl

1259
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,040
and will record in the delegation

1260
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:55,040
information

1261
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:57,440
it is a missing piece of dns why

1262
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,759
here inside any services and will record

1263
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,839
the non-authoritative data

1264
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,880
of parent zone parenthood cannot sign no

1265
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:09,279
authority data also additive servers can

1266
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,680
be moved a part of guru records chrome

1267
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,680
response packet

1268
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:19,520
records are not well or exactly defined

1269
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,720
however the referral parent site nsr and

1270
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,440
group records are

1271
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,558
important information specified by

1272
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,400
customers

1273
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:31,040
for tld and arroyos and roots

1274
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,160
currently here these are girls and roots

1275
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,359
sign

1276
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:40,799
theirs and instead because only

1277
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:46,000
next choice

1278
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,000
these are changes from 2005.

1279
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,000
there's the currency when there's a

1280
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,200
policy

1281
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,200
published the word

1282
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:00,078
in domain is defined by dns terminology

1283
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,759
the domain the into the in domain group

1284
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,559
is necessary and the substitutional

1285
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,760
information for

1286
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:09,119
name resolution and smart contrast

1287
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:12,559
draft eye distinction is not optional

1288
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,880
to oppose that guru records are

1289
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,760
expected to be returned as part of

1290
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,040
referrals

1291
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,480
before and if they cannot be fixed into

1292
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:25,200
the into the udp response teaching

1293
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,400
equal one must be set to inform the

1294
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,759
grant

1295
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,960
that the responses response is

1296
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,920
incomplete and that tcp should be used

1297
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,040
to retrieve

1298
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,880
the full exports and many areas software

1299
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,520
developers understand

1300
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,839
that referrals will record

1301
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,040
non-authoritative data

1302
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,599
many dns operators include still these

1303
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,960
arrows

1304
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:54,240
avoid coexistence of bearing zone and

1305
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,520
descendant zones on the same alternative

1306
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,640
server

1307
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,640
exercise reads

1308
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:08,319
this is one idea derivation information

1309
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,359
signer dis

1310
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:14,960
introduce its ds resource record

1311
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:20,119
assign a new digest and assign a new dns

1312
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:23,839
type xx delegation china with

1313
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:26,720
shj256 disseg-256

1314
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:29,680
the key tag and other skills may require

1315
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,640
in further discussion

1316
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:37,919
digest digestives calculated as

1317
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,040
shj256 hash of current parent site nsr

1318
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,079
set

1319
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,359
and in domain group records

1320
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:48,000
nslr set and intermingle records all or

1321
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,200
others canonical order defined by dns

1322
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,240
sec

1323
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:55,200
shivering shivering and automatic guru

1324
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,959
records are not the data to calculate

1325
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,000
the house

1326
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,800
and there are another idea because

1327
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,400
shivering guru is also written in the

1328
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,920
parent zone

1329
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,280
we can generate a giant with all invalid

1330
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:13,520
glue records

1331
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:17,280
and lead to define and parent zone

1332
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:20,960
signed dis resource record as dslr set

1333
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:23,760
this proposal includes dis data

1334
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,240
in the required responses dns validator

1335
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,839
can variate require responses

1336
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,839
extract fees

1337
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:38,000
this example shows dis ds resource

1338
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,000
record generation

1339
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:45,279
first remove all the is

1340
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:45,839
step one remove all the tis step two

1341
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,040
generate

1342
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,839
new dis two point one collect referral

1343
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,960
errors

1344
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:56,558
different nsr set and in domain group

1345
00:53:52,960 --> 00:54:00,559
in this example why irresponse from

1346
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:04,400
jpdns contains three nsl set

1347
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:08,839
and one ds resource record

1348
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,680
for in domain group

1349
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,119
then step 2.1

1350
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:16,399
step 2.1 correct a different nsr set on

1351
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,440
the internet blue

1352
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:22,480
and step 0.2

1353
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,559
the order nsr set and in domain group as

1354
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:31,040
dns canonical order

1355
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:35,440
step 2.3 calculate shj256 hash

1356
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:38,880
wide ajp ns 3ns resource record and

1357
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,880
nswide a

1358
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:53,200
00x6 and hash

1359
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:56,240
and next and step 3 sign the ideas

1360
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,480
signed dslr set contains generated dis

1361
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,839
and the original ds

1362
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:07,839
this is example of gis

1363
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,839
source record generation x-ray depends

1364
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,480
this is an example of the ice resource

1365
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,520
record validation

1366
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:19,280
when a validating reserve receives

1367
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:22,400
a referral response with dslr set and

1368
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,799
the ds error set contains a ds resource

1369
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,280
record that have

1370
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:31,040
disa 256 that style

1371
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,240
then calculate digest from nsr set and

1372
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,520
in domain group

1373
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:40,078
from response

1374
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:43,200
and and compare the digest

1375
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,119
compare the digest and the digestive

1376
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:50,078
field column the dis

1377
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:53,119
resource record and if the digestive

1378
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:56,720
the referral is compromised compromised

1379
00:55:53,119 --> 00:56:00,079
or modified the validating reserve

1380
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,078
can drop the difference

1381
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,559
next right please

1382
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,040
these are responses comments from the

1383
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:17,760
submarine list

1384
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,960
who signs dsdis is a part of the srl set

1385
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,160
it is signed by parent zone and it

1386
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:27,920
it is the same as the dsd arrow set

1387
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:31,279
fields and pd zone would become big

1388
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,720
because current ds registration ratio is

1389
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:40,240
very low and the ice adds ps

1390
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,240
and seconds and rs6 to all delegations

1391
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:46,720
it is not a problem for tlds with high

1392
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:51,040
with a high dns development race rate

1393
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,439
such as rotating and dns is really

1394
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,640
loosely coherent the ice doesn't work

1395
00:56:53,440 --> 00:57:00,079
when the source of data are not coherent

1396
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,879
many dns operators include pld's garages

1397
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:06,000
avoid poison co-existence of

1398
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:07,599
by apparent zone and

1399
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,119
descendant zones on the same

1400
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,920
authoritative server

1401
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:17,040
and in the manual in are well defined

1402
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,040
next slide please

1403
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,319
this is last slide i have a question

1404
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:29,280
why didn't we decide

1405
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:34,160
signing referrals different information

1406
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:38,400
they are inside nsnsrl set and group

1407
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,399
is it the missing piece of insect

1408
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,439
do you have interest about signing

1409
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,480
required information

1410
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,160
do you have another idea is it

1411
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:54,240
good to reuse ds resource record

1412
00:57:50,160 --> 00:58:09,839
is the delegation information idea good

1413
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:09,839
that's all please comment

1414
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:14,319
peter go ahead i know we have a few

1415
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,400
minutes so

1416
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,839
all right thanks uh thank you for

1417
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,760
writing this draft

1418
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:22,160
i effect proposed something quite like

1419
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,720
it in deep drive a few months ago

1420
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,160
people did not like it at the time but i

1421
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,520
feel that something like this

1422
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,598
might be the key to making uh

1423
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:35,920
authoritative dlt work with tlsa records

1424
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,680
so i understand that several people on

1425
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,000
deprive are watching this draft with

1426
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,520
great interest as well

1427
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,920
i have some practical comments but i

1428
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:50,160
think i can do those on lists

1429
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:52,480
so that's it thanks peter ben

1430
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,319
uh i think this draft is very

1431
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,559
interesting uh to peter's point

1432
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,599
it definitely overlaps with a bunch of

1433
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,079
things that are happening in deep

1434
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,480
private

1435
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,599
i would definitely move it from dns up

1436
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,119
to deprive

1437
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:05,359
you know i think to figure out if it

1438
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,640
makes sense we're going to first need

1439
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,839
to understand the bigger picture of off

1440
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,118
d.o.t

1441
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,119
to see if there's a place for it

1442
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:19,839
okay thanks

1443
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,119
oh jim

1444
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,040
um it's an interesting draft um

1445
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,559
i'm not so sure it's really needed

1446
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,680
because

1447
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,520
the child information in the child zone

1448
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:39,839
is signed

1449
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,599
so it's not clear to me that having some

1450
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,040
kind of signed metadata for the

1451
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,440
delegation

1452
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,400
in the parent over and above the ds

1453
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,079
record

1454
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:53,680
that's there is really needed and

1455
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,720
second point i have is would this dis

1456
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,319
record

1457
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,598
sit alongside a ds record or it would be

1458
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:03,279
is a plan to replace it my concern here

1459
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,359
is that we've already got a lot of

1460
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,119
complicated stuff around zone cuts and

1461
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:10,160
we'll end up less than the hard way

1462
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,119
with dns sec and i think adding more

1463
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,520
complexity here

1464
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,160
could make things even worse and it's

1465
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,640
not clear

1466
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,520
to me at least at the moment that we're

1467
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,960
actually

1468
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,040
going to get a big benefit from

1469
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,000
deploying this i think this needs a

1470
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,839
little bit more of a

1471
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,280
cost benefit calculation to be worked

1472
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,839
out thanks

1473
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,119
okay thanks um peter and olaf we've got

1474
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:32,480
a few more minutes before i think we

1475
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:32,480
drop so go ahead peter

1476
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:43,839
and you're muted

1477
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:57,839
you are still muted peter

1478
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:08,558
okay i'd say let's

1479
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,720
let's jump to olaf and then peter can

1480
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,680
figure out the mic thing um

1481
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,359
we'll go back to that how's that uh

1482
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,598
suzanne can you raise your thump if you

1483
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,319
hear me

1484
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,280
good um so on that first question why

1485
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,720
did we design

1486
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,599
uh sign referral information

1487
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,598
not to sign that

1488
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,920
i was you know the dns dsx chair at the

1489
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,040
time

1490
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,880
and i recall that we were very very

1491
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,040
careful

1492
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,240
to not muck about with what we

1493
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:42,880
understand

1494
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,759
of the dns at the time that we did this

1495
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,280
work

1496
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,319
and the introduction of ds uh record

1497
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,280
as an authoritative bit of information

1498
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,240
about the child was something that we

1499
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,880
that was

1500
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,879
a little bit over a jump into

1501
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,280
uncertainty it turned out to work

1502
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,039
um it turned out to not have all kinds

1503
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,480
of side effects but we were

1504
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:09,039
pretty afraid to do that so i

1505
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,000
i think that is sort of the context of

1506
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,480
not defining it

1507
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,119
was being careful at the time and making

1508
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,720
the most

1509
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:21,839
minimal changes to the dns while uh

1510
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:21,839
redesigning a dns sec

1511
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,200
over and out

1512
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:35,839
thanks olaf

1513
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,240
suzanne final comments

1514
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:46,319
um only that we should we should be

1515
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,000
saying thank you very much to everyone

1516
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:50,160
who participated this the

1517
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,920
this week our both of our sessions have

1518
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,759
been

1519
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,200
