65
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,919
adapting to the online format and so

66
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,199
much work goes in behind the scenes in

67
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,639
order to

68
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,319

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
and so we really appreciate all of that

77
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,239
effort um in

78
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,880
this unusual year that we're having here

79
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
with the online meetings

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
next

81
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
so we'll start with a report from myself

82
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,840
and from the iesg

83
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
talk a little bit about the impact of

84
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,679
covet 19

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,360
on the ietf look at our typical

86
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
participant statistics

87
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
and talk a little bit about planning for

88
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,759
future meetings

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,560
and a small change that we're making

90
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,560
to the boss request process for ietf110

91
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,919
so i know that there's been a kind of

92
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
questions and interest about

93
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
the impact of the pandemic on the

94
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,639
productivity of the itf and

95
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
participation

96
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,319
in the ietf um within the ihd we've

97
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,120
generated a little bit of

98
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,720
quantitative data to try and get a

99
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
handle around this

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
so i'll share a little bit of that with

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,159
all of you

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
so one measure we thought about looking

103
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,960
at was them

104
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,359
the mailing list traffic

105
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,239
and this is for all of the public

106
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,199
mailing lists

107
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,759
that we run so what we're looking at

108
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
here

109
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,160
is the three month moving average of

110
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,440
a number of messages posted per month uh

111
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,800
and comparing 2019 to 2020 um

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,440
so and you can if you remember

113
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,400
this onset of the pandemic in most of

114
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,520
the world

115
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,880
was in the march time frame so

116
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,958
um comparing last year to this year

117
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,279
what we see is actually a slight uptick

118
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,079
in the in the mail volume

119
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,559
um hard to draw too many conclusions for

120
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,800
this

121
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,079
um i think if it had you know plummeted

122
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,880
dramatically that would tell us

123
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
something

124
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,720
um but overall in terms of mailing list

125
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,080
activity

126
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,720
we are matching or slightly above where

127
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,800
we were

128
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
last year the other thing that i would

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,880
say is that um

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,080
we are we've only gathered the data here

131
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
uh for

132
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,680
um you know this year and last year we

133
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
don't know what the typical variance is

134
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,000
from

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,680
year to year that's something that we

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,200
could try to put together to

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,319
understand this data a little bit better

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
but we haven't done that yet

139
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,720
next

140
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
so we also thought to look at the

141
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,279
internet

142
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,440
draft posting activity um

143
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:32,800
same constraints around this data here

144
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,000
if we compare last year and this year

145
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,680
we're looking quite similar and as

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,519
you can see there's also a there's

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
seasonal variation

148
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,360
and we aren't really through to the end

149
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,000
of the year here the data that we had

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,399
for

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,200
2020 um we only did until through

152
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,440
october

153
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
um given the dupe that it is now and we

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,800
usually have this

155
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000
you know spike uh before right at the

156
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,920
draft deadline

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
um so you can see that reflected in the

158
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,000
graph uh but

159
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
overall in terms of on drafts posted uh

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
we're looking

161
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,839
uh quite similar from last year to this

162
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,839
year

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,320
next we also looked at

164
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
zero zero drafts um so subset of the

165
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
previous

166
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,279
data looking on specifically at zero

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,760
zero drafts as

168
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,560
you know kind of a extremely rough proxy

169
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,480
of

170
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,479
new work coming into the ietf um

171
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
and again the caveat here is like we

172
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
don't know what the

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,760
what the more typical year-over-year

174
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,880
variance variances but if we compare

175
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,240
last year to this year

176
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,920
it does seem that for pockets of this

177
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,279
year were

178
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,360
a bit below where we were last year so

179
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:49,600
possibly reflecting some dampening of

180
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
generation of new zero zeros based on

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,480
the pandemic or

182
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,519
potentially other factors we can't we

183
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
can't really draw conclusions but

184
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,839
that's what we saw in terms of the

185
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
numbers for zero zeros

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
so that's kind of what the the

187
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,880
quantitative

188
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
data shows a little bit little tiny

189
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
window there

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,320
um but i think uh

191
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
kind of reflecting on the experience

192
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
this year that the numbers really don't

193
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,160
tell you the whole story

194
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
or even close um i think it's safe to

195
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,399
say it's been a very

196
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
hard year globally because of the

197
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,959
pandemic

198
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,760
and um you know it would be nice if the

199
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,599
simple things that we do to get our

200
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,319
laptops or wireless access points

201
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
working

202
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
like unplugging them and plugging them

203
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
back in um

204
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,200
is you know something that we could do

205
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,480
um to solve this this pandemic but of

206
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,160
course it isn't

207
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,320
um i think that uh

208
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,360
having not had um in-person meetings

209
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,880
this year

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,120
uh we all realized that the tremendous

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,480
value that we derive from occupying a

212
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,519
physical space together

213
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,160
um and then it's very hard to uh imitate

214
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,079
that

215
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,760
um without being in that physical space

216
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,279
together for those who um

217
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,880
who attend the meetings in person and so

218
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,200
as a result i think some of the you know

219
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,200
the ties that that bind us together have

220
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,800
um develop a little bit of slack or uh

221
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,120
maybe frayed a little bit

222
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,079
and i know for myself that um that's an

223
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
experience

224
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:25,279
not um specific to the itf but

225
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,959
is uh is kind of something that i'm

226
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
experiencing in general

227
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,638
um that you know not being able to see

228
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
peace people in person

229
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,519
um makes you feel more distant um you

230
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,120
know creates that distance between you

231
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,760
and and those um in their life

232
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
and so first i would just want to thank

233
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
everybody for

234
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,839
their continuing dedication to the ietf

235
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,480
um

236
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
and for really continuing to drive the

237
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,880
engine of internet um

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,319
evolution and innovation forward um i

239
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,880
think we are seeing

240
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,160
uh uh you know whether the numbers are

241
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,800
down a little bit or not

242
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,480
um uh we're seeing a lot of activity and

243
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,439
a lot of active participation in the

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
ietf still

245
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
um and so i'm i'm really thankful for

246
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,040
that and for

247
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
all the efforts that um people continue

248
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,399
to put in um

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
to uh serving the mission of the ietf uh

250
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,839
it's really

251
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,240
um it's really gratifying and i think

252
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,360
this week's meeting is just the latest

253
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,000
evidence of that and

254
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,120
secondly if you go to the next slide um

255
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,839
we in the isg are always

256
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,440
you know open to ideas for how we can

257
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,639
bridge this gap better

258
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,360
how we can make the experience of the

259
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
ietf

260
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
better whether we're meeting in person

261
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,480
or not for

262
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,319
some longer period of time so

263
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,160
please feel free to you know bring your

264
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
suggestions to the open mic today

265
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,160
or to email us there our email address

266
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,880
is on the slide

267
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,240
um one thing we've talked about in

268
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,720
within the ieh

269
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,839
is just the need to have more kind of

270
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
informal

271
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,519
one-to-one or small group catch-ups with

272
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,880
people in the community and that's

273
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,399
something that

274
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,160
i've really fallen down with myself just

275
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,440
you know based on not seeing people in

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,639
person and having

277
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
other constraints on on my time and i

278
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
think that's probably uh

279
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,199
true for lots of us and so that's

280
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,839
something that we've we've talked about

281
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,199
trying to

282
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,680
to step up um to to you know fill in the

283
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,240
gap

284
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,599
that we that we feel by not seeing each

285
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,040
other in person um but there are

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
certainly other things that we can do

287
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
and

288
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,639
i'm going to be really happy to hear

289
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,839
people's suggestions for that

290
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,839
so we are we are open to that

291
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
feedback next

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,199
so these are the uh participant

293
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,720
statistics for this

294
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,359
meeting um uh you know north of

295
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
1200 registrations which uh if we

296
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,720
compare to

297
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
108 which was the the meeting that we

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,839
had in july

299
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
uh it's kind of similar about uh

300
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,599
somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to

301
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
70 more registrations at this meeting

302
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,320
than we had at 108.

303
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,439
um we had 250 people apply for

304
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,639
um fee waivers uh similarly as a slight

305
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,240
uptick from

306
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,320
um from 108 and 284 hackathon

307
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,680
registrations um these are all just the

308
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,199
registration numbers these are not the

309
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
participation numbers because we won't

310
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,959
have those

311
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
until um after the meeting is over

312
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,880
based on people joining later in the

313
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,040
week

314
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,120
we do have for registered participants

315
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,160
our country breakdown there you can see

316
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,519
it's uh fairly similar to what it

317
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,839
uh you know a kind of typical in-person

318
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,079
meeting depending on the

319
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,360
geographic location of the meeting so

320
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,319
good spread

321
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,320
across the world there

322
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
next

323
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
so this uh has been announced on the

324
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,079
mailing list

325
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
some time back the itf announcement list

326
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,719
but just to make sure everybody uh is

327
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
aware

328
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,839
uh the next itf meeting which is

329
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,120
originally planned

330
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,440
to take place in prague in march will

331
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,800
be an online meeting as well um so its

332
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,519
110 will be

333
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,639
online and it's a little bit earlier in

334
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,480
the year than our

335
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,680
our typical march meeting and happening

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,680
in the second week of march

337
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,279
next

338
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:30,000
so we're continuing to try to refine um

339
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,399
the this online meeting experience and

340
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
uh

341
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,440
the the best way that we can do that is

342
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,319
by getting a lot of feedback from the

343
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,720
community

344
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,880
about um how they think things are going

345
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
and what can be done better

346
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,199
and there's several different ways that

347
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,440
um that feedback can be provided

348
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,639
if you're having uh technical issues

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,160
during the meeting

350
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,639
um then we have um both

351
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,680
a meet echo ticket queue you can send

352
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
email

353
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,199
to create a ticket about a particular

354
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
issue

355
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:04,079
or you can join mtd

356
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,678
on jabber and flag the issue and try to

357
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,159
get it resolved that way

358
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,600
for feature requests which is not like i

359
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,199
have a bug that's preventing me from

360
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,119
participating but rather

361
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
um you know here's something i'd like to

362
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,799
see the platform do in the future

363
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,639
you can send those to the tools to

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,559
discuss mailing list

365
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
and those are being tracked for

366
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,359
improvement between now and ietf110

367
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,000
there will also be a meeting survey that

368
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:30,959
goes out at the end of the week

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
and that is super valuable for for

370
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,240
planning future meetings

371
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,320
um you know we reach a really broad

372
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,640
audience that way so every every one of

373
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,600
you

374
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
who can um fill it out um that feedback

375
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,520
really helps us

376
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,240
and you should see a link to that on the

377
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,039
109

378
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,720
attendees list as well as the itup

379
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,400
announcement list

380
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,640
and then for longer term planning we

381
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
have the stay home meet online

382
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,480
meet only online working group the shmu

383
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,880
working group

384
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,640
which we'll be meeting this friday at

385
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,799
five o'clock utc

386
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,799
and the mailing list is the many couches

387
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,320
mailing list um

388
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,840
at the meeting later this week there's

389
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,918
going to be a

390
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,120
discussion about many different aspects

391
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
of meeting planning

392
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,039
from fees ideas about having

393
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,120
asynchronous meetings

394
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,080
the cadence and length of online

395
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,559
meetings

396
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,320
how we do remote hackathons

397
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,840
considerations for when to cancel

398
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,678
meetings

399
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,959
the design of the show of hands tool

400
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,240
that we're using

401
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,039
for the first time here at 109. so if

402
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,799
you have

403
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,080
any interest in any of those topics or

404
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,200
other topics

405
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,918
for longer term meeting planning

406
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,200
in a remote setting then please put that

407
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
on your calendar and

408
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,039
come talk to us at shmu

409
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,039
next

410
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,280
so for itf 110 we are going to do

411
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
another slight little change and

412
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,360
experimentation

413
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:03,280
um with uh the the buff

414
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,959
timeline and and process um so

415
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,039
typically we would have the buff

416
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,160
deadline

417
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,960
a little bit closer to the the meeting

418
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
itself

419
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
for itf 110 we're going to move that

420
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,479
buff deadline

421
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,280
back just a bit to give the isg

422
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,600
and the ide more time to work with

423
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,918
proponents to refine their proposals

424
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
before a final decision gets made about

425
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,440
whether boss will be scheduled

426
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,959
for ietf 110 and as i noted earlier the

427
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,480
meeting itself is a little bit earlier

428
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
in the year so we really wanted to flag

429
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,880
this for people

430
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,440
far in advance so that everyone is aware

431
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,440
of these deadlines so for the next round

432
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,000
the buff request deadline

433
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,640
will be january 12th and the process for

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
submitting a buff request is the same

435
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
sending email to isg

436
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,480
ietf.org and posting an entry in the

437
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,200
buff wiki and there's instructions

438
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,880
for what to put in that entry if you

439
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
visit the wiki page

440
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,400
um we'll do a preliminary assessment uh

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,960
the iesg and the iab will look at all

442
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,679
the proposals and have a chat about them

443
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,039
um kind of preliminarily uh shortly

444
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,480
after the deadline

445
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
and then we'll have a couple of weeks

446
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
period where um we can work together

447
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,440
with the buff proponents gather more

448
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
information

449
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,520
um try to do some refinements before

450
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,280
making the final assessment

451
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,840
um just before the buff approval

452
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,158
deadline at the end of january

453
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,918
so that's the plan for the next round

454
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,760
and we'll see hopefully this

455
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,080
makes the process go a little bit more

456
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,480
smoothly

457
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,480
next

458
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,400
so try to keep it brief here because

459
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,360
i know people don't like sitting sitting

460
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,520
through long long plenary

461
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,399
so there's lots more topics covered

462
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,360
online

463
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
um we processed one appeal and the last

464
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,678
cycle is actually right

465
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,480
um after the plenary at the last meeting

466
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
um and there's more reports from the iab

467
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
the llc board secretary

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,400
iana all of that is in the meeting

469
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,880
materials

470
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
section of the data tracker and we of

471
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,280
course post

472
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,439
regular updates about a variety of

473
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,520
topics to the ietf blog so i encourage

474
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,919
people to check that out

475
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,918
and next slide onto the ib

476
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,320
yeah hello everybody and my name is mia

477
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,399
corbin and i give you very quickly

478
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,158
an update of what the iab is doing i

479
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,320
only have a few slides so i won't take

480
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,840
too much time off your sparse virtual

481
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
time we can go on the next slide

482
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,080
one more i guess um

483
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,600
so there's a full report which you can

484
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,158
find in the proceedings

485
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,199
uh and i'm just noticing that i um

486
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,880
didn't add an

487
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,720
additional bullet point here also

488
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
mentioning very briefly that we got one

489
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
appeal this time

490
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,120
we processed as well in the iab so you

491
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,559
can look that up in the report

492
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,158
in this presentation i would just

493
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,600
highlight some other things that

494
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,640
happened recently might be interesting

495
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,280
for you

496
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
next slide

497
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,520
yesterday we hold um held the iab open

498
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
meeting

499
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,559
so that's the second time we're doing

500
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,360
this um so far

501
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,799
i think feedback was positive what we're

502
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
trying to do in the meeting is really to

503
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
talk about the technical and

504
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,039
architectural work

505
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,200
um the iab is doing so we give feedback

506
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,559
on or like we present what we did in

507
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,760
terms of drafts

508
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,158
workshop and programs you can find all

509
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
the

510
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,559
information proceedings and the

511
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,000
recordings online of course as always

512
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,840
if you have feedback about this concept

513
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,080
you can send it directly to the ieb or

514
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,918
you can join a publish discussion on the

515
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,559
architecture discuss list on that

516
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,559
next slide

517
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
also um something that might be

518
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,158
interesting and more information has

519
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
been presented in the iab open meeting

520
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,559
yesterday

521
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,678
was that we held just last week also um

522
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,320
conflicting with some other stuff in ib

523
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,640
workshop

524
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,439
the workshop contained um three sessions

525
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
of two hours

526
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
each on monday friday and one day

527
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
wednesday and friday

528
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,360
so i think the setup worked um quite

529
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,960
well um

530
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,959
this was the first time we had a virtual

531
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
workshop and there was also very good

532
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
discussion

533
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,679
um about you know effects that we have

534
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,440
observed during this pandemic and things

535
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
we need to learn or we need to document

536
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,559
or we need to work on

537
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
and all the recordings are online as

538
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,240

a parallel organization to the ietf

563
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
which does research rather than

564
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,879
engineering

565
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,279
we're organized as a set of research

566
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,240

to try and recognize interesting new

591
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,159

681
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,240

686
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
of the feedback

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,039
we receive and we're reading it

688
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,159
carefully

689
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,840
um and there's the website

690
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,440

691
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,840

692
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,840

693
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,600
definition of friday because i get to

694
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,840
push the button and i'm not pushing it

695
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,959
until saturday so if we move on

696
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,199
um i did want to uh

697
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,360
just you know give you all a heads up on

698
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,760
this is the remaining schedule

699
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
that we're intending to abide by it's

700
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,279
sort of a traditional schedule

701
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,720
um we really want to uh be free for the

702
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,840
holidays so we are

703
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,440
trying to get things done and uh

704
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:13,918
we're totally on track and on schedule

705
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,399
um and so the last thing i really

706
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,120
wanted to provide you with uh well the

707
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,320
penultimate

708
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,158
is some statistics on the next page just

709
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
you know we love our statistics so i

710
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,840
thought i'd just uh provide you with a

711
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,320
bit of food for thought

712
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,840
um as to where the nominees are coming

713
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,158
from according to calendly

714
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
now admittedly calendly is basing it on

715
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,080
the ip address and some people were

716
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,559
coming in through corporate vpns

717
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,918
and so their corporate vpns uh if they

718
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,320
were working for a u.s

719
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,279
company may have represented them as u.s

720
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,720
even if they were

721
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:50,000
for example in india um

722
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,039
but nonetheless this is just something

723
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,279
to think of

724
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,480
uh you know as we look at who is

725
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,440
actually attending

726
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,240
ietf versus who is standing for the

727
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,799
positions

728
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,640
and maybe we need to do a little

729
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,720
something as a community

730
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,640
to try and have our leadership

731
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,399
even the people standing for leadership

732
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,200
positions more representative

733
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,799
of the community if we consider our

734
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,679
statistics representative of the

735
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,639
community

736
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,440
where you know even in a north american

737
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,519
meeting

738
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,720
only half of the people came from north

739
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,440
america

740
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,279
so i'm just going to have a little bit

741
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,200
of soapbox because y'all gave me this

742
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,559
platforms on the next slide is my

743
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,279
soapbox of

744
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,120
maybe we as a community can do just a

745
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,840
little bit more

746
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,120
to look around us especially those of us

747
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,439
who've been here a while

748
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,120
and who aren't aren't in leadership

749
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,880
positions because i don't think that

750
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,080
mentoring is something

751
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,919
that is the job of the

752
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,760
leadership necessarily i think it's the

753
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,159
job of the community especially

754
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,840
if we have a bottom-up driven

755
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,919
community model um so look around you

756
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,600
look at the people who are taking

757
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,600
minutes look at the people who are

758
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,519
writing drafts and say you know

759
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,799
i think maybe that person could make a

760
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,000
good working group chair

761
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,360
reach out to them say you know i think

762
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,159
you could make a good working group

763
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,360
chair

764
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,880
and you know maybe offer to chat with

765
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,959
them on a monthly basis

766
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,640
understand what roadblocks they're

767
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,760
facing in ietf what are

768
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,600
their hopes in ietf do they want to

769
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,158
maybe consider becoming a working group

770
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,439
chair

771
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,480
and see what we can do who've been

772
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,039
around for a while

773
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,039
to remove the barriers so that they can

774
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,879
get their rfcs published so they can

775
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,000
become working group chairs

776
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,279
and please let's together

777
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:53,840
as a community build a pipeline

778
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:53,840
thank you that's all i have

779
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,039
hello everyone

780
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,078
um next slide please

781
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,200
so and next slide thank you so i want to

782
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,879
start off by thanking cisco who have

783
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,480
been the host of this meeting

784
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,078
um it's often very difficult for um

785
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,800
when we have virtual meetings or online

786
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,040
meetings for hosts to get the same level

787
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,200
of benefits as they get in in person

788
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,079
meetings but our hosts have recognized

789
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,158
that

790
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,440
they need to support the itf and that

791
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,200
there are still ways in which we can

792
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
deliver benefits so it's very good

793
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
that they're continuing to support us so

794
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,599
thank you very much cisco

795
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,599
next slide please

796
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,799
and thank you to huawei our gold sponsor

797
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,960
for this meeting and thank you to fastly

798
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,639
who are our silver sponsor

799
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,800
you'll notify notice that it says

800
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,440
diversity inclusivity there

801
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
we are shifting the way that we offer

802
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,640
sponsorships

803
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,079
um away from just general meeting

804
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,920
sponsorships towards more

805
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,359
value-based sponsorships because we've

806
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,280
heard from our

807
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,680
sponsors that they that gives them

808
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,320
something more tangible to

809
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,480
sponsor and so this is um we're sort of

810
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,560
in a halfway stage at the moment so

811
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,880
thank you to fastly for picking up one

812
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,839
of our new value-based ones

813
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,839
next slide please

814
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,160
um thanks to our bronze sponsors

815
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,359
affiliates

816
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,920
and i can i can split in across two of

817
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:35,440
our categories running code one which is

818
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,760
covers the hackathon and um

819
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,800
the hackdown happy hour when we go back

820
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,760
to those

821
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,200

822
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,640
sponsorship as well

823
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
and thank you particularly to the fee

824
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,078
waiver sponsors cisco google and

825
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,439

826
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,720
this time

827
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,720

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,279
really know this that much but um cisco

831
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,400

equipment to us

835
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,640
the list price is mind-boggling and um

836
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,000
without that we simply couldn't

837
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,520
afford to run the meetings and there's a

838
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,040
way we currently do so thank you very

839
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,839
much for that

840
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,839

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,359
that and again we'd like to thank the

850
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,520
knock

851
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,480
and a brief apology that last time when

852
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,320
we thanked the knock

853
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,400
the affiliations weren't shown

854
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,560
which is important to knock members

855
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,680
given the amount of time that their

856
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,119
employers allow them to spend on the

857
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,160
knock activities and the amount that

858
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,680
they support them

859
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,160
so thank you very much to all the loc

860
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,040
members and their employers as well

861

um iatf110 as alyssa said is coming up

870
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,118
on the 8th to 12th of march 2021 a

871
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,599
little bit earlier in the month

872
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,640
we'll be announcing the ietf 110 host

873
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,960
soon when the

874
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,319
contracts are finally signed and we have

875
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,079
more contact

876
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,680
more sponsorship opportunities available

877
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,200
so please reach out if you're interested

878
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,000
in one of those

879
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,000
next slide please

880
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,759
and thank you to all of our global hosts

881
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,200
so that you know

882
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,960
our global hosts sign up for a contract

883
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,240
with us generally six to nine years they

884
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,280
pay us annually

885
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,118
as part of that and then they host um

886
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,119
a meeting generally once every three

887
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,760
years as part of that so their

888
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,040
support to us is where a significant

889
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,359
portion of money comes from

890
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,960
thank you very much to cisco comcast

891
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,078
ericsson huawei juniper

892
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,520
nbc universal and nokia thank you

893
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,440
next slide please so future meeting

894
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,440
locations and venues

895
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,440
this is looking a little bit sparse

896
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,880
we're not showing as much as we normally

897
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,040
do here because we've

898
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,320
um we're still in the process of

899
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,960
renegotiating the meeting meetings that

900
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,040
we've moved so renegotiating

901
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,240
moving bangkok to another slot and

902
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,160
moving

903
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
prague which would have been 110 to

904
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,960
another slot as well

905
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
and so those things are taking a bit of

906
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,119
time so for the moment we can show that

907
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,520
we have 110 next

908
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,359
online meeting then in july of next year

909
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,800
we have san francisco booked

910
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,040
where hopefully will be the first time

911
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,599
we'll all meet again in person

912
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,599
and then at the end of the year madrid

913
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,880
which is of course a rebooking from

914
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,119
the previous cancellation and then

915
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,240
one yet not not yet booked in asia but

916
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,200
you can guess what we're aiming to do

917
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,839
there i imagine

918
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,960
and then philadelphia for after that

919
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,960
thank you next slide please

920
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,240
so um my registration numbers don't

921
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,920
quite agree with elissa's we take them

922
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,439
at slightly different times but what you

923
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
can see here is the registration numbers

924
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,480
compared to budget

925
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,400
and as you can see we've done

926
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,839
better than budget if we take out the

927
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,599
fee waivers

928
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,040
we've done like 100 plus more than

929
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,400
budget so that's been very useful to us

930
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,079
and it shows that we're getting

931
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,520
reasonably good at understanding

932
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,760
how many people we think will attend

933
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,240
online meetings and having the right

934
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,760
capacity for those that meetings

935
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,279
next slide please

936
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
so i'm going to take a bit of time just

937
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,760
to um give you some final remarks now

938
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,400
i've been in the job um just over a year

939
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
now

940
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,480
um and it's been a particularly eventful

941
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,000
job um

942
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,040
i've met many of you um but kovid

943
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,200
uh has meant of course hindered that um

944
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,200
and i i think the effects of kovid have

945
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,200
actually been quite deep i'm not sure

946
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,759
we've all um really understood just how

947
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,240
deep they have i think we're all having

948
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,520
daily stress from lockdowns and seeing

949
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,279
people suffering

950
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,200
but we're also having a big impact from

951
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
a lack of in-person meetings

952
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,160
um one of the the in one of the

953
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,160
effects of that is i think we all get

954
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,920
quite focused and quite serious

955
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,759
because we don't give ourselves enough

956
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,000
time for human interactions

957
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,480
um and clearly the meetings don't have

958
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,920
the same energy as in-person meetings do

959
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,599
where we don't have the sort of side

960
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,720
chats we don't have the social side of

961
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,880
it and those things

962
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,399
and i think it's quite clear that

963
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,760
everyone's finding it increasingly hard

964
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,960
and we're all really looking forward to

965
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,800
meeting in person

966
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,920
and certainly that's what the um people

967
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,680
are telling me what the stats are

968
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,319
showing

969
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,680
um another big event and to be changed

970
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:56,720
this year has been the

971
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,440
ramping up of activity from the llc um

972
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,799
we have as you've seen initiated

973
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,280
multiple surveys to

974
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
provide evidence for decision making

975
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
there have been

976
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:08,400
multiple consultations or new policies

977
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,240
some of those have had some initial

978
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,480
missteps that have needed correction

979
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,359
but um generally that feel that's worked

980
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,839
well

981
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,839
um now much of this was to meet our

982
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,720
compliance obligations either to

983
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,359
isoc and or the law but we do understand

984
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,560
that this

985
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,078
sort of feels very corporate um but i

986
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,040
just want you all to be sure that this

987
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,040
is not a shift in focus to us this is um

988
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,119
as someone said to me the other day the

989
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,680
itf has built up a lot of management

990
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,599
debt

991
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,960
that needs to be repaid so this is just

992
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,760
a hump we're going through and then i

993
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,359
think things will then be back to

994
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,480
a less corporate cycle

995
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,240
now as i as sure you all know

996
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,800
recently after many years contributed

997
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,560
the iaetf henrik lefkovetz has chosen

998
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,240
not to renew his contract

999
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
and i know this has caused many of you

1000
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,879
concern so

1001
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,480
i want to assure you all that the llc is

1002
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,560
fully committed to treating everyone

1003
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,640
that contributes to the itf

1004
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,680
whatever their role with respect and as

1005
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,000
people not as um disposable resources

1006
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,359
it's a very clear focus of us i also

1007
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,359
want to assure you that we're not

1008
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,480
hiding disputes and tensions behind the

1009
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,319
scenes

1010
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,400
i was as surprised as anyone else by

1011
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,720
this development

1012
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,800
um now before i talk about how we aim to

1013
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,399
prevent such any upset in future i want

1014
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,760
to talk a little bit more broadly about

1015
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,640
volunteers

1016
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,800
um it's absolutely clear that a

1017
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,480
volunteer-driven ietf

1018
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,560
including the key operational areas of

1019
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,359
the tools and the knock is the best way

1020
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,440
forward

1021
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,880
um you know volunteers bring a real

1022
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,880
passion for the work

1023
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,040
there's a an unmatched breadth of ex

1024
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,599
breadth of expertise within

1025
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,359
the itf and volunteers bring an

1026
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,000
incredible diversity of solutions you

1027
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,319
know

1028
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,920
as we've seen so much of what the iitf

1029
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,240
has has been built by a volunteer who

1030
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,720
thought

1031
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,078
the itf needed it or could um that it

1032
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,720
fixed the problem

1033
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,920
and so i want to be quite clear the itf

1034
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,919
the llc

1035
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,599
does not want to replace volunteers with

1036
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,160
staff contractors and managed services

1037
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,280
that's

1038
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,440
not our plan at all um we also

1039
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,839
don't want to see an opaque migration of

1040
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,920
volunteers into contractors as you know

1041
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:17,279
as that happened a bit in the past

1042
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,680
um so with that in mind

1043
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,760
um with you know thinking about how we

1044
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,040
prevent another upset such as um has

1045
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,800
happened with henrik

1046
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,000
i i think you need to be sure that we're

1047
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,240
going to continue to follow the

1048
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,680
principles the community has set for us

1049
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,759
particularly the one about radical

1050
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,040
transparency so that we're all working

1051
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,400
off the same data so that we're

1052
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,319
publishing everything as much as

1053
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,839
possible there

1054
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,319
and with the help of some iab and iesg

1055
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,319
folks

1056
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,520
um we'll be seeing how other groups

1057
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,720
tackle the

1058
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,400
um similar issues of um how um

1059
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,919
contractors who are volunteers or the

1060
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,359
other way around or how how that whole

1061
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,079
area works together

1062
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,078
and how you ensure that things remain

1063
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,560
volunteer driven when you start to

1064
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,400
um you know bring contractors into the

1065
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,040
mix as well

1066
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,280
so look that's uh a lot to take in all

1067
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:07,759
at once delivered reasonably quickly

1068
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,960
um this has as i said been a very

1069
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,480
eventful year

1070
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,319
um and i'm sure there'll be questions

1071
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,240
about this later on yp

1072
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,079
um but i'm always happy for a one-to-one

1073

chat in personal by email if anyone

1074
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:23,839

um you've seen this slide many times now

1091
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,359
next slide

1092
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,319
and these are the times that we meet we

1093
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,599
publish months in advance our meeting

1094
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,759
schedule

1095
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,720
and i would encourage anyone interested

1096
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,920
to show up

1097
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,480
um we uh just as a minor note here we

1098
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,119
almost

1099
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,640
never have anyone from the community

1100
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,200
attend our board meetings

1101
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,400
we would love it if you did um we have a

1102
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,680
section where we take

1103
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,400
a q a at the end of the open sessions

1104
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,839
and we try to publish our agendas well

1105
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,839
in advance and

1106
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,520
you know we are adaptive to any new

1107
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,200
subjects that come up and

1108
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,880
and add them dynamically to the end of

1109
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,040
the agenda as well if needed

1110
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,160
so these are the upcoming meetings next

1111
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,040
one is on

1112
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,040
10th of december next slide please

1113
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,640
so um before i get into the recent board

1114
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,640
work completed

1115
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,680
i think it's important to go back and

1116
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,200
just level set

1117
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:37,078
you know what does the ietflc do

1118
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,480
and i always recommend referring back to

1119
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:41,599
rfc8711 and the responsibilities that

1120
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,480
are laid out there

1121
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,280
are really five things four of the key

1122
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,839
things and then one

1123
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,520
on the side the four key things are

1124
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,520
maintaining the operations

1125
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,440
uh meeting and non-meeting operations of

1126
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,319
the itf so basically keeping the lights

1127
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,319
on

1128
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,920
making sure that um you know events like

1129
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,839
this come off all right

1130
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
two managing the finances of the

1131
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,759
organization

1132
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,640
uh three fundraising on behalf of the

1133
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,200
organization

1134
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,078
and four compliance so compliance with

1135
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,960
uh

1136
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,200
you know relevant uh tax and other laws

1137
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,280
and regulations and so on

1138
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,359
and then the last um side thing which is

1139
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,000
not in that bulleted list

1140
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,400
of responsibilities is to address a lot

1141
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,400
of the

1142
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,200
design recommendations that arose during

1143
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,200
the asset 2 process and so

1144
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,000
there's another draft that's linked off

1145
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,078
from 8711 that bears reading as well

1146
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,559
and so we look at that for the areas

1147
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,160
that we are intended to focus on

1148
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:38,880
and so in terms of the recent work

1149
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,040
completed to tie that back

1150
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,720
probably the first here is our most

1151
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,359
important activity i've

1152
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,520
personally spent most of this year

1153
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,319
focused on this one issue

1154
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,040
because it's incredibly strategic and

1155
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,040
that is the

1156
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,880
continuation of the process of working

1157
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,920
with isoc to renew their financial

1158
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,359
commitment

1159
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,720
to the ietf and those of you

1160
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,960
may recall that when the llc was formed

1161
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,759
there was an initial agreement with isoc

1162
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,480
to provide

1163
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:11,280
two years of funding and that funding

1164
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,680
ends at the end of this calendar year

1165
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,680
and so without that financial lifeline

1166
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,558
we would obviously have a significant

1167
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,919
financial

1168
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,400
issue in operating the llc

1169
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,400
and they're for the ietf and so we've

1170
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,400
spent a great deal of time

1171
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,680
working through with isoc and their

1172
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,559
board

1173
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,799
how we should move forward together and

1174
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,359
we expect to have an announcement

1175
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,960
within the next couple of weeks so that

1176
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:39,839
is moving to a

1177
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,440
good conclusion i think um and i think

1178
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,759
you'll see when that comes out that it's

1179
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,240
a very very important one

1180
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,920
and uh like i said it'll be apparent the

1181
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,319
amount of time that we've invested in

1182
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
that

1183
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:54,880
and why secondly and this

1184
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,960
flows from the first one as we have been

1185
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,680
preparing to implement a fundraising and

1186
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,800
sponsorship

1187
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,720
strategy some of those sponsorship

1188
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,960
changes you've seen jay articulate or

1189
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,399
heard him articulate earlier

1190
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,559
focused on the diversity inclusion

1191
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,319
sponsorship for example there'll be some

1192
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,640
other funding and

1193
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,400
sort of sponsor opportunities announced

1194
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,598
in the future as well

1195
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,280
but um we are preparing to uh to

1196
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,200
bring on a resource to assist with

1197
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,119
fundraising and uh

1198
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,720
there'll be a lot more explanation in

1199
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:28,800
the next couple weeks to

1200
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,558
explain why and explain the opportunity

1201
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,480
that's in front of us and the need and

1202
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,640
so on

1203
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,559
and then third we wrapped up a statement

1204
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,520
on competition law it was really an

1205
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,079
update

1206
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,520
of prior guidance that we had provided

1207
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,880
but there were some questions from the

1208
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,000
community about that

1209
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,599
and so we provided a clarification but

1210
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,520
like i said there's been a significant

1211
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,079
amount focused on one and two

1212
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,079
and then of course obviously as you'll

1213
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,440
see i think on the next slide if you can

1214
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,880
move one ahead

1215
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:02,720
focused on the ongoing effects of

1216
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,520
the coronavirus so the inability to meet

1217
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,200
having to deal with cancellation of

1218
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,240
contracts or

1219
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:12,160
calling of clauses for rescheduling or

1220
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,879
working with insurance companies on

1221
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,720
claims

1222
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,319
and so on there's just been an enormous

1223
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,319
amount of

1224
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,000
administrative financial and legal work

1225
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,680
that has gone into all of that and

1226
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,599
planning ahead for

1227
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,879
when could we move meeting locations

1228
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,839
that we have

1229
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,640
um you know previously and i've had to

1230
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,160
cancel and

1231
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,680
when would that be moved to the future

1232
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,680
and so on as a result of that over the

1233
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,118
the summer time in the us and north

1234
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,879
america

1235
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,839
we we had a meeting and we discussed

1236
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,520
reforecasting the budget and in essence

1237
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,880
the challenge that we faced here was

1238
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,200
that we had a budget that

1239
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,880
supposed that we were meeting in person

1240
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,200
um three times

1241
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,079
and that um that is where our major

1242
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:57,439
costs and

1243
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,359
revenues were driven from but since we

1244
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,440
knew became clear that it wasn't going

1245
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,040
to be possible to meet in person

1246
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,119
we felt that every forecast of the

1247
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,720
budget to reflect that reality would

1248
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,880
uh would be appropriate and then that

1249
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,078
would help us manage a bit better

1250
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,720
i think the good news overall is that

1251
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,960
despite the difficulty in adapting to

1252
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,799
this situation

1253
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,640
and particularly as compared to many

1254
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,920
other organizations we have not

1255
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:26,879
had a significant

1256
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,920
you know material financial problem as

1257
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,400
an organization

1258
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,160
we have in the forecast budget you know

1259
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,160
some losses here

1260
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,558
we're pending some insurance claims

1261
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,480
related to the cancelled meetings

1262
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,760
and thank goodness that we had some of

1263
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,160
those

1264
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,839
insurances in the first place but the

1265
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,200
good news is that you know we are not

1266
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,240
facing a

1267
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,078
massive financial crisis as a result of

1268
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,240
our inability to meet in person

1269
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,119
and we've been able to very quickly

1270
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,439
pivot to online meetings

1271
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,559
and have some reduced fees as a result

1272
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,119
of them and

1273
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,960
and maintain sponsorships from a lot of

1274
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,880
generous sponsors that have been with us

1275
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,319
for years as well as new ones

1276
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,720
and so i think it's very important to

1277
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,400
reflect that um we've done

1278
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,799
well given all of this tremendous

1279
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,960
uncertainty and

1280
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,839
you know from a financial standpoint and

1281
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,200
uh that

1282
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,839
you know we are in a better position

1283
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,240
therefore hopefully as we emerge from

1284
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,400
that

1285
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:26,959
uh you know issue in 2021 at some point

1286
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,960
next slide

1287
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,920
uh here are all the ways to reach us

1288
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,200
these are also on our webpages nothing

1289
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,480
new here and feel free to reach out at

1290
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,000
any time

1291
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,960
as i said in terms of the meetings we

1292
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,079
encourage folks to join meetings and ask

1293
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,280
questions share feedback

1294
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,400
etc at the same time encourage people to

1295
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,280
send us email

1296
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,720
we almost never receive email from folks

1297
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
in the community

1298
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,720
with questions or feedback and we

1299
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,319
certainly request that and

1300
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,319
encourage it next line

1301
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:15,839
so that's it for now thank you very much

1302
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:15,839
and we'll be back for q a

1303
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,800
so um we have a memorial segment

1304
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,599
uh we had uh very sadly uh since the

1305
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,599
last meeting the passing of jim shad

1306
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,440
a very long time contributor to our

1307
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,880
community um

1308
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,760
a friend to so many and uh

1309
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,319
and a real inspiration and i've asked

1310
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,400
russ housley to say a few words about

1311
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:59,920
jim for us thank you

1312
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,680
um so many of you

1313
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,359
know that uh jim passed on the 3rd of

1314
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:09,440
october

1315
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:12,960
i met jim in the mid 1990s

1316
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,839
at that time jim worked for microsoft

1317
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:19,680
and we met at a workshop that was

1318
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:23,119
organized by rsa data security

1319
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,240
on email security the workshop was to

1320
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,720
determine whether

1321
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,200
a single email protocol could meet the

1322
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:32,879
needs of commercial

1323
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:35,759
and government especially military

1324
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,559
users it turned out that a single

1325
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,920
protocol

1326
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:43,119
could work for both communities and

1327
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,240
as a result rsa data security gave

1328
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,359
change control

1329
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,160
of the s mime specification to the itf

1330
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,480
to make that happen

1331
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,480
i ended up chairing that working group

1332
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,599
and jim was very active

1333
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:02,480
in the working group and he implemented

1334
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:04,640
s mime in microsoft outlook

1335
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,000
it's my understanding 20 years later

1336
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,759
much of jim's code is

1337
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,559
still used in outlook today

1338
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,880
jim was passionate about the itf and he

1339
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,240
stayed involved

1340
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,240
even after he left microsoft

1341
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,759
he basically retired when he left

1342
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,959
microsoft

1343
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,000
but in addition to his passion

1344
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,359
uh with the itf he had a passion for

1345
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,599
wine

1346
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:36,799
and so jim started august sellers

1347
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,480
named for his father uh on the family

1348
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:41,680
farm

1349
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,960
and uh as a result

1350
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:49,200
jim was was very difficult to find

1351
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:52,880
when the grapes were in need of crush

1352
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,078
uh and thus the the point of the picture

1353
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,440
um but otherwise he remained very active

1354
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,440
in the iatf

1355
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:04,799
simply because he enjoyed it and

1356
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,359
uh so he he just did that

1357
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,240
and focused his time on his two passions

1358
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:12,558
the internet

1359
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:17,200

1360
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:19,359
was the author of uh 29 rfcs

1361

editor queue

1363
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,598

chaired the ace working group and the

1371
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:56,319

1376
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,920
tools that are now used by the rfc

1377
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:14,720

for handling the new xml format

1379
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:22,880
many times when a newcomer came to the

1380
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:25,440
ietf gym was a warm and welcoming

1381
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,440
presence

1382
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:34,880
he was very quick to share experiences

1383
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:38,480
and uh his about his journey

1384
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:42,319
and it made him a wonderful

1385
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:45,760
mentor to some of the the newcomers

1386
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:48,240
um whenever i worked with jim

1387
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
uh on a technical specification he was

1388
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,399
always very polite

1389
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,000
in highlighting my mistakes and it's not

1390
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,040
because he was trying to

1391
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,960
uh you know show that he was smarter

1392
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,839
than anyone else he just wanted

1393
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,880
to make sure that the specification was

1394
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:06,240
right

1395
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,880
and he was always very generous with his

1396
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,598
time

1397
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,880
and his knowledge i can remember a few

1398
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,839
examples where he was asked to review

1399
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:17,839
a document and how he did the review was

1400
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,720
he wrote an implementation and told the

1401
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:23,759
person

1402
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:26,040
where more uh

1403
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,040
detail was needed in order to ensure

1404
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,040
interoperability

1405
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,400
in july 2019 i was lucky enough that i

1406
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,760
got to visit

1407
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,520
the jim's winery in oregon

1408
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:44,319
and i got to see how proud of it he was

1409
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,880
and his goal was i just want to make

1410
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,079
wine

1411
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,319
that people want to drink and i think

1412
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,960
that that is so um

1413
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,599
similar to the we just want to make an

1414
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,680
internet

1415
00:58:53,599 --> 00:59:00,079
that people want to use so uh

1416
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:01,279
that's the kind of thing that jim did

1417
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,640
all the time

1418
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,680

introduce ourselves

1557
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,799

vulnerability disclosure policy um or

1581
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,839
looking to do that very

1582
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,759
soon i saw the comments on the list and

1583
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:26,158
i just think it's a really positive

1584
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,520
step forward for the ietf to formalize

1585
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:30,080
the policy and have something

1586
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:35,839
public and and it's really good to see

1587
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:35,839
so thank you

1588
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,559
uh thanks for the feedback as you know

1589
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:44,238
there's more work to do but this is our

1590
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,239
first step in getting something out

1591
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,839
there

1592
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:03,840
anyone else in the queue for the isg

1593
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,560

1594
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:17,840

1595
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,840
the iab i think is next

1596
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:31,280
um yeah maybe we also put the site on

1597
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:35,199
for a second again um

1598
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,199
well people are studying the video

1599
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:45,840
because that gives everybody a chance to

1600
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:45,839
also connect face to name um

1601
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:51,040
because we will not make a random

1602
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:54,239
introductions but we can have people

1603
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,239

1604
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:03,199

opens session

1630
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,040
it was really nice to see a little bit

1631
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:21,440
more about what was going on inside the

1632
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,880
iab

1633
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,559
thank you for that as well a lot of

1634
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:28,080
things that's great

1635
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,080
uh we have mark and q

1636
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,719
with that um i also want to thank you

1637
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,520
for iab open

1638
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:37,040
but i have a constructive suggestion and

1639
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,520
that is that perhaps

1640
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:42,000
an hour is not enough i found the

1641
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:44,960
question and answer session at the end

1642
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:46,800
really productive uh really useful and i

1643
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,520
also felt like it was cut short for a

1644
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,880
little bit

1645
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:53,440
so perhaps scheduling it uh in march

1646
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,880
or a little longer might be helpful

1647
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,480
thanks

1648
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,000
thank you i mean we had some technical

1649
01:12:56,480 --> 01:13:01,678
problems this time so it

1650
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:04,080
did cut everything short uh we were also

1651
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:05,120
trying to not take away too much time

1652
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,559
from um

1653
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,080
the working group of gender time

1654
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,840
an hour and a half might be slightly

1655
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,440
better yes i agree

1656
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,320
we were hard pressed for time to get all

1657
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,320
that in there

1658
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:20,560
yep

1659
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,800
so gauri is still in the queue i think

1660
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,800
that's probably not on purpose

1661
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:33,120
and with that i don't see anybody else

1662
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,600
in the queue i will wait three more

1663
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,199
seconds

1664
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,199
to give people a chance to join

1665
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:47,840
and with that we're done with the iab

1666
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,840
overnight thank you everybody

1667
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:23,600

bunch of art infrastructure

1680
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:07,360
in various ways reliant on it

1681
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,040
and it's kind of not really officially

1682
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,799
supported

1683
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,880
and i don't i just want to know what

1684
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,320
what is our plan to kind of

1685
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:19,840
uh rationalize what we're doing here and

1686
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,880
um figure out how we can

1687
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,080
uh have a single point of contact for

1688
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,080
issues

1689
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,080
that do affect us regularly

1690
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:38,639
this one up um

1691
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:42,080
so on the single point of contact

1692
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,000
for things um we are

1693
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,920
as you know there are currently multiple

1694
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,040
different ways that you can

1695
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,520
um send a ticket through to people

1696
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,440
um and that all goes into various

1697
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,880
different cues and then into an rt

1698
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:58,239
system in the back end

1699
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,679
um the secretariat and some people from

1700
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,718
the knock and the tools team have been

1701
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:04,320
looking at this

1702
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:07,120
and are um soon after 109 will be

1703
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:09,759
replacing that with a new support system

1704
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:10,559
and we'll be amalgamating all of the

1705
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,320
various different

1706
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,640
email addresses down to a single email

1707
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,639
address support ietf.org

1708
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,960
so that you can then see um have a

1709
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:23,960
simple reporting mechanism um as to

1710
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,640
um the tools that itf.org yes the

1711
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:29,600
tools.atf.org is

1712
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,239
while it's named as if it is an official

1713
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,719
part of

1714
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:38,559
uh officially supported part of the ietf

1715
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:42,159
it is actually maintained and supported

1716
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:46,320
directly by henrik with some support

1717
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:48,320
from from the llc and the tools team

1718
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,920
and and if that's not quite right i'm

1719
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:53,120
sure henry will correct me

1720
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:55,199
um the uh there is a plan

1721
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,920
that um the tools team have for

1722
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:01,440
migrating various sets of services

1723
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,920
off that um and then

1724
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,120
when there are more things then that

1725
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,560
need to be discussed for us to

1726
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,199
understand where they go

1727
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,239
um while henrik is um stepping back from

1728
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:12,000
being a developer he

1729
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,678
very much intends to carry on with um

1730
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,800
tools and itf.org so

1731
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,679
we're not expecting a um any kind of

1732
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,960
problem there

1733
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:23,600
but it is understood that this is um

1734
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:25,840
you know what started as a as a space

1735
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:28,239
for people to experiment with tools

1736
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,360
has turned into an operational service

1737
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:33,040
for many people

1738
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:45,839
and some work needs to be done to

1739
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:45,840
sort of tidy that up a bit

1740
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,159
should we go to richard next in the

1741
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,159
queue

1742
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,880
hi good morning folks um thanks for uh

1753
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:21,759
financial relationship with isoc i think

1754
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,559
we've had some really good discussions

1755
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,960
lately

1756
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,880

job of that financial stewardship and

1761
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,000

uh for uh for isaac to understand and

1763

thank you i see we have david up next

1766
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,040
hi everyone good morning afternoon

1767
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,080
evening night

1768
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:59,360
can you hear me just right cool

1769
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:03,120
um i wanted to ask a question

1770
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:05,360
about bespoke tools i've noticed

1771
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,239
uh in itf we have a lot of tools that

1772
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,559
are very

1773
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:10,639
custom built and specific to what we do

1774
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:11,199
and and i understand the impulse like

1775
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,840
i've

1776
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:15,839
built a bunch of like not at itf but for

1777
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,880
in other things like custom tools myself

1778
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,560
and it's

1779
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,719
very tempting to kind of think that

1780
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,719
you're a special snowflake and nothing

1781
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:26,239
fits your needs just quite right so you

1782
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:29,679
need to build something custom

1783
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:32,559
but the problem is something custom will

1784
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:33,120
never reach the economies of scale that

1785
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,199
like

1786
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,960
a big provider of something else can do

1787
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,879
and i would kind of

1788
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,199
like to ask you the question of like are

1789
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:44,400
we making the right call here

1790
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:46,559
uh take tools.itf.org the

1791
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,719
main place that people use to read

1792
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,760
drafts and rfcs

1793
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,040
it takes seconds to load a draft which i

1794
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,159
still don't understand how that's

1795
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,960
possible

1796
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:58,320
uh or if you take meat echo compared to

1797
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,320
other vc solutions

1798
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,719
we had um so i was sharing with

1799
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:05,360
transport on monday we had a

1800
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,520
like 11 minute outage maybe open we had

1801
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,480
a five minute like

1802
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,280
they don't quite work as well as more

1803
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,799
commonplace

1804
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,280
things and i just wanted to ask the

1805
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,040
question of is this the right move

1806
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,040
like i think the medeco team has been

1807
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,440
working really hard and they have like

1808
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:22,800
good things but at the same time like

1809
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,239
i'm not sure this is necessarily the

1810
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,280
right direction that the atf should be

1811
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:27,280
going in at this point

1812
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,420
[Music]

1813
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,120
um so david i think that your

1814
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,800
your question is um conflating a number

1815
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,000
of things there so i'll try to pull them

1816
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,520
apart and

1817
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:52,320
tackle them first of all the the

1818
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,920
primary assertion in your statement that

1819
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:57,120
building bespoke tools

1820
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,840
is um more expensive or more complex

1821
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,080
than

1822
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,199
taking off the shelf tools is in my

1823
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:05,199
experience

1824
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:07,120
not a simple assertion by any means

1825
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:09,519
it depends on the complexity of your

1826
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,199
business processes the maturity of the

1827
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,679
industry and software that's available

1828
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:15,839
to you and various other things i've

1829
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,440
been a corporate i team manager for

1830
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,199
decades and implemented

1831
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,879
these things backwards left right center

1832
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,799
and it is not

1833
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,320
ever straightforward and simple you have

1834
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,560
to make that decision based on a whole

1835
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,920
set of complex circumstances

1836
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,480
the other thing that perhaps the most

1837
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,560
important thing though is that our tools

1838
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,239
largely are volunteer driven

1839
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:37,280
um so there is no point at which there

1840
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,519
is somebody

1841
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,400
in the llc sitting here saying no no we

1842
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,560
need to get rid of

1843
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,599
um data track and replace it with

1844
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,360
salesforce

1845
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,440
that's not the way that it's worked it's

1846
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,880
been uh the volunteers have

1847
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,440
driven the development of things and the

1848
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,400
way things go um

1849
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:56,960
secondly i think the one next um some of

1850
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,638
the things about um performance

1851
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,400
certainly i think there are definitely

1852
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:03,120
some um

1853
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,879
regular um complaints about that and

1854
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:07,519
that is something that

1855
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,880
we don't yet have the um the monitoring

1856
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,800
in place to be able to tell

1857
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,960
and their work is necessary to look at

1858
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,000
those so that's there's definitely

1859
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,840
an issue there the um um the tools team

1860
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,719
will know more about that

1861
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,840
and then finally about meet echo um i

1862
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,719
think it's important

1863
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,760
very very important to recognize that we

1864
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,480
have

1865
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,960
asked an enormous amount of meat echo

1866
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,919
and

1867
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,920
they have customized and developed their

1868
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,400
tool to meet our needs in a way that

1869
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,960
not no other organization who provides a

1870
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:41,920
standard tool like this would do

1871
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,840
we have also expected to have a tool

1872
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,719
that uses open standards as much as

1873
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,760
possible so it's webrtc-based and webrtc

1874
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,159
as we know isn't

1875
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,679
still a developing technology and

1876
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,480
particularly interaction with privacy

1877
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,960
and things

1878
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,919
we have an xmpp based um chat system

1879
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,080
built into which

1880
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,280
which nobody else in the planet probably

1881
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:03,440
would use anymore

1882
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:05,759
um and we also have um

1883
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,519
another thing oh about it which i'm

1884
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,080
forgetting struggling to remember but

1885
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,679
it's very much open service open um

1886
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,880
standards based which makes it quite

1887
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,520
unusual in that regard

1888
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:17,840
and we have asked for and had a

1889
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:20,800
significant amount of customizations

1890
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:22,320
and put in place for us um oh sorry the

1891
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,159
other thing is that we expect it to run

1892
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:27,280
on ipv6 and so

1893
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:29,120
um we are running it on um on different

1894
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:30,800
cloud platforms having moved cloud

1895
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,599
platforms ask them to move cloud

1896
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,080
platforms

1897
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,800
in order to improve the ipv6 capability

1898
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,880
of it

1899
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:40,960
so um in a context where we are making

1900
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,080
demanding so many changes and getting so

1901
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:44,480
many changes

1902
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:46,880
there is inevitably going to be some

1903
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:48,400
fluctuations in things

1904
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,920
it takes a while for these things to

1905
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,559
settle down and these things to put in

1906
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,280
place

1907
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:54,960
but we have to make the trade-off of

1908
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,599
whether we want something that is so

1909
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,320
well

1910
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,600
designed for our needs um or whether we

1911
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,000
want something that is

1912
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,199
entirely off the shelf and you know

1913
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,120
works differently

1914
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:06,719
and one what other just a final point

1915
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,920
here so you want to say something is

1916
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:09,679
that

1917
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,199
i think that we are judging some many

1918
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,960
people are judging meat echo by a

1919
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,320
different standard to the way they would

1920
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,520
judge something else

1921
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:19,280
that you know we would not expect the

1922
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,960
zoom or someone like that to make a

1923
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:22,960
customization for us

1924
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:24,880
we were not being up in arms in zoom if

1925
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,719
something were five pixels to the right

1926
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,239
or something was using a slight you know

1927
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,199
phrasing that wasn't quite right

1928
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,678
or we weren't happy about but because we

1929
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,519
have

1930
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,600
um worked with me taco so long because

1931
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:37,600
they make so many changes to things

1932
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,040
we have had quite no we have people

1933
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,719
expecting things from them

1934
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,560
that perhaps goes a bit beyond what

1935
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,719
that's possible so look so that's a

1936
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:46,480
broad answer to quite a complex question

1937
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,480
i think

1938
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,159
let me just um add to that thank you so

1939
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,159
much

1940
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:53,199
one sec if i could just add to that oh

1941
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:56,080
of course please do

1942
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:56,960
with other observations one would be we

1943
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:00,320
certainly heard

1944
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:02,639
in the process of discussing with isoc

1945
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,679
with the internet society about funding

1946
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:07,120
the concern

1947
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:10,320
over bespoke or legacy or you know

1948
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:12,239
non-performing tools come up as a

1949
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,920
regular concern it came up a number of

1950
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,919
times from

1951
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,040
their board and their community and so

1952
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,199
you know that was a part of that

1953
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:21,679
discussion

1954
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:24,159
and at the same time in a lot of the

1955
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:27,120
iasa 2 formation documents you can see

1956
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,559
in the design requirements document um a

1957
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,440
specific section about

1958
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:33,199
tools um and sort of technical platforms

1959
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:35,519
i think more generally

1960
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:37,040
and it talks about that the tension

1961
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,120
between the bespoke

1962
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,320
you know sort of created tools and and

1963
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,599
the more mainstream

1964
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,440
scalable uh or publicly supported ones

1965
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:47,679
and i think that that's a natural

1966
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:50,799
tension and as the organization

1967
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,679
itf matures it's natural for the

1968
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,159
community to

1969
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:56,719
ask those questions ultimately it's for

1970
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:58,559
the community to make those decisions

1971
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,000
and we are here to support and then

1972
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,760
execute whatever

1973
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,360
the direction the community wants to go

1974
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,120
in so if the community

1975
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,400
got together and decided we wanted to

1976
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:08,880
move from

1977
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:10,159
one particular technology to another you

1978
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,400
know we would be there to help

1979
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:13,519
um in the contracting and going out and

1980
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,839
finding you know

1981
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:17,120
bidders or whatever it may be but

1982
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,719
ultimately it's something that the

1983
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,480
community needs to come together and

1984
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:24,080
decide it's not something that we would

1985
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,080
you know decide and impose top 10

1986
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:31,839
so just to slightly answer those points

1987
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,120
if you'll give me 30 seconds

1988
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:36,080
um so on the standards front i totally

1989
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:38,800
agree you know

1990
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:40,480
as the itf we have to you know kind of

1991
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:44,480
eat our own dog food

1992
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:47,678
um that said uh

1993
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:48,718
you there is a wide pick of existing

1994
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,159
providers out there

1995
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,960
that support webrtc ipv6 many of that

1996
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:55,280
and

1997
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,040
i'm definitely not advocating oh go pick

1998
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,800
the one that's made by another part of

1999
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,400
my employer's company

2000
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,840
but there are many of them out there

2001
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:05,599
that do this and that do this

2002
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,880
well um then um so on the community

2003
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,560
point i totally agree i'm not

2004
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:11,520
saying well go do something i'm just

2005
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:12,880
asking the question and so maybe

2006
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:14,800
i guess that is what i'm asking let's

2007
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,880
ask the community and then just the

2008
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,800
final point i'll make is i totally agree

2009
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,080
of jay that it is a trade-off where on

2010
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,400
one hand

2011
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:24,239
um we have the bespoke tools where we

2012
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,839
can ask for specific features that's

2013
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,959
true like if you go to one of these big

2014
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,920
providers and ask

2015
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,040
for the something completely its with

2016
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:32,320
everything that no one else would ever

2017
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,199
want they're probably not going to build

2018
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:36,719
it

2019
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:40,719
um my personal take

2020
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:44,320
is that while these itf specific

2021
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:47,920
features are nice

2022
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:50,159
they're not as important as reliability

2023
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,080
in my personal experience and so like

2024
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:55,280
for example sharing a session

2025
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:58,559
um having the ability to have these

2026
01:27:55,280 --> 01:28:01,199
like the raise your hand tool was

2027
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,239
cute um and actually other providers

2028
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,799
have that it was the

2029
01:28:02,239 --> 01:28:05,360
like virtual hunting tool that was cute

2030
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,760
but

2031
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,400
i would personally much prefer to have a

2032
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,560
session

2033
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,679
an entire two-hour meeting where we can

2034
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,760
have a meeting

2035
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:14,880
as opposed to having to reconnect audio

2036
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,280
multiple times

2037
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:18,320
and having it drop off completely as

2038
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:21,280
there so

2039
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,120
it is completely a trade-off and both

2040
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,559
standpoints have complete merits

2041
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:26,400
but it might be worth it to open the

2042
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,080
question to your community to see

2043
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:30,000
what the which side of the trade-off

2044
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,159
might be best thanks so much for your

2045
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,159
time

2046
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:35,678
can i just add one thing i was

2047
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,159
struggling with mute button earlier

2048
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:40,239
um just that i think um on this point

2049
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:42,879
about the community discussion i think

2050
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:44,400
uh this works the best when there's like

2051
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,960
principal level guidance from the

2052
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,879
community

2053
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:49,440
i think having the you know the

2054
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:52,719
community like pick very specific tools

2055
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:54,400
is um doesn't really give us the ability

2056
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,199
to evolve at the pace

2057
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,879
at which we uh would want to in order to

2058
01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:01,120
meet people's expectations so

2059
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,639
i think like some framework that that

2060
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:03,519
gives the principal level guidance

2061
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,600
around this

2062
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,719
set of trade-offs would be quite useful

2063
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,880
and i encourage people to

2064
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,639
to bring that to shmoo for the remote

2065
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,960
participation piece um i guess that's

2066
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,840
totally within scope of the charter but

2067
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,360
um

2068
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,360
but you know trying to do this like tool

2069
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:21,040
by tool is uh

2070
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:24,320
it's just a rattle so that's my

2071
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:25,199
my plea for one people percent of you

2072
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:28,719
are here lisa

2073
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:31,599
thank you thanks i see next in the queue

2074
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:31,600
we have andrew

2075
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:38,320
hi um well two things firstly i

2076
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,599
just wanted to say to jay and i put this

2077
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:42,639
in the chat earlier

2078
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:46,000
thanks for covering some of the uh human

2079
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:49,120
uh aspects in your earlier comments um

2080
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,679
that was very welcome to see so thank

2081
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,920
you

2082
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,480
for that and then i was going to comment

2083
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:57,360
anyway as it happens on

2084
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,040
meat echo just really to complement the

2085
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,880
meat echo team and how they've evolved

2086
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:04,480
the tool

2087
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:09,120
since ietf 108

2088
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:11,839
and maybe to balance david's comments

2089
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,599
um from my recollection of atf 107

2090
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,560
although i didn't have any issues with

2091
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:19,120
webex a hell of a lot of people did

2092
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:20,320
um in the use of that continuously

2093
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:23,360
through the week

2094
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:25,199
um so uh i i think given the wide

2095
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,639
variety of platforms and devices and

2096
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:28,320
things that people use

2097
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,239
some people will inevitably have

2098
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:33,440
problems whatever

2099
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,239
um choice of conferencing platform to my

2100
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,719
experience

2101
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:38,159
meet echo is the best of the mainstream

2102
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:40,480
platforms that i've seen

2103
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:42,000
work really well at ripe a couple of

2104
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,320
weeks back as well

2105
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,040
um and as uh certainly the feature set

2106
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,559
has

2107
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:50,080
improved a fair bit since uh iatf 108 so

2108
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,320
i think they meet ecotema to be

2109
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,040
congratulated and they'd be ashamed to

2110
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,519
move to

2111
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,080
a different platform so um good choice

2112
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:59,280
uh

2113
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,280
in my mind thank you

2114
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,719
thank you andrew next up is colin

2115
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:10,159
so i i i think the answer was

2116
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,919
not really i think it was a little

2117
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,799
disingenuous and i think it comes back

2118
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,840
to things like

2119
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,679
is this volunteer driven or is this

2120
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:22,159
actually community driven or

2121
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:23,760
is this driven by j making a decision

2122
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,519
and i understand that's a complicated

2123
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,360
blend of all those things

2124
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,120
but statements like the data tracker was

2125
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,400
community driven is just simply not true

2126
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:32,320
i mean no it was a group wrote a

2127
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:33,839
contract and yes some volunteers wrote

2128
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,639
it and and whatever but it didn't work

2129
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,560
that way

2130
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,480
and around the selection of these tools

2131
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,360
as well um i

2132
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:41,919
do not feel as a community member that

2133
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:44,880
really

2134
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:46,800
um that is uh you know yes maybe we gave

2135
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,239
some broad input but i don't believe

2136
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:50,320
i believe this is decision this group's

2137
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:51,599
making uh i don't think it's making a

2138
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,440
good decision i think we should be

2139
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:55,920
measuring these tools by the ability to

2140
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,080
get the job done that we're here to do

2141
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,600
and we don't you know the voting tool

2142
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,880
could easily be separated out into

2143
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,719
something else

2144
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:05,199
every single one of the major conference

2145
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:07,040
inventors has apis and plugins to

2146
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:08,480
adopt them and modify their environments

2147
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,360
into different things but we don't use

2148
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:12,718
them

2149
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:16,000
uh the statements about xmpp webrtc

2150
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:17,360
ipv6 are categorically all wrong

2151
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,600
it reflects not really a deep

2152
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,679
understanding of what

2153
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,040
these services are or even having looked

2154
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,280
at them so

2155
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,480
i i think that we should revisit what

2156
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:28,080
we're trying to accomplish with these

2157
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,120
tools whether the tools met our needs

2158
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:31,360
well this week

2159
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,719
i every single meeting i've been in this

2160
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,360
week has had people

2161
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:37,280
not be able to contribute at some point

2162
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:40,880
due to meat echo problems

2163
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:42,559
uh it has reliability that is

2164
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:46,560
so low it's almost unmeasurable this

2165
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:48,000
week um yeah i talk about it

2166
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,080
i'm just barging in here because

2167
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,760
according to my view i see myself at the

2168
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:53,360
top of the queue above cullen i'm not

2169
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,440
sure if anyone else sees that but i also

2170
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,839
say tim oh that's hilarious

2171
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:59,519
to my point because i started up the

2172
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,120
chat window in a separate window and as

2173
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,880
i tried to scroll down and majorca

2174
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,320
crashed restarted itself

2175
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,560
i've now got a frozen copy of

2176
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,000
everybody's video plus a live copy of

2177
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:09,679
everybody's video and i've got myself

2178
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,080
at the top of the participant list above

2179
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:12,080
cullen

2180
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:16,400
what do you see everyone else is that

2181
01:33:15,199 --> 01:33:18,559
sorry i don't see

2182
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:19,440
that's funny i don't see brown i don't

2183
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:22,719
see you at

2184
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,480
all i see myself at the top of the list

2185
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,080
anyway i think i've said well yeah i'll

2186
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,959
block off on that and i will i will

2187
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,840
seat the floor to uh the other time

2188
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,800
broken and i

2189
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:34,400
i was supporting it a day ago but my

2190
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,639
experience of it in the day since

2191
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,480
is that it's been very unreliable and

2192
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:39,679
medico's responses on the mailing list

2193
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,280
have been very dismissive and

2194
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,760
victim-blaming about people who've been

2195
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,679
screwed over by its bugs

2196
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,880
they said we restarted the server and

2197
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,280
everything just worked fine

2198
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,280
and i posted them a screenshot showing

2199
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,719
that i had duplicate copies of the

2200
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:54,080
slides duplicate copies of everyone's

2201
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:55,040
videos and they said just refresh your

2202
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:57,280
browser

2203
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:58,320
that's not really a reliable solution to

2204
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,559
everything particularly

2205
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,480
given that i'm given a situation that

2206
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,639
says i'm at the top of the list that i'm

2207
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:06,799
in the queue but according to everyone

2208
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:08,960
else i'm not in the queue

2209
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,239
so the fact that i have an unreliable

2210
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:11,920
view of the world

2211
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,159
is a real problem i'm going to refresh

2212
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,159
now

2213
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:20,320
thanks well as you're refreshing and it

2214
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:24,560
points out the possibility of

2215
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:27,920
uh maybe as we work on our 2021

2216
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,719
uh work plan uh pulling in some sort of

2217
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:30,960
a

2218
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,639
tools assessment with the community and

2219
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:34,000
figuring out this balance tree would you

2220
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:37,679
like to comment

2221
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,199
yeah so i while i understand that there

2222
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:42,239
are people who have

2223
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:45,199
some strong problems with this um

2224
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:47,599
i do not think that the llc can respond

2225
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:49,440
by simply changing the tool

2226
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,600
based on that i don't think it is within

2227
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:53,759
the llc's remit to do that

2228
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,719
there has to be a community process that

2229
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,400
tells us

2230
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,400
what are the things that you think are

2231
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:00,320
important what are the things that needs

2232
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,879
to be delivered by the tool

2233
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,559
um possibly even a community process to

2234
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,239
choose the tool or something

2235
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,239
and that is what needs to happen for us

2236
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:08,799
to do that this is one of those things

2237
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,799
where

2238
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,320
we have a status quo i don't know the

2239
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:13,520
history of how we got here nor do i

2240
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,480
think the history is potentially

2241
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:17,520
relevant

2242
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,320
but we are in this place now and in

2243
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,880
order to move

2244
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:22,000
from this place we need a proper process

2245
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,440
to do that

2246
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,080
and i don't think unfortunately well

2247
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:30,559
i don't want to be rude about it but a

2248
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,920
level of complaint is not sufficient for

2249
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,360
us to be able to do that

2250
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,520
because it is such a um

2251
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:39,199
not quite arbitrary but it is a personal

2252
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,560
point of view that others disagree with

2253
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:43,839
strongly so we need to go through a

2254
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,840
rational process to get there

2255
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:48,239
so i'll just add on to what jay's saying

2256
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,719
you know clearly

2257
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:52,480
we have the ability to help facilitate

2258
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:53,520
that sort of process and there's also

2259
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,239
the schmoe

2260
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,760
working group so i suspect that we can

2261
01:35:56,239 --> 01:36:00,159
sort out ways to

2262
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:02,000
you know help have this conversation as

2263
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:04,320
we move into next year and

2264
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,320
we've certainly learned a lot more about

2265
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:08,320
our reliance on these tools as we've

2266
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:11,840
only been able to meet online

2267
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,840
so that's helpful

2268
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:25,840
yeah um so i actually think the

2269
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:25,840
history is

2270
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:16,559
and if you could ensure that you're

2271
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:20,320
muted and so on that would be good

2272
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:22,080
we're up to 124 sort of stopped at the

2273
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:23,679
moment

2274
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:25,360
is the chat room working for you guys

2275
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:28,159
because it's not working for me but

2276
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,159
everything else is

2277
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:35,759
i don't see any chat no i don't see 160

2278
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,759
people not 124.

2279
01:38:36,159 --> 01:38:40,239
yeah it's there's some server load

2280
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:42,320
because there's people

2281
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:43,759
reporting authentication errors being

2282
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:46,960
forced to log back in with meet up

2283
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,159
with data tracker so it might be

2284
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,600
correlated to the chat

2285
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:52,638
problems yep so we'll give it a moment

2286
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,560
to come back up just

2287
01:38:52,639 --> 01:38:57,840
as a side question um you know we're 36

2288
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:00,080
minutes after the hour

2289
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,679
this session won't cut off an end in

2290
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:04,080
four minutes will it

2291
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,080
continue

2292
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:12,480
no i think they're they're not

2293
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:14,480
configured to cut off anymore

2294
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:15,839
so uh we do see there are some people

2295
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,799
with their hands up in the queue and

2296
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,480
we'll get to you

2297
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,840
shortly we're going to just give it a

2298
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:24,000
few moments for other people to rejoin

2299
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,360
my uh counter of people that are in the

2300
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,280
session has

2301
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:30,239
ticked up a bit more to 146 at the

2302
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,519
moment

2303
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:41,839
i think other people are seeing

2304
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:41,840
different numbers we'll give it a moment

2305
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:12,400
so we'll give it maybe one or two more

2306
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:15,679
minutes um

2307
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:18,080
while we are waiting um you know braun

2308
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,760
i i see you're not in the queue anymore

2309
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,119
we've sort of restarted

2310
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,800
did you still want to be in the queue

2311
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:25,119
are you out of the queue

2312
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:26,639
where should we pop back on um i see him

2313
01:40:25,119 --> 01:40:28,320
on the the other video camera now

2314
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:32,560
because uh mateco didn't let me

2315
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:35,040
select the one i wanted that's okay um

2316
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:36,000
reliability is much more important than

2317
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:39,119
a lot of things

2318
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,440
and i think what we've found is that we

2319
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:43,280
have not had reliability at this meeting

2320
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,638
for pretty much any session i've been

2321
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,320
quite lucky in the ones

2322
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:47,600
i've hosted thankfully but i've attended

2323
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,639
a lot of sessions that have had a lot of

2324
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,960
problems

2325
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:52,000
i think that is a serious consideration

2326
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,760
it's

2327
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,080
a thousand people's time that's being

2328
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,639
wasted if something goes down and i

2329
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:58,400
think

2330
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,679
reliability needs to be a more important

2331
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:02,559
consideration

2332
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:04,719
than even using specific standards using

2333
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,520
specific standards is nice

2334
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:09,119
but working is really really important

2335
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:10,560
and i think we don't give that enough

2336
01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:14,320
consideration

2337
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:16,639
and i i think the customization is nice

2338
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,960
but reliability and consistency is

2339
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:21,199
significantly more important

2340
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:22,719
i found it was very difficult to report

2341
01:41:21,199 --> 01:41:24,719
usability issues

2342
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,480
in my experience with the medical test

2343
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:28,239
calls which i have attended as many as i

2344
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,400
could before hitf

2345
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:32,000
and have pointed out usability issues

2346
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:34,400
that cause people to have

2347
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,400
trouble as they come in and they haven't

2348
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,440
been dealt with

2349
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,559
there are a lot of things i like about

2350
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:41,280
medeco but the reliability of the tech

2351
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:43,600
stack is

2352
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:44,880
is really important for a conference of

2353
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,719
this size

2354
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,800
and i think we need to focus on that

2355
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:52,320
above for specific

2356
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,840
technologies and specific um

2357
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,320
features that that we think might be

2358
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,080
nice that was my main point actually

2359
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,440
what i was in the q4 was to talk about

2360
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,840
something completely different

2361
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,280
which is that i have had a couple of

2362
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,639
occasions where people have come to me

2363
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,599
saying i want to bring this work to the

2364
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,520
ietf

2365
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,920
can you explain how submitting a draft

2366
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:10,560
works and i have shown my mark based

2367
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:12,480
work

2368
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:14,480
workflow and they have found it very

2369
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:17,360
difficult to understand

2370
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:17,919
how to write a draft how to specify what

2371
01:42:17,360 --> 01:42:20,080
all the

2372
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,960
values and all the fields are that

2373
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,639
you're filling in

2374
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,800
in the header information in the

2375
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,800
tracking information

2376
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,800
dealing with what's xml and what's

2377
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:30,320
markdown and where do i find canonical

2378
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,000
documentation that tells me how to do

2379
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,679
this stuff and then how do i submit it

2380
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,639
and what's the workflow after i submit

2381
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:36,960
it

2382
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,239
i spent quite a while in gather town in

2383
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,960
a break between meetings today

2384
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:42,638
explaining it to a new person

2385
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,560
i'm not sure that i have a great idea

2386
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,000
either someone's audio is now fading

2387
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,400
back to me sorry if you could

2388
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:50,000
whoever else it is could mute that's

2389
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:53,440
quite frustrating

2390
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:55,360
um yeah so i think that that area of

2391
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:58,719
tools is quite difficult we have

2392
01:42:55,360 --> 01:43:01,440
a very large barrier of entry still in

2393
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:03,119
our document creation tool chain and i

2394
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,799
think that's a significant barrier to

2395
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:07,759
new people coming to the ietf to

2396
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:09,920
understand how to generate a document

2397
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:12,239
and we should be looking at that as much

2398
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:13,440
as this is an issue for for those of us

2399
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:13,919
who already kind of know what we're

2400
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:16,400
doing

2401
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,400
three times a year but the document

2402
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:21,360
generation toolchain is an issue

2403
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:22,719
all the time and that onboarding process

2404
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,320
is still pretty rough

2405
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:26,480
based on the experience that people have

2406
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:29,920
been coming to me as members of

2407
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,919
new members of my working groups

2408
01:43:30,159 --> 01:43:34,000
now thank you very much for that

2409
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:37,839
feedback i think we've heard the same

2410
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,800
obviously jay has a survey out about

2411
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,560
some of the

2412
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:43,440
tools and work processes and that's

2413
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:45,119
helpful we heard this as a point raised

2414
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:47,199
from the isoc board when we were going

2415
01:43:45,119 --> 01:43:49,199
through funding discussions

2416
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:51,759
particularly as as you noted in the

2417
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:54,559
context of new participants

2418
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:55,520
and it being a barrier to entry

2419
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,360
especially when

2420
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,440
someone might be making a decision

2421
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,480
between say participating in an open

2422
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:03,710
source community

2423
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:04,879
or some other standards organization and

2424
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:08,960
[Music]

2425
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:10,400
the barrier can be high so we understand

2426
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,920
yeah the final thing while i've got the

2427
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,839
microphone here to save coming back

2428
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,760
later that i wouldn't mind floating

2429
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:17,600
is that yes we've had a couple of people

2430
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,520
leave recently and it's difficult

2431
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:21,600
as a person who wasn't directly involved

2432
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,199
in it to know whether they left

2433
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,520
because they've been treated badly by

2434
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:26,638
the itf or because they're left because

2435
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:28,560
the itf is

2436
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,880
trying to build some accountability and

2437
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:33,760
structure around

2438
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,880
a world that was was very much everyone

2439
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,920
has their own fiefdom

2440
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,520
and runs it as they feel fit that's a

2441
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:42,000
tricky one to understand

2442
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,719
and certainly i i don't have a problem

2443
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,560
with

2444
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,719
building accountability and structures

2445
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:48,639
and things and i think it's really

2446
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:51,360
important that people feel included

2447
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:52,320
and feel involved i think it's also very

2448
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:54,000
important that we

2449
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:57,040
we continue to build processes that are

2450
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,199
good for the iatf and good for everybody

2451
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,840
and that will ruffle some feathers i'm

2452
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:04,000
sure

2453
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:04,719
thanks thank you ron uh next up in the

2454
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,040
queue i see

2455
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:07,040
eric

2456
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:12,639
so i i um bronze a number of things that

2457
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,360
i would

2458
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:16,400
oh and maybe i could have video um braun

2459
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:18,159
said a number of things

2460
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,679
that i agree with um so i have a few

2461
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,480
points i'd like to make um but i will do

2462
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,280
it briefly

2463
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,718
um first um i don't think that um any of

2464
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:25,840
the tools we currently have were in fact

2465
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,400
selected by the community they were

2466
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,880
selected in

2467
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,400
a bunch of ad hoc fashions um by you

2468
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,480
know uh leadership at the time

2469
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,920
um that's not necessarily bad um i think

2470
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,959
in fact that's the structure um

2471
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:36,239
that's some other structure we should

2472
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,520
have now which is the community gives

2473
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,718
guidance on what we're trying to achieve

2474
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,840
but the llc should be empowered to

2475
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,199
decide the kind of question of what

2476
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,960
tools we actually use

2477
01:45:41,199 --> 01:45:44,239
and so you know we should tell you what

2478
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,159
the priorities are and then you should

2479
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:47,199
decide which video conferencing tool or

2480
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:48,879
whatever we use

2481
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:50,559
um so i certainly don't think to ask the

2482
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:52,159
community should we use medico or meet

2483
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:54,080
or zoom or whatever

2484
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:55,440
contrary to ask us what our priorities

2485
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,000
are um so i think it's

2486
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,440
and i think that um and i i also don't

2487
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,880
think that we should we have to wait you

2488
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,000
know two years for a long community

2489
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,840
effort for you for you to consider

2490
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,639
reconsider the tool chain um you

2491
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:07,119
should be the best we have the

2492
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:10,239
circumstances um so

2493
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:11,599
um second um which isn't to advocate for

2494
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:14,480
any particular outcome

2495
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,760
um second um you know in terms of the

2496
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:17,519
hierarchy of needs here the most

2497
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,360
important thing is to get the job done

2498
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,119
and that means having things that work

2499
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:24,239
reliably um

2500
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:26,400
and um unpredictably and and

2501
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:27,360
customization is i think on top of that

2502
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:28,879
um you know people

2503
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,719
all across the world um do video

2504
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,560
conferencing or other things like this

2505
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,600
without any kind of customized tooling

2506
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:36,560
and so um you know so so so while

2507
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:38,000
hospitality is nice

2508
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,440
is not in fact the most important the

2509
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,280
most important thing is things work um

2510
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,638
third it's it's increasingly expensive

2511
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:45,679
to have bespoke tools

2512
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:47,520
and when you compare them to the

2513
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:47,920
commodity tools you get off the shelf um

2514
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,280
you know

2515
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:51,119
i work for an organization which like is

2516
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:52,559
a software development organization and

2517
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:53,839
yet we've increasingly moved towards

2518
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,520
having commodity tools because it's

2519
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,600
simply so expensive to maintain

2520
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,639
our own independent tool chains of

2521
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:00,239
things um

2522
01:46:58,639 --> 01:47:02,320
when compared to the tools that you get

2523
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:04,480
off the shelf that were relatively good

2524
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,880
um even though as i said we're not as

2525
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:09,678
well customized and built into our um

2526
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,960
our our uh structures and functions as

2527
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:14,320
one might have liked

2528
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,760
um uh next um

2529
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:17,199
why do you think it's important to be

2530
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:19,119
able to eat around dog food i think we

2531
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:22,879
have a tendency to go overboard here

2532
01:47:19,119 --> 01:47:24,719
um you know uh uh while it would be nice

2533
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,520
to have um you know every tool we use

2534
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:27,199
support ever

2535
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,159
every latest protocol that we designed i

2536
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,960
don't think that's the most important

2537
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,638
thing once again

2538
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:32,560
the most important thing is to use tools

2539
01:47:30,639 --> 01:47:35,520
to let us get the job done um

2540
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:37,199
with all that said um uh there are a

2541
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:38,320
number of webrtc based video

2542
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:40,239
conferencing tools

2543
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,840
so if descent which i'm i'm very

2544
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:43,280
attached to webrtc i spent a lot of time

2545
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,960
working on it and the center which one

2546
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:48,840
wants to use webrtc we do have a number

2547
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,480
of choices here it is not only one thank

2548
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:52,960
you

2549
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:54,400
thanks um ecker and i think i'm hearing

2550
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,480
um for you

2551
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,519
definitely themes of focusing on

2552
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,559
reliability

2553
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,639
and productivity and the tooling and

2554
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:03,679
um you know certainly we have heard in

2555
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,080
the past

2556
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:07,360
that maybe at the time that some aspects

2557
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:09,679
of the tool chain were

2558
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:11,839
created that there were no you know

2559
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:13,360
other alternatives or substitutes and so

2560
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:15,280
things had to be developed but

2561
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:17,119
that may not be the case any longer

2562
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:20,800
given your example

2563
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:24,320
um so thank you for that um next up

2564
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:24,320
uh tourless

2565
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,239
hi yeah so um with respect to meat echo

2566
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:31,519
and the tooling so i think

2567
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:34,080
um it's it's really been

2568
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:35,040
i think a great you know history of us

2569
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:37,600
you know

2570
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:39,519
doing our own eating our own dog food

2571
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:40,400
and developing our own tooling and i

2572
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,199
think the same

2573
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,480
should continue to be done for our you

2574
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:46,719
know um

2575
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,119
conference meeting experience right and

2576
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,400
so it would be bad to go to a model

2577
01:48:49,119 --> 01:48:53,599
where we're only

2578
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,000
um you know buying um services so i

2579
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:56,719
think

2580
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,760
uh it would be great to continue having

2581
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,760
a full team and

2582
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,119
ideally it should be independent of any

2583
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:03,199
you know given

2584
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:04,320
uh choices right so i'm not sure to what

2585
01:49:03,199 --> 01:49:06,400
extent the

2586
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:07,840
the meat echo team as an integration

2587
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:10,559
customization

2588
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,400
uh team would be able to do that but i

2589
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,760
think that would be my ideal

2590
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:17,920
preference to basically have best of

2591
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,239
both worlds right be open to

2592
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:21,920
uh integrate and use whatever the best

2593
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:24,159
starting tools are to not

2594
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,920
replicate work and but then also get the

2595
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,879
outcomes that we want with respect to

2596
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,159
our own

2597
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:31,840
customized experience the other point i

2598
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:34,080
wanted to quickly bring up and i hope

2599
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:37,520
this is the right place here

2600
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:39,599
um with respect to the timing of

2601
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,880
the meeting i think it's it was a

2602
01:49:39,599 --> 01:49:42,960
mistake to

2603
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,480
think that you know using a time local

2604
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,960
to a place we don't go to

2605
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:49,119
is a good thing if everybody is working

2606
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,440
in their own time zone and the majority

2607
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:52,639
of

2608
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:53,199
the um participants will likely be

2609
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:55,360
working

2610
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:56,480
between you know midnight and 6 a.m in

2611
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:59,839
the morning

2612
01:49:56,480 --> 01:50:00,239
um if we were to go on um longer with

2613
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:02,000
the

2614
01:50:00,239 --> 01:50:04,000
virtualized meetings i guess that would

2615
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,840
be easy to fix and avoid

2616
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,599
um the timing that we had this time i

2617
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,159
think it'll be a lot more difficult when

2618
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,560
we go

2619
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:12,719
over hopefully to a longer term that's

2620
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:15,920
going to be a lot more hybrid hopefully

2621
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:18,000
having a lot more people continuing to

2622
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,679
attend virtual instead of unnecessarily

2623
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,320
traveling but also having

2624
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,440
a traveling audience i think that's one

2625
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:26,559
of the big

2626
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:27,519
question marks that i'd like to see you

2627
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,920
know some

2628
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:31,119
thoughts being put to whether it's shmu

2629
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,639
or whatever the

2630
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:34,639
the right places are thanks

2631
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:39,839
thank you very much next up is benjamin

2632
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:46,159
hi uh ben gayduck here i had a

2633
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:47,759
question totally unrelated to mideko or

2634
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:50,719
tuling

2635
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,960
so my understanding is that mostly

2636
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:53,599
thanks to ray pelletier we had pandemic

2637
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:55,599
insurance

2638
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,040
up through the end of this year for our

2639
01:50:55,599 --> 01:50:58,960
in-person meetings

2640
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,159
uh but we could not get that you know

2641
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:03,199
going forward

2642
01:51:00,159 --> 01:51:04,320
so are we at all worried about any risks

2643
01:51:03,199 --> 01:51:05,519
that you know

2644
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,119
there might be something that happens

2645
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:09,760
and we end up significantly in the hole

2646
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,759
financially

2647
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:14,000
jay do you want to take this one

2648
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:21,839
okay you're muted there you go so it was

2649
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,960
um

2650
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:27,679
precisely for that real reason that we

2651
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,080
um made such an early decision to move

2652
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:31,760
um

2653
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:35,119
ietf 110 online um

2654
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:37,760
the uh for next year we have

2655
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:39,119
two meetings we have um the san

2656
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:43,040
francisco meeting

2657
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:44,080
and we have the um uh the madrid meeting

2658
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:46,639
afterwards

2659
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:48,480
we know with the madrid meeting that it

2660
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:50,159
is possible to move it because we moved

2661
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:52,480
it once already with them

2662
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:55,440
and they were good about that san

2663
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:58,879
francisco one is not so clear for us yet

2664
01:51:55,440 --> 01:52:02,239
so um the answer is

2665
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:04,800
there is a risk to us it is

2666
01:52:02,239 --> 01:52:06,400
problematic to quantify the level of the

2667
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,440
risk at the moment

2668
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:13,280
um the booking of

2669
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:16,320
san francisco significantly predates

2670
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:18,080
um these things but the pandemic

2671
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,960
insurance was only ever bought a year in

2672
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:21,360
advance and it's

2673
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,880
fantastic insurance very few people had

2674
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,920
it so i'm very pleased we had it

2675
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:28,159
but it doesn't apply to that one um

2676
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:29,360
so uh that's the best answer i can give

2677
01:52:28,159 --> 01:52:32,799
you the moment we

2678
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:34,159
it's if it if the risk eventuates then

2679
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,639
it is something we are going to have to

2680
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:39,119
manage carefully certainly

2681
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:40,880
all right thank you yeah and i'll add um

2682
01:52:39,119 --> 01:52:44,080
you know obviously we maintain an

2683
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:47,760
operating reserve to um you know help

2684
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:50,000
uh you know serve as a buffer on

2685
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,199
you know unexpected financial events and

2686
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:53,520
so

2687
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:55,360
you know these extraordinary sorts of

2688
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,840
you know circumstances certainly

2689
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:58,400
uh fall into that and i think actually

2690
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,280
the most

2691
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,759
challenging period for us will be when

2692
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,800
in

2693
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,920
hopefully 2021 the world begins to

2694
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,119
emerge from this

2695
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:11,199
and you know that first meeting you know

2696
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:13,519
may be the hardest or the most at risk

2697
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:13,919
because maybe we won't be sure of you

2698
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,320
know

2699
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,599
how many people can get there and can it

2700
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:19,840
be held and

2701
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:20,719
therefore there may be some risk of of

2702
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:23,599
you know financial

2703
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:25,679
loss there resulting from it we'll try

2704
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:27,440
to manage that as best we can

2705
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:30,080
but certainly at this point it's it's

2706
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:32,400
unclear you know when um

2707
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:33,519
you know the world will sort of go back

2708
01:53:32,400 --> 01:53:36,080
to some

2709
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,320
definition of normal and uh you know

2710
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:40,320
we'll do the best we can to manage

2711
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:42,480
and push out as far into the future as

2712
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:45,199
we can those decisions

2713
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,799
um but uh depending upon the venue in

2714
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:48,719
the hotel and so on

2715
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,080
uh some of those decisions may have to

2716
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:52,560
be made sooner

2717
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:54,239
than later but it varies by location but

2718
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,360
we'll see it's a lot of uncertainty

2719
01:53:54,239 --> 01:54:01,519
but uh everyone's facing it so thank you

2720
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:09,839
yeah thank you for taking it on yeah

2721
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:09,840
um next up we have uh

2722
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:17,760
okay so let me let me start

2723
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:21,840
with the observation that

2724
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:24,960
me that uh meet echo and probably

2725
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:29,679
none of the commercial off-the-shelf

2726
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:29,679
products would offer

2727
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,320
a way of giving hendrick the standing

2728
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:37,199
ovation

2729
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,840
that probably would have happened uh in

2730
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:41,839
a present

2731
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,840
meeting uh

2732
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,119
further further comments on this is from

2733
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:50,880
me

2734
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:54,159
is yes uh the experience of

2735
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,199
rely her unreliability of meat echo this

2736
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:59,280
time

2737
01:54:55,199 --> 01:55:03,119
uh has been really a bad surprise to me

2738
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:06,080
after a very good experience

2739
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:07,119
i think in the previous meeting

2740
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:10,559
including

2741
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:14,559
uh more observation of uh

2742
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:19,840
the meet echo team uh communicating

2743
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:19,840
with the ongoing conference

2744
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,599
i was expecting that to continue and i

2745
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:29,119
haven't

2746
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:29,119
i haven't seen that in a similar fashion

2747
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:36,719
the unreliability has been

2748
01:55:33,119 --> 01:55:39,920
specifically uh surprising to me

2749
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:43,360
after i observed at

2750
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:47,440
the recent ripe meeting that

2751
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:50,480
ripe decided to switch from a commercial

2752
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:53,759
off the shelf service uh

2753
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:57,440
to meet meet echo and

2754
01:55:53,760 --> 01:56:01,360
uh it worked really well except that

2755
01:55:57,440 --> 01:56:06,159
early on there was one

2756
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:09,920
failure and the

2757
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:13,040
causes were were easily were easily

2758
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:17,199
identified and fixed and

2759
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:21,760
um there was a lot of praise for

2760
01:56:17,199 --> 01:56:25,040
going to meet echo there uh

2761
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:28,239
a tiny additional observation there

2762
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:32,000
is that uh for

2763
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:35,839
questions about customization

2764
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,639
and plug plug-in possibilities in need

2765
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:39,440
echo

2766
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:40,880
actually the right meeting had a

2767
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:44,719
commercial off-the-shelf

2768
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:48,080
service plugged in instead of the

2769
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:50,960
humming tool or the hands up tool

2770
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:52,559
and well okay actually i did i didn't

2771
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:55,599
feel very nice about

2772
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:58,960
that service but kind of

2773
01:56:55,599 --> 01:57:02,560
that's all stuff that's there and

2774
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:05,920
for this community uh uh

2775
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:09,119
i'm kind of

2776
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:11,280
also a little bit irritated about the

2777
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:14,960
way we are discussing this

2778
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:17,840
because uh uh

2779
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:20,320
in a community like this i would

2780
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,520
actually expect that people are would be

2781
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:24,000
asking for

2782
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:26,159
well okay where do we get the report

2783
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,800
about what's happening and what what

2784
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:30,480
what has happened i observed that in

2785
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:34,239
this plenary session

2786
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:36,718
we did not have any slide as far as i

2787
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:39,759
recall

2788
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:44,000
giving information about the technical

2789
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:48,480
about the technical uh facilities

2790
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:50,840
and the usage that were applied to this

2791
01:57:48,480 --> 01:57:53,839
meeting

2792
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,840
thanks

2793
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:58,480
thank you very much and uh yeah

2794
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,799
certainly noted

2795
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:02,000
at the end usually these have been the

2796
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:07,840
knock report

2797
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,840
with the phone it was like wi-fi

2798
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:16,560
uh sorry can i just respond on the first

2799
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:21,119
point yeah

2800
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:22,960
um so uh i had suggested to henrik that

2801
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:24,000
we would recognize him at this plenary

2802
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,599
and he said he

2803
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,280
didn't want to do that he wanted to wait

2804
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,800
for an in-person meeting and so that's

2805
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:30,000
why we didn't do it at this meeting but

2806
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,080
um certainly he

2807
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,760
uh deserves a ton of recognition from

2808
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:35,679
the community and hopefully that can

2809
01:58:33,760 --> 01:58:37,280
take place at a later date so just

2810
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:38,800
wanted people to be aware of that it

2811
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:43,679
wasn't and oversight it was

2812
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:43,679
by design thanks tommy

2813
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:48,159
all right thank you um just i'll be

2814
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:50,080
brief but

2815
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:51,440
uh jay i wanted to respond to a comment

2816
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:52,719
that you made earlier about

2817
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:55,199
the fact that there are people who do

2818
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:56,960
feel strongly about tools like media in

2819
01:58:55,199 --> 01:59:00,400
both positive and negative ways

2820
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,159
um so while i think it is fine to have

2821
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:03,920
community feedback for these long-term

2822
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:05,759
decisions about tooling

2823
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:07,520
i disagree that it's a matter of opinion

2824
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:09,520
to weigh

2825
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:10,960
some people having good experiences with

2826
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,159
like the very factual problems that

2827
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:15,040
we've been having

2828
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:15,440
this week with meat echo and again like

2829
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:17,040
those

2830
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:18,960
opinions are good for long-term

2831
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:21,119
decisions but i would consider that

2832
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,480
the current situation where we're all

2833
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:24,159
we're forced to meet

2834
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:25,598
virtually like this is you know a very

2835
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:27,759
essential part of getting our work done

2836
01:59:25,599 --> 01:59:30,320
we don't have another option

2837
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:32,320
um it's kind of an emergency situation

2838
01:59:30,320 --> 01:59:33,840
where it's not acceptable to just say

2839
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:36,320
we're going to use the status quo if

2840
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:37,840
it's actually harming people's ability

2841
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:40,480
to participate and we've been seeing

2842
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:42,840
that every day this week and

2843
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:44,799
so i think yes let's start a long-term

2844
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:46,320
conversation whole community about

2845
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:47,199
tooling let's figure out how to make

2846
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,880
sure that

2847
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:50,559
mute echo and other tools like that are

2848
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:54,000
scaling well

2849
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,840
but we can have a temporary solution

2850
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:58,080
like what we did last march

2851
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,360
to say you know we just need just to put

2852
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:01,760
something in place to make sure that we

2853
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:04,159
have a backup system at least

2854
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,880
um to ensure that ietf110 will be

2855
02:00:04,159 --> 02:00:07,519
successful

2856
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:07,920
and like that should be our priority for

2857
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,599
now

2858
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:11,599
while we have these other discussions

2859
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:13,520
but let's make sure that people are not

2860
02:00:11,599 --> 02:00:16,080
going to be excluded or that our work is

2861
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:16,080
being harmed

2862
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:28,239
okay great thank you tommy

2863
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,239
next up we have rodney

2864
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:34,239
to uh torrelis is comment and speak up

2865
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,440
for for the people

2866
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:39,119
in the east asian and asia-pacific time

2867
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:41,280
zones

2868
02:00:39,119 --> 02:00:43,440
i'm in japan so it's 8 p.m now it's

2869
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,119
really nice to have the ietf meeting not

2870
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:47,360
be in the middle of the night

2871
02:00:45,119 --> 02:00:48,880
um we're going to be in a hybrid

2872
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,639
environment where

2873
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,280
a lot of the meetings actually take

2874
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:55,599
place year-round in a virtual fashion

2875
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:56,880
i think it's entirely reasonable to

2876
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:59,520
continue to hold it

2877
02:00:56,880 --> 02:01:01,280
in a fashion such that at least a

2878
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:02,080
reasonable fraction of the meetings are

2879
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,000
actually held

2880
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,920
in each of sort of the major regions of

2881
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
the planet um

2882
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:09,440
being in japan i'm sort of toward the

2883
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,760
eastern end of this

2884
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:14,239
bangkok is a couple of hours behind us

2885
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,320
and if you go two hours west from there

2886
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:18,718
you get to india two or two and a half

2887
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:20,639
so in this four and a half hour

2888
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:22,719
time zone slot here we have more than

2889
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:24,880
half of the world's population

2890
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:26,880
i realize it's substantially less than

2891
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,199
half of the total participation

2892
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:30,880
in ietf but if you don't have meetings

2893
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:32,320
that work for some of the people over

2894
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,920
here you're going to have

2895
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:36,960
trouble getting the actual participation

2896
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:39,360
you want from this half of the planet

2897
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:40,880
that's it by the way i actually really

2898
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:45,360
like meat echo

2899
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:50,000
thumbs up that's it

2900
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:54,320
thank you rodney next up we have henrik

2901
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:55,119
so uh as an illustration of a point that

2902
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,320
jade made

2903
02:01:55,119 --> 02:02:01,440
that these things are complex

2904
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:04,239
i wanted to mention that

2905
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:05,440
my understanding is that meat echo this

2906
02:02:04,239 --> 02:02:08,799
time is running

2907
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:12,400
on a different cloud fabric than

2908
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:13,840
uh earlier and what i've seen in the

2909
02:02:12,400 --> 02:02:17,280
tech support

2910
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:20,560
internal channel is that almost all the

2911
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:23,679
issues that ibats at least have observed

2912
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:26,080
have been related to the different

2913
02:02:23,679 --> 02:02:27,040
vendor of the virtual machines they're

2914
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:30,159
running on

2915
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:33,920
not with the me tech go uh

2916
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:37,598
software itself so it it's

2917
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:41,840
it's very easy to perceive a problem

2918
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:45,040
and point at the front end of it but

2919
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:47,360
the actual cause of the problem is

2920
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:50,400
sometimes much more complex i i don't

2921
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:52,880
think that really is news to any of us

2922
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,879
that's all

2923
02:02:57,440 --> 02:03:01,839
thank you

2924
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:15,679
i see an empty queue at the moment

2925
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:19,199
anyone else want to get into the queue

2926
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:19,199
i see uh richard in the queue

2927
02:03:20,400 --> 02:03:24,159
yeah i just wanted to really briefly

2928
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:26,880
re-emphasiz am i

2929
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:28,960
sending audio there we go um i just

2930
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:32,239
wanted to really briefly reemphasize

2931
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:32,960
a point that tommy made um that there is

2932
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:35,919
a real

2933
02:03:32,960 --> 02:03:37,599
asymmetry here between i was struck by

2934
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:40,639
the contrast between tommy's point

2935
02:03:37,599 --> 02:03:43,440
and rod's point um tommy's point being i

2936
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:45,360
can't participate because of something

2937
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:47,440
and rod's point being i like this and it

2938
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,839
strikes me like there's a real asymmetry

2939
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:49,440
there

2940
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:51,280
uh goes to this hierarchy of needs point

2941
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:53,199
that was earlier like

2942
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:54,719
yes like it's good to have tools that

2943
02:03:53,199 --> 02:03:56,079
people like and people find pleasant to

2944
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:58,560
use but it's much more

2945
02:03:56,079 --> 02:04:01,199
important if we believe in the openness

2946
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:03,599
and open participation points that we

2947
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:05,199
you know we espouse here to have tools

2948
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:06,880
that enable people to participate

2949
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:09,119
and provide reliability and

2950
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:11,840
accessibility um to the communities we

2951
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:11,839
want to participate here

2952
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:15,840
thank you richard and i'll just note i

2953
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:17,598
think um

2954
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,199
you know the board will have to have a

2955
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:21,679
think after

2956
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:23,440
this meeting in terms of some of our

2957
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:24,800
takeaways but it's clear that a theme

2958
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:27,598
throughout this has been

2959
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,840
uh pertaining to the reliability and

2960
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:31,920
need for productivity of the

2961
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:32,880
the tooling to support online meetings

2962
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:35,280
and so uh

2963
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:37,280
we'll need to circle back and and sort

2964
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:40,559
out a way that we can

2965
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:42,559
move forward with the community um john

2966
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,000
i see uh you're now up in the queue sean

2967
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:46,560
you're next

2968
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,840
yeah just two observations the first is

2969
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,840
that i want to uh

2970
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:56,880
um reinforce and support part of

2971
02:04:53,840 --> 02:05:00,639
henrik's point and

2972
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:03,760
uh and ask that the llc think about uh

2973
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:06,000
um managing some uh

2974
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:08,159
some systematic postmortems on the

2975
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:11,679
technology these meetings

2976
02:05:08,159 --> 02:05:13,839
uh so that we actually those of us who

2977
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,840
are interested actually understand

2978
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,960
what went wrong and what can be done to

2979
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:21,119
fix it

2980
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:24,960
uh for the next time rather than uh

2981
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:27,440
responding as almost everybody does in

2982
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,239
in the internet in similar situations by

2983
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:31,839
uh

2984
02:05:28,239 --> 02:05:32,559
uh blaming the uh uh the front end

2985
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,880
application

2986
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:36,400
or whatever it is you're looking at uh

2987
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:40,239
and since i have the floor

2988
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:44,480
i will add my own applause to the

2989
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:44,480
previous general effort thanks very much

2990
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:48,480
now thanks john and and i think an

2991
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:50,320
excellent uh point in terms of

2992
02:05:48,480 --> 02:05:51,598
a uh what i would call maybe a

2993
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:54,559
retrospective or

2994
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:56,639
after action report um i know in my uh

2995
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:58,320
devops teams we usually preferred not to

2996
02:05:56,639 --> 02:05:58,639
call it a postmortem because it implied

2997
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:02,079
that

2998
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:03,679
patient died and uh it was quite morbid

2999
02:06:02,079 --> 02:06:05,599
so i think we've got enough of that

3000
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:06,639
going on in the world today we'll focus

3001
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:08,719
on that and uh

3002
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:10,159
well interaction people but it's really

3003
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:13,199
well taken to

3004
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:16,000
to do a deep dive to understand you know

3005
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:17,839
how did how was each tool um or each

3006
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,079
system that we were relying on

3007
02:06:17,840 --> 02:06:21,040
performing what were the detailed issues

3008
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:22,719
you know have each

3009
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:24,960
each team basically do root cause

3010
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:27,280
analysis the same stuff we do in our

3011
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:28,480
everyday jobs anyway so i think that's

3012
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:31,280
really important to do

3013
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:33,040
and it can probably then inform any

3014
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:34,639
potential next steps that

3015
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:36,239
you know the community may want to take

3016
02:06:34,639 --> 02:06:38,320
i agreed and

3017
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:39,919
uh and agreed about your distinction of

3018
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:42,480
terminology although with the

3019
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:43,679
level of uh of outcry this week

3020
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:45,360
post-mortem might actually be

3021
02:06:43,679 --> 02:06:48,719
appropriate

3022
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:52,480
fair enough fair enough thank you touche

3023
02:06:48,719 --> 02:06:52,480
um spencer i see you're next

3024
02:06:52,960 --> 02:06:56,480
yeah i just wanted to thank the people

3025
02:06:55,440 --> 02:07:00,559
on the

3026
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:02,079
llc for uh their service because i note

3027
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:05,280
that

3028
02:07:02,079 --> 02:07:07,280
much of this discussion three years ago

3029
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:10,960
would have happened during the isg

3030
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:12,960
open mic and uh that's got to be a

3031
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,920
you know your service has got to be

3032
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:19,119
maybe more appreciated by the isg

3033
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:22,880
not being on stage for this than that as

3034
02:07:19,119 --> 02:07:25,199
anybody else and when you when

3035
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,639
you and john were talking about post

3036
02:07:25,199 --> 02:07:29,839
post-mortem so

3037
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:33,760
i think that our tools may still be

3038
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:36,960
perkier than uh some of the folks that

3039
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:38,960
are at this meeting because i know i

3040
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:41,920
feel dead

3041
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:41,920
have a great night

3042
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:48,320

3044
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,639
moment

3045
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:55,678
i know that i know previously i didn't

3046

3047
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:59,040

3048
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,760
queue so anyone else on the board here

3049

folks in the queue no

3051
