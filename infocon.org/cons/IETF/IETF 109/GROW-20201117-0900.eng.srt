1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,320
good morning everyone

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,640
the local time is 4pm

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,600
but he can hear me i can hear you did my

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:31,759
computer decide to be bad today

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:35,520
oh wait i know what the problem is

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
is it between the board and the chair

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
okay

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,320
all right so uh about a minute we can

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,038
probably get started

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
we have maybe

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,640
oh oh i can't

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,640
advance slides that's not great

13
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,000
hello yo i uploaded some chair slides

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,798
can you make the maybe i can

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,799
just try this again

16
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:30,400
okay all right they're working again

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
all right we have i think five for six

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
percent

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
six presenters something like that um it

20
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,600
would be great if the presenters could

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,199
first

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
uh before we get going too far along

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,479
decide whether or not they can actually

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,520
make their microphone and

25
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,000
presentation work we can i think i have

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,200
all the

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,920
presentations so we can run the

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:55,840
presentations for you

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,840
um if that's what you'd like to do but

30
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
would probably be good for the

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,119
presenters to kind of one by one go

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,479
through

33
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479

okay we are complete

53
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,199
okay all right so let's back up in the

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,719
slides

55
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
hello you're in bangkok it's uh or at

56
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
least bangkok time

57
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,599
it's uh the girl working group at itf

58
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
109 if you uh

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
are in the wrong room you probably

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,600
should change but this one could also be

61
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
fun

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
there's a note well i'm sure on the

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,800
second day you've read this before

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,560
if you haven't it's available on the

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,720
webpage don't read it now

66
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,800
the list of resources for our meeting

67
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
are the following the slides should all

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,479
be

69
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,320
updated on the meeting materials page

70
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,880
the chat in medico is really jabber

71
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,880
these days

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,000
and i think that's it for for those

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,360
uh we will need a oh i think blue sheets

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
are all virtual now they do it based on

75
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,759
attendance

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,759
in the room um

77
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,400
we're to need uh somebody to take some

78
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,400
minutes just to take the notes

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,840
i can take some notes okay so

80
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,080
do that and then the jabra scribe i

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,599
guess

82
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,758
i think john scutter said that we could

83
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
just use the existing chat thing to do

84
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
that

85
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
so that was in the last meeting i was in

86
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
with him

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
so we'll just do that

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,759
okay right there's not really any uh

89
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
rehash or agenda bashing if there's

90
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,240
things

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,759
we have a i think a two hour slot so if

92
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,759
there's things that we need to talk

93
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,520
about after these six presenters

94
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,960
after an hour we can certainly take time

95
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,000
to do that otherwise

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
we can all go back to bed or to the rest

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
of your day depending where you are in

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,679
the world

99
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
i think first up is michael and either

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
michael you can present your slides

101
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,840
yourself or i can present for you

102
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,160
and you can just say click it's up to

103
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,119
you

104
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
let me go ahead and try to

105
00:06:51,199 --> 00:07:05,120
okay present to my own

106
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,479
all right i think you don't want to do

107
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
the screen you want to just pick a

108
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,639
particular window if you can

109
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:17,599
or that how about this

110
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:20,039
perfect great thanks so um

111
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah this has been a a pretty

112
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:24,800
non-controversial draft it is a bcp and

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,039
i have to say it's been one of the

114
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
most pleasurable drafts that i've been a

115
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,759
part of writing because it's been

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,960
a lot of people have shown interest in

117
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,840
contributing to it uh it was quickly

118
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,719
adopted

119
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,520
and it's relatively straightforward

120
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,680
however there

121
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,359
we need to get it right because the idea

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,199
is to

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,960
provide some guidance to the community

124
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,800
a lot of authors on this i'm not sure if

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,599
anybody else is on this call but

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
uh we just wanted to just give an update

127
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
for those that are not familiar with

128
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
this work we wanted to make you familiar

129
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,440
with it and

130
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,878
get some of your feedback so the

131
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,319
background is back

132
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,000
in nanog79 doug midori presented

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
a some information on as path prepending

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,560
and the problems that have come

135
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,160
from it and

136
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,720
participants asked if there was any sort

137
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
of a bcp in ietf or any other sdo and

138
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,919
the answer was no

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,639
and so we decided that

140
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,960
it would be good idea to to do so the

141
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,159
itf should have a position on this and

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,279
this working group agreed and so

143
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,439
the problem is that excessive as

144
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,200
path pre-painting has caused routing

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,959
issues on the internet

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,560
it can cause routing issues on the

147
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,719
internet and so

148
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,479
our objective is to provide guidance to

149
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
the internet community with how best to

150
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,160
utilize

151
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
as path pre-pending in order to avoid

152
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,519
negatively affecting the internet

153
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,560
to offer offer alternatives um the

154
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160
challenge here

155
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,199
is to decide

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,360
in this draft if we want to encourage or

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,880
discourage as path prepending if we

158
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
discourage it

159
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,080
offer some alternatives um uh

160
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
people are using it so we need to be

161
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,600
careful not to

162
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,080
to negatively um attack it so it we need

163
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,160
to

164
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
just you know we have time obviously but

165
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,240
we just need to come up with

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,360
some good recommendations and i know

167
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,200
many of you have some opinions on this

168
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,080
we've received a lot of good feedback on

169
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,839
the list and we appreciate that

170
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,519
we've put you in as contributors we have

171
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
several one of those

172
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
is people thought generally that we

173
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
should

174
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,760
anonymize the real world

175
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
examples and so we've done that we've

176
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,480
used documentation prefixes and asses

177
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
some thought that we should just say it

178
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
how it is and just

179
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
call people out for uh what they've done

180
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
but um

181
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,880
generally the the feeling is that we

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,160
shouldn't and so we haven't

183
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,000
um although we do point two urls

184
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,199
including yours jeff

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
and doug's and

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
you can easily find some real world

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,000
examples that we

188
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,160
generically refer to there's a variety

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
of

190
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
use cases variety of reasons people use

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,880
afas path prepending some of those

192
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,439
are included here maybe we didn't

193
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,560
include all of them um

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,000
preferring one isp or another isp

195
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,279
one asbr over another asbr

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,519
utilizing one path exclusively

197
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,120
and another as a backup

198
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,040
signaling to indicate that one path may

199
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,040
have a different amount of capacity than

200
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,439
another

201
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,120
um and in some cases isps don't accept

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
traffic engineering using communities

203
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
and so

204
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,079
it's felt that prepending is the only

205
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,079
option

206
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,839
and so we've mentioned those in the

207
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:02,000
draft we mentioned

208
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,640
a few problems where

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
using s path prepending it negatively

210
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,040
impacts the internet including things

211
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,120
like

212
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,959
an attacker wanting to manipulate

213
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,000
traffic to a prefix and list

214
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,880
some shady data center to make that

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,600
same announcement with a shorter the

216
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,800
same prefix with a fabricated shorter as

217
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,480
path

218
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,120
and that malicious route would be

219
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:30,480
preferred if rpki wasn't being used

220
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,920
during a routing leak uh um you know

221
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,800
one in one country could

222
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,439
uh have routes that are elite and it

223
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,920
could be just

224
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,040
it was a mistake not maliciously and

225
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,199
those

226
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
are preferred because in other countries

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,160
prefixes are being announced with

228
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,800
excessively prepended paths

229
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,319
and so the illegitimate route would be

230
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,760
preferred over the legitimate route

231
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,360
and um it can also cause

232
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:05,200
problems um with platforms

233
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,440
memory usage by bgb speakers um

234
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,959
particularly where asps are included in

235
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,279
netflow messages

236
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,680
we do offer some alternatives to as path

237
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,320
prepend if that's the route that we

238
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,599
need to go and we probably need to or we

239
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,839
do need to make this

240
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,320
more robust and maybe offer some other

241
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,720
alternatives

242
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
using predefined communities that are

243
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
mapped to particular behavior

244
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,079
is one alternative or that's allowed and

245
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
where an isp

246
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,479
provides that support announce more

247
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,920
specific routes on the preferred path

248
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
if that's also supported you can also

249
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,920
use

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,880
origin codes when as pass or equivalent

251
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,399
length you can

252
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,880
advertise paths with an origin where you

253
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,839
can

254
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,839
have one path preferred over another

255
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,599
and this is probably the most important

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
i'm guessing part of the

257
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,240
the draft that we need to further

258
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,240
develop

259
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
and this is probably where maybe most of

260
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,120
the discussion will take place

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,560
but um we

262
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,079
in the draft what we currently say is

263
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,839
that network operators should ensure

264
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,638
pre-painting is absolutely necessary

265
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,639
because many networks have excessive

266
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,680
pre-pending um

267
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,120
we use some of doug's

268
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,120
uh information that he's done and um

269
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
to state that there's no need to prepare

270
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
more than five pre-pen more than five

271
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,959
asses

272
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,680
i think in jeff's uh paper on ap nick

273
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
also

274
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,239
i think they would also agree with that

275
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,760
um and we include a diagram that shows

276
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,000
that ninety percent of the aspas lanes

277
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,399
are five asns or fewer in length and

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,959
that's so that's why we say that

279
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
and some people you know do 20 30 or

280
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,719
more asp

281
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,760
path pre-pens um of course don't

282
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,800
pre-paint the s

283
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
ends that you don't own

284
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
pre-pending to all like if you have

285
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
multiple uh

286
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,079
providers and you're just preparing to

287
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,120
all of them maybe you've done that

288
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,199
because

289
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,199
you had you were perpending to one and

290
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,599
not to another but you discontinued one

291
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
link

292
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
and you just continued to prepend on the

293
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,360
one link that you still have active

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,279
it's really serves no no purpose that i

295
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,399
can see

296
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,160
and so that you should not be preparing

297
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,560
to all

298
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,560
and operators should consider limiting

299
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
the maximum as path lengths that are

300
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,518
being accepted

301
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,160
as well so that's kind of a quick

302
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,839
uh run through we again thank you for

303
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,120
all your comments

304
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,639
uh it's been good we at the very initial

305
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,880
stages of this we need to make sure that

306
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
we get this right

307
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,439
because we think that the itef should

308
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
have a clear

309
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
recommendation to the community and uh

310
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,839
if we have time for questions

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,839
let's uh take them

312
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
there's certainly some time for

313
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,160
questions

314
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
i start myself in the queue but as

315
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,199
there's been

316
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,680
no no thing i'll just start anyway i'm

317
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,599
jeff houston um

318
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,959
i'd actually like to see a bit more

319
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,480
practical advice

320
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,000
in this you talk about at some section

321
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
you know if you have to prepare and do

322
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,360
so carefully

323
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,959
but you know perhaps what she might also

324
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,639
know is a best practice is actually what

325
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,359
you should do

326
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,040
is actually enumerate what your routing

327
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,120
policies are intended to achieve

328
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,199
before you even go down the prepending

329
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,680
path in other words

330
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,758
the operator really should understand

331
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,439
what are you trying to get out of this

332
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
before you think prepending is a

333
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,519
solution

334
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,199
the other thing that you haven't noted

335
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,000
and i must have been in a formal life i

336
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,199
was guilty of

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,360
it is that sometimes the person you're

338
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,959
prepending at or the network

339
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,959
has simply got an unconditional

340
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,439
preference for customer routes

341
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,319
and prepending don't what doesn't work

342
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
so again

343
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,639
the sage advice is before you launch

344
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,800
into pre-pending

345
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,720
a note what you're trying to intend to

346
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
do and b

347
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,959
check with your neighbors that they're

348
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,720
even going to honor the pre-pend

349
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,079
because sometimes you're just wasting

350
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
your time and

351
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,680
creating vulnerabilities because

352
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,279
you know it your neighbor might not

353
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,319
actually use it as part of its routing

354
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800
preference

355
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
so i would add that in your section five

356
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,079
about best practices

357
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,479
you know write down what you're trying

358
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,920
to achieve and check with your bgp

359
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
neighbors that they actually do honor

360
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:05,839
prepending anyway

361
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:05,839
thanks very good point thank you

362
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,160
thank you for your document that we've

363
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,918
referenced it's been very helpful to us

364
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
so yeah if there's no more questions

365
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,880
chris then we're just going to continue

366
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:26,480
to develop this and we'll

367
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,160
send it to the list and um

368
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,080
please pay particular attention to the

369
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,280
recommendations because we want to make

370
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,720
sure that we're all in agreement on

371
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,039
those

372
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
thanks

373
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,399
okay i think this will be thomas

374
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,080
and all right great you want to do your

375
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
own slides awesome

376
00:17:49,360 --> 00:18:03,840
all right good to see you

377
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,879
you should be able to hear me as well

378
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,879
can you see my screen

379
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,280
can you see my screen um

380
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:21,360
check yes

381
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:25,440
good okay great so

382
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,399
good um today i'm uh thomas gough from

383
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,360
swisscom

384
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:34,400
i'm presenting the bnp young project

385
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,000
on the virtual hackathon itf-109 for the

386
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,000
growing netconf working group

387
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,199
in this hackathon in regards of

388
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,879
bmp we're focusing on this uh bmp draft

389
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
where we also see later some

390
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:54,000
presentations

391
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,840
in this working group but also

392
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,799
also regarding ipfix and bgp local rip

393
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,799
correlation

394
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,360
with iphix identity 90 and as well

395
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,720
uh we were also testing performance

396
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,280
impact of pnp

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:14,559
in terms of cpu and energy resources

398
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:18,080
on the route processor in regards of

399
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,639
yang we are working on two drafts on udp

400
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,840
notif and distribute motif

401
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,200
to have a very lightweight way of

402
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,240
collecting

403
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
young data from routers

404
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,280
these are the open source software we

405
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,840
have been using in the lab

406
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,240
this is the lab topology consisting of

407
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,159
an mls vpn network

408
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,919
with various traffic and pgp generators

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
to validate the metrics throughout the

410
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,160
lab

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
uh so this time new this is the fourth

412
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
time

413
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:57,679
in the itf hackathon we added some more

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,120
uh different type of vendors

415
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,000
so maybe this is cryo 6r xc juniper

416
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,158
noise and also f4 mounting an open

417
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,320
source routing system

418
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:13,440
all of them exposing ibfx and bmp

419
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,520
we were focusing also on yang schema

420
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,840
data collections

421
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,039
and we identified some gaps in our live

422
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,639
set in terms of scalability

423
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:28,320
data ingestion into the time series db

424
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,120
emp bgp is relatively spiky

425
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,840
so we needed to adjust the test set up

426
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,158
there to accommodate this

427
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,158
this is currently working progress

428
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,840
on the data collection site on pmact

429
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,400
the decoding of the bmptlds namely on

430
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,760
our policy attribute tracing and emp

431
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
path marking

432
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,520
continued we have now pretty good

433
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
coverage there

434
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,760
and also some extensions in device of

435
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:03,840
correlating egb location and iphix

436
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,039
has been done and as well on the udp

437
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,480
notif

438
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,440
data collection this is

439
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,240
just an example on the time series

440
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,520
database

441
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,799
regarding empire policy attribute

442
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,360
tracing

443
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,840
you can see here on uh screenshots from

444
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,120
an

445
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,320
apple sp router basically for given

446
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,360
ethics in a birth through which

447
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,559
birth down policy and also

448
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,600
type of policy this prefix has been

449
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,600
propagated through

450
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,439
here another example of uh egyptian

451
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,480
local

452
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,440
ipfix correlation showing basically on

453
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,320
the pe about

454
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,400
the test flow being successfully

455
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,439
correlated with bgp

456
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:55,039
standard communities

457
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,600
here another example of the correlation

458
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:04,559
on emp located with path marking

459
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:08,399
showing a particular path in the earth

460
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,399
the best and primary

461
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,880
on the huawei vlp site uh

462
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,960
the support of uh path marking and our

463
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,679
policy attribute racing has been

464
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,440
extended

465
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,600
and adopted to the latest releases

466
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
as well the coverage on europe no

467
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,240
different distributor

468
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,719
for the young push data collection we

469
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,159
have

470
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,720
been performing some performance tests

471
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,559
and to measure the cpu memory impact of

472
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,600
pmp

473
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,000
this is an example uh for two data sets

474
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,320
where we

475
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,440
were interesting uh hundred thousand and

476
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,080
five hundred thousand

477
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:54,720
rounds uh to see the impact on cp usage

478
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,399
as expected uh since the bgp propagation

479
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,960
uh has impact on the cpu usage the cpu

480
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,120
usage

481
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,840
increased but uh due to the

482
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,479
back pressure mechanism of the bgp to

483
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,918
bmp

484
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:13,760
implementation within the bgp

485
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:17,760
process almost or the

486
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,760
the memory increase is very minimal

487
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,440
on the wireshark on the desector side uh

488
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,840
the work is currently ongoing to also

489
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,200
support the path marking tlv

490
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:33,280
and the udp notif implementation

491
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
so we are looking very forward within

492
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,360
the next one or two weeks

493
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,600
you have that one and done as well

494
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,279
what we learned in the hacker tom yeah

495
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,000
it's the fourth time so the

496
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,120
team's getting really worked nicely

497
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
together

498
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,279
we were mainly to keep connected using

499
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,559
slack

500
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,760
and yeah again the bad part was them no

501
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,399
no beers and cocktails afterwards i want

502
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,879
to thank

503
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,080
uh all the people who were within the

504
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,880
group

505
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,120
uh is alexis dolly from vaya shark we

506
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,400
had many people joining from inside the

507
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,840
university

508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,679
siena and sang and also of course huawei

509
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,840
ndt and some from swisscom

510
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
that's all thank you very much

511
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:33,840
want some questions thomas

512
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,600
all right i guess no question is uh

513
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,600
vivio around

514
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
and do you want to do your own

515
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:50,559
presentation or

516
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,679
i just tried to share my screen

517
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,200
uh and i just see you

518
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,840
sending video i don't think you're

519
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
trying to pretend

520
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,799
there we go there we go

521
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,919
as a note to other presenters that it

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,840
works best if your

523
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,120
web browser can just share a single

524
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,639
application not

525
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,439
the screen so we don't have the fall

526
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,440
through the youtube

527
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,080
dive in mode going on like we do now

528
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,240
sorry

529
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:31,360
that's okay just

530
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,799
right can you hear me yes and we can see

531
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,918
your screen

532
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,559
great okay so i'm leaving from

533
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,279
eta zurich and i did my master thesis in

534
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,360
collaboration with swisscom

535
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,279
and i would like to build up on some of

536
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,279
the aspects that thomas was mentioning

537
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,919
in his previous presentation

538
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,640
and show some practical implementation

539
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,000
practical aspects of bmp

540
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,919
so more specifically i investigated we

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,279
investigated bmp capabilities in a

542
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,720
special type of

543
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,480
network in ampules vpn layer 3 network

544
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,400
and we built a pipeline end-to-end

545
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,880
pipeline that drained that

546
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,200
consists of everything from exporting

547
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,080
bmp data collecting it

548
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,080
processing storing and visualizing it

549
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,480
and the goal was to do a correlation on

550
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,360
a vpn level where bnp is just a small

551
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,440
part

552
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,799
where we also included forwarding plane

553
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,640
metrics for ipfix which then enables

554
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,600
root cause analysis and

555
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
real-time performance monitoring so if

556
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,678
you quickly look at the bgp protocol

557
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,879
which bmp monitors

558
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,760
then essentially we have two different

559
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,440
entities we have rips so-called routing

560
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,919
information basis

561
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,760
which is just a list of prefixes with

562
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,159
attached attributes

563
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,840
and an example of this is a pgp update

564
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,720
message that can be seen on the right

565
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,799
side

566
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
now we have so-called route policies

567
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,000
which operate

568
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:01,120
on the routes so they can modify drop

569
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,080
permit them and so on and if you look at

570
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
bmp

571
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,080
what bmp enables and this was an

572
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,158
iterative approach so

573
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:13,439
the first standard was done in 2016

574
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,720
and enabled access to json3 bin

575
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,080
pre and post policy it also set up the

576
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,520
protocol mechanics

577
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,199
in terms of communication and it was

578
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,559
also possible to send certain statistics

579
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
and in the next step it enabled access

580
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,840
to

581
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,200
adjacency about this is also a standard

582
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,959
by now

583
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,120
and you can all probably also see the

584
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,320
trend here in next step

585
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,199
if you wanted to know what routes are

586
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,678
actually installed

587
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
independent of the bgp peering we

588
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,159
enabled access to the local rip

589
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,279
and this is also so if you if you

590
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,240
imagine that

591
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,279
a bgpp receives hundreds of thousands of

592
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
updates

593
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,919
but only a tiny subset of them actually

594
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,360
modify the forwarding state of the

595
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,360
router it makes

596
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,360
it's a big efficiency game if you just

597
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,678
monitor the local rip

598
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,520
but monitoring the low grip also enables

599
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,760
certain

600
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,679
correlations that were not possible

601
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,158
without it

602
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:21,679
that's the case in mpls vpn network

603
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,080
and sometimes there are

604
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,559
multiple paths for a prefix for example

605
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,480
if you have a network that is built with

606
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,120
redundancy in mind

607
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,120
and there the goal is to have an

608
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,559
additional path marking draft where you

609
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,879
can see okay

610
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,320
this path for this prefix is the primary

611
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,240
path this password is

612
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,360
a backup pass so we can see the

613
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
redundancy

614
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,600
throughout the network and as a last

615
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
step we enabled

616
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,678
access to route policies

617
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,080
where we can see which policies were

618
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,880
triggered and which modified routes and

619
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,279
how

620
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,919
this is just a quick evolution of bmp

621
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,559
and what we were most interested in is

622
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,799
to do

623
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,760
to apply all of that in a special type

624
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,879
of network in an

625
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,799
mpls bgprp virtual private network

626
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,480
which is a common architectural rise

627
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:16,480
piece because it enables multiple vpns

628
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,840
to be run over the same physical

629
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,679
infrastructure

630
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,439
we have a couple entities here so we

631
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,159
have to see your routers which is

632
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,720
just a route from the customer's premise

633
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,919
provider actual assist which is on the

634
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,159
provider's premise which borrows to the

635
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,919
customer edge router and then we have an

636
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,360
mpls core

637
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,840
and the routers in there which is

638
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,120
denoted as p routers

639
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,080
and what we

640
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,320
have is that if multiple vpns want to

641
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,080
share the same prefix which should be

642
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,279
um possible then we need a way to sort

643
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,158
of distinguish them

644
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,919
so then a new concept is called virtual

645
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
routing and forwarding in systems

646
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,399
is used to isolate the routing stables

647
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
of the different vpns

648
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,080
and there's a route distinguished

649
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,520
touched route distinguisher attached to

650
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,559
a vrf

651
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,039
and basically this creates also a new

652
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,799
address family the vpn v4 v6 which is

653
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,120
essentially just a concatenation of a

654
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,360
route distinguished with ip address

655
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,399
and with that we can actually make the

656
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,600
same prefixes from multiple vpns

657
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,360
unique and this is also important for

658
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,439
the correlation later on if you want to

659
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,959
do a correlation on the vpn level

660
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,520
and as has been shown by thomas

661
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,640
in his previous presentation this is the

662
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,760
lab network that we tried to experiment

663
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
with bmp

664
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,320
we have a couple of beer artists in the

665
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,840
middle row then we have multiple vendors

666
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,080
cisco who are by juniper and we even

667
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,480
use f for routing as c routers we have a

668
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,840
route reflection we have spyron for

669
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,720
traffic generation now we wanted to do

670
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,840
here is that

671
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,919
we first wanted to export the data

672
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,519
so we had to specify which trips and

673
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,000
which address families

674
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,320
is obviously vendor-specific then we use

675
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,120
the collection software pmact

676
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,240
which we are previous as well and there

677
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
was

678
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,080
there the route distinguisher that we

679
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,200
just mentioned before

680
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,559
was used to correlate ipfix and bnp

681
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,559
message so in the end

682
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,799
our goal is to sort of make queries for

683
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,760
a specific vpn

684
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,760
and the correlation enabled us to enrich

685
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,000
the forwarding plane with control plane

686
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,240
attributes such as the as path

687
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,279
or standard community attributes which

688
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,360
encode vpn information

689
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,720
and one of the supported backends of

690
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,240
pmact is

691
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,080
kafka so we use that as our

692
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
message broker which is able to buffer

693
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,519
the data

694
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:53,279
we use we we split the bmp

695
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,960
output of pmact into its individual

696
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,559
message types to make it a bit more

697
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,279
scalable and then we

698
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,000
ingested it into a time series database

699
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,600
through it which

700
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
is optimized for event data

701
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,039
and as a last step we use the node.js

702
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,600
application

703
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,799
to handle requests between the front-end

704
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,918
and the

705
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,799
database and the front end

706
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,919
is an interactive ui which can filter

707
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,480
the data

708
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,559
and shows the resulting graph and to

709
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,760
linger a bit longer on that point so

710
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,918
the visualization supports on the one

711
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,760
hand exploratory for a given time range

712
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,120
but also real-time queries

713
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,840
for different pmp message types we want

714
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,158
to

715
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,399
achieve a correlation in this type of

716
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,159
network that i showed on a vpn level

717
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,239
under time

718
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,600
across the two planes to make cause and

719
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,679
effect visible

720
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,360
so on the bottom is the screenshot of

721
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,519
the application where we see on the left

722
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,439
side the control plane

723
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,080
with different filters for standard

724
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,360
communities which as i said encode vpn

725
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,799
information

726
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,360
rip selection and also timestamps

727
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,519
and if you just want to look at an

728
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,519
example query let's say

729
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,840
we have a query where we say for a

730
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,600
specific vpn show me a certain rip for

731
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,080
example the chase ribbon

732
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,600
pre-policy and its correlation to the

733
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,199
forwarding plane

734
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,120
and the events that we're interested in

735
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,080
is just enabling

736
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,439
so um removing and enabling an interface

737
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,519
on a vpn level

738
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,440
so on the left hand side we have

739
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,279
removing of the interface so as soon as

740
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,320
we take the interface down

741
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,919
we have pgp updates propagating through

742
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,360
the network which are then

743
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,200
exported with bmp now we can see here on

744
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,080
the left hand side is the control plane

745
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,120
graph

746
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,439
where the nodes or the vertices are just

747
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,518
the loopback addresses of the routers

748
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,080
and the edges are the next tops and we

749
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,320
use prefix here as an aggregated form

750
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,879
because there are multiple prefixes that

751
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,760
can have the same next top

752
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,279
and the edges are color coded and red

753
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,960
means that which we just

754
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,440
withdraw message and the interesting

755
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
thing is that for one this is on a vpn

756
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,080
level and on the other hand which is

757
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
correlating time

758
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,319
we have this vertical bar that shows

759
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,520
where in the forwarding plane this event

760
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,720
actually happened

761
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,440
and because we used uh or we disabled an

762
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,879
interface that was generating traffic we

763
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,359
can see that the traffic

764
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,440
broke down at the same time and after a

765
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,839
couple minutes we re-enabled it again

766
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,918
and here the caller is screen that means

767
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,839
we have a pgp update message that was

768
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:30,879
captured with bmp

769
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,839
and then the traffic pattern um

770
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,679
went back to normal and so this is just

771
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,440
a toy example this just shows that what

772
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,879
kind of information that we can get out

773
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
of it so if you're interested in this

774
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,239
kind of event

775
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,199
we can dig a little deeper for example

776
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,158
you can see okay

777
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,879
let me change the the rip on the

778
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,800
left-hand side

779
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,319
now we have the adjacent strip out for

780
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,040
exactly this event

781
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,320
for enabling the interface and here

782
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,440
again the nodes are the

783
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,160
loopback addresses of the routers the

784
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,440
edges are the next hops and we have

785
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,759
additional fields that when we

786
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,040
click on the edges that we can see the

787
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,200
prefixes that

788
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,640
had this specific prip and bgp next up

789
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,078
tuple

790
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,598
and on the right hand side we have the

791
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,920
route policies that were mentioned in

792
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,599
previous presentations as well

793
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
and this is essentially a bipartite

794
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,560
graph with the bmp

795
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,560
routers that exported the bmp data

796
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,000
in one set and the route policies in

797
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,799
another set

798
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,599
and the edge label is appearing over

799
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,359
which that route policy is triggered

800
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,720
and let's say if you're interested in

801
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,319
more information then we

802
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,759
can just click on a certain vertex

803
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,480
for example this one up here and then we

804
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,940
have a

805
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,520
an additional

806
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,599
[Music]

807
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,280
additional information for example

808
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,800
policy class this

809
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,119
route policy corresponding to whether

810
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,599
the

811
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,839
route policy was matched whether the

812
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,920
route was permitted and so on

813
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,599
how we even included

814
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,400
um an an additional text field where we

815
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,680
actually

816
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,880
use an rpc call with with netconf young

817
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,919
where we called or queried the

818
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,640
router directly for its route policy

819
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,599
and as a maybe to conclude it's just a

820
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
toy example

821
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,040
can we can see that with just a very

822
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,520
simple

823
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,320
excel we can get a whole lot of

824
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,880
information

825
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,079
out which can be used for all kinds of

826
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:41,839
use cases

827
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:41,839
okay thank you very much

828
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
anybody have any questions

829
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,440
like where can i download the software

830
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
and what is required to run it on my

831
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,839
image on my

832
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,839
network that sort of question

833
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,640
no

834
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,240
[Music]

835
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,839
all right thank you very much olivia

836
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,839
that was pretty cool uh

837
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,839
paulo

838
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,200
uh do you want to uh run your own

839
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,440
presentation too

840
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:23,520
yes uh let me try that i'm

841
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,640
technology is one of my weak points so

842
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,800
all right we can hear you and

843
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,560
shortly your screen should share

844
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,960
hopefully not in fall into the

845
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,839
mode mode yes i'm trying i'm trying to

846
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,359
do that i'm trying to do that

847
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,359
um one second

848
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:51,598
[Music]

849
00:37:41,040 --> 00:38:04,240
it could be this one no it's not

850
00:37:51,599 --> 00:38:08,480
oh all right

851
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,479
i'm trying to fix this one second

852
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,839
entire screen

853
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,920
it is so confusing when you want to just

854
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,320
select

855
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,119
one screen okay i think

856
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,320
somehow the linux version of all this

857
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,640
got the

858
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,160
whole thing correct where they give you

859
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,000
a

860
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,520
different tabs and you can press the tab

861
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,040
for the applications and select this

862
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,720
particular one

863
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,720
right and

864
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,879
otherwise i will share the whole screen

865
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,879
once again

866
00:38:51,599 --> 00:39:01,839
yeah i can i can't i can't find

867
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,839
what i'm looking for so okay

868
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:17,759
all right

869
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,040
yep fall into the moat mode accomplished

870
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,079
great okay now we can see just the

871
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,279
presentation

872
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,560
fantastic fantastic i cannot see the

873
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,079
i can see only my presentation okay uh

874
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,599
so uh very quickly two updates on uh

875
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:38,320
uh the tlv draft and on the tlv

876
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:42,000
ebit draft um so i start from the tlv1

877
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,680
um we you know problem statement of

878
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,880
the tlv just as a super quick recap

879
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,359
like uh extend uh support for tlv's to

880
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,200
all

881
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,440
uh bmp messages so cover specifically

882
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,640
with monitoring and peer down

883
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,240
and in order to achieve that we bump the

884
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,078
version for backwards compatibility

885
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,200
and so what happens uh since uh igf-106

886
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,560
uh since we didn't present at 107 and

887
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:16,000
108 it's that we had two

888
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:19,520
new versions the three and four

889
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,599
uh so just for historical so

890
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:23,200
what happened mainly is that we post

891
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,119
ourselves the problem of

892
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,879
per angulari tlds so

893
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,200
the fact that in root monitoring

894
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,119
messages you have a bgp update message

895
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,200
and in the bgp update message you can

896
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,520
have multiple nlri

897
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,240
and then maybe you want to correlate a

898
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,319
specific

899
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,118
tlv uh to a specific nlri

900
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,599
um so of course we didn't want to be

901
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,640
just

902
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,800
positional like you know

903
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
basing on some sort of ordering of the

904
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,520
tlps because that can be

905
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
very easily screwed up so for just for a

906
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,800
little bit of history something that we

907
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,079
never presented and you know we already

908
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,599
uh deemed as a destruction of a few

909
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,800
months

910
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,359
our first attempt went to go for let me

911
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
let me call them tlv containers to

912
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,119
achieve that

913
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,680
um tlb containers would be like that you

914
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,400
have a

915
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,279
tlv for example let's say for pot

916
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,920
marking

917
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,800
and then inside that tlv you have some

918
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,640
tlvs

919
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,040
right um so and the subtle this would be

920
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,440
just

921
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,800
ordered you know specifically the way in

922
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,359
which you want to you know

923
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,800
the the first dlv would be matching the

924
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,000
first you know

925
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,240
angular i and things like that

926
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,359
this method you know we deleted it

927
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,680
from history because um

928
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:49,839
let's say it was bringing you know some

929
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,118
disadvantages it was a little bit

930
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,920
complex also uh you have the problem

931
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,800
when you don't want to attach a tlb to a

932
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,440
specific

933
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,560
a specific angular i like you have i

934
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,440
don't know three four

935
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,359
five rise and you want to attach it tlb

936
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,319
only to the first and to the third and

937
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,560
to the fourth

938
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,240
so it was come becoming a little bit

939
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,359
clutchy you can have

940
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,560
null tlvs but it was bad

941
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,040
so we restored a little bit of

942
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,000
simplicity in the whole thing and so in

943
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,119
version 4

944
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,319
which was published just yesterday

945
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,359
um we have indexed what we call indexed

946
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,480
tlds so essentially it's just a super

947
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,920
normal tlb

948
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,599
it's just that the very first value

949
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,119
the first two bytes of the value it's

950
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,400
the index so uh the index starts

951
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,880
at zero so the index zero would be for

952
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,800
the first

953
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,359
tlb and and so forth um

954
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,200
super cool uh for the moment we are

955
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,240
leaving to the

956
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,759
uh let's say to the specific application

957
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,879
you know so the index tlv would be like

958
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,440
a recommendation

959
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,640
let's say like how to encode you know

960
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,240
per nlri

961
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,720
dlvs and it's left to the specific

962
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,279
uh for the moment it's left to the

963
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,319
specific application the knowledge that

964
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,520
you know uh there will be an indexes so

965
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,800
the the tlp

966
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,160
it's indexed or it's per nlri in other

967
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,119
words we are not adding

968
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,440
a flag or anything like that to say that

969
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,640
the

970
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:32,319
specific nlri is indexed

971
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,680
right uh we may think about that

972
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,640
we are open to feedback on that one

973
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,960
specific item uh it would be nice to

974
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,759
have

975
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,319
you know consistent tlvs and i

976
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,960
specifically come from the ipfix

977
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,079
you know experience where you know you

978
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,880
have this tlb

979
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,560
kind of protocol where everything auto

980
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,680
parses very nicely so

981
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,040
be able to have you know a flag for

982
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,279
something um would be nice but

983
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,800
you know we are open for feedback and

984
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,119
on that other changes uh

985
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,160
we added the operational considerations

986
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,200
section uh

987
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,640
which is largely based on jeff

988
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,839
has feedback thanks very much jeff for

989
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:23,839
your feedback

990
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,839
and there were minor editorial changes

991
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,040
i present also this and maybe then we

992
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,520
can do questions at the end if there is

993
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,200
any

994
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,680
uh so on the ebit side of the things uh

995
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,399
what is the you know problem statement

996
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,598
um i

997
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,720
i will actually kind of skip the ebit

998
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,599
problem statement

999
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,560
because there was uh you know a quite a

1000
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,200
large recap

1001
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,480
on the mailing list on what this is

1002
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,799
about so

1003
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,520
uh you see here you know the problem

1004
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
statement

1005
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,960
uh mentioned in the draft but we went

1006
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,319
also through

1007
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,240
you know some other uh possible they it

1008
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,279
emerged on the mailing list a few other

1009
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,200
possible use cases for this draft right

1010
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,480
and so what is the status and next steps

1011
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,839
and this is my last slide um so

1012
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,280
there is not really many open questions

1013
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:20,078
um since uh you know uh

1014
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,040
there was not much feedback to this

1015
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,599
draft

1016
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,839
a couple of weeks ago i sent an email

1017
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,160
with a little bit of a recap and asking

1018
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,480
a little bit for

1019
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,359
support not support and things like that

1020
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,480
i think we

1021
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,560
received some uh you know positive

1022
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,760
feedback so definitely positive feedback

1023
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,599
no negative feedback and

1024
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,280
the actual feedback is going to be

1025
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,760
processed that there was quite some

1026

and um it's actually been

1052
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,640
a year since i uh presented this draft

1053
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,280
at itf 106. um

1054
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,680
well actually we've been working on the

1055
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,800
you know the revision and also the

1056
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,720
implementation of this draft for almost

1057
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,760
two years and so today

1058
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,558
i want to discuss with you the latest um

1059
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,200
you know

1060
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,720
status of this draft and also i would

1061
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,839
like to discuss with the

1062
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:55,520
working group uh how we can like take

1063
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,520
this draft uh one step further

1064
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:03,920
uh so first i'll i'll quickly uh recap

1065
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:06,960
uh you with um the hacksaw example

1066
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,040
um that we have for this feature

1067
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,960
and then we're going to look at the

1068
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,319
latest uh

1069
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,839
status of the format

1070
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,000
and then we'll discuss the next steps

1071
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:23,040
okay

1072
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,680
so um in a nutshell uh what this draft

1073
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,800
is

1074
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:30,000
does is that it basically uh

1075
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,200
records uh the processing the root

1076
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,720
policy processing

1077
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,439
uh in the device and then encapsulate

1078
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,640
uh the root policy processing data with

1079
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,920
bmp and also

1080
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,118
export uh the data using a new bmp

1081
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,359
message

1082
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,599
so um in this figure you can see in the

1083
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,480
in the left column uh there are

1084
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,920
different uh

1085
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,559
data data fields these are the

1086
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,440
raw data fields that you catch from the

1087
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,640
bmp

1088
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,119
retrace message and then in the right

1089
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,200
part

1090
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,599
what you can do is like basically you

1091
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,799
drag uh you know different

1092
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,599
data fields uh to either the filtering

1093
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,720
column or

1094
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,839
the show column okay so for example in

1095
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,160
this example

1096
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,040
we want to show you in the last five

1097
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,480
minutes

1098
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:24,400
uh what this .71 router

1099
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:28,240
is doing under a certain vrf

1100
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,520
indicated indicated by this

1101
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:34,879
rd and then in the show

1102
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:39,040
column basically you can select uh

1103
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:42,640
different fields to structurize

1104
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:47,359
uh the data to the way that you want to

1105
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:50,799
uh viralize the data so here we

1106
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:53,920
sorry so here uh

1107
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,079
we showed uh three data fields the first

1108
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,800
is the brf name and then the policy

1109
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:04,000
class and also the policy name

1110
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:06,960
so for this router under the vrf c20

1111
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,599
basically we can see here we have four

1112
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,960
types of

1113
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,760
policies the inbound policy the vrf

1114
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,119
export and the root withdrawal and

1115
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,000
outbound policy

1116
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,280
and we can also see that under each

1117
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,800
policy class

1118
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:26,000
uh under a a specific

1119
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,800
root policy name how many events uh is

1120
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,359
going on okay and for those names with

1121
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,160
uh

1122
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,960
with an r it basically means the policy

1123
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,359
either

1124
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,160
uh either the policy is not configured

1125
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,440
under

1126
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,558
a specific group policy or you know

1127
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,520
uh the route is processed you know by

1128
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,800
some uh

1129
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,000
default uh configurations so

1130
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,720
uh next uh we wanna zoom into

1131
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:57,920
this uh two events

1132
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,118
so what we can see from the

1133
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,760
the raw data parsed is that it's

1134
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,960
actually

1135
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,880
uh two uh two prefixes uh

1136
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,599
dot ten and dot uh 252

1137
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,720
which are received from the same bgp

1138
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,760
peer

1139
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:19,759
and they are processed by the

1140
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,559
inbound policy and the policy

1141
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,200
is a match and the match result is to

1142
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,319
permit

1143
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,839
the policy and then this policies div

1144
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:34,319
field tells you whether the bgp

1145
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:37,279
attributes before the policy and

1146
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,119
after the policy is different so if it's

1147
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,160
one then it basically means uh

1148
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,400
it's different so to look at the the the

1149
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,960
detailed difference you you want to go

1150
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,400
to the pre-policy attributes and the

1151
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,119
post policy

1152
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,079
attribute but here we didn't actually

1153
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,480
fully uh

1154
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,680
parse the two fields but uh once you do

1155
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,800
you can see

1156
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,440
uh the difference okay so

1157
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:06,480
uh that finished the the quick recap

1158
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,599
and this is the latest format

1159
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:13,839
that we have for the root trace

1160
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,640
um in fact from the zero three and the

1161
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,078
row

1162
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,680
four version we didn't make

1163
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:25,119
very big changes to the format

1164
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,759
just minor ones and uh also i i

1165
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,680
want to talk about the details of the

1166
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,240
formats instead i want to discuss

1167
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,839
something

1168
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,598
else with you so i'll just go ahead and

1169
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:38,480
skip

1170
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,440
and this is the changes from the last

1171
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,800
version

1172
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:47,359
okay and

1173
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:49,359
so a big thing that i want to

1174
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:52,240
discuss with the working group today is

1175
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,558
that um how can we move this work

1176
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,319
uh forward and before that i want to

1177
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,319
update you with the current uh

1178
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,839
implementation status of the

1179
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:07,200
of the draft and also some deployment

1180
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:10,558
status and future plans okay

1181
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:14,319
so we have now a huawei vrp

1182
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:17,760
latest version that supports

1183
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:21,359
the latest draft as a bmp client

1184
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,800
and we have pmact that supports the

1185
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,240
latest version

1186
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,599
draft as the bmp server and we also have

1187
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:33,839
wildshark that supports the parsing

1188
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,119
okay and uh for deployment we have been

1189
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,160
testing this feature

1190
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:42,640
um in the swisscom um test lab for

1191
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:45,920
uh almost for over a year and um

1192
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:49,359
for actual uh uh deployment uh

1193
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,160
in in the production network uh what

1194
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:52,880
the information um i have here is that

1195
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,839
uh first

1196
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,800
it there could be plans in the tension

1197
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,558
network

1198
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,079
actually uh this draft is also a

1199
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,359
requirement from

1200
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,680
the uh tencent and who is also one of

1201
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,880
the

1202
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,078
co-authors and the second is the new uh

1203
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,240
ixp

1204
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:15,280
in china um luckily i was

1205
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:18,558
involved involved in this ixp project

1206
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,839
um since uh this i think

1207
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,480
uh this year may and uh

1208
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,359
i've been introduced since feature to

1209
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,400
them they are pretty interested

1210
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:33,440
but for the exact

1211
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,040
you know deployment uh plan i i

1212
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,240
currently don't have

1213
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,279
and also uh for uh hoy cloud they also

1214
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,959
have plans uh

1215
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:46,160
to uh deploy this uh feature

1216
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,119
okay so uh with uh

1217
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,399
you know these uh things going on what i

1218
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,359
i want to

1219
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,000
ask from the working group and also the

1220
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,119
chairs

1221
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,040
is that shall we consider uh the

1222
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,559
adoption of this uh

1223
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:05,599
draft as a working group document

1224
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,760
and also we would like

1225
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,880
earlier allocations for the following

1226
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,559
code points

1227
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:16,960
uh because we are going to

1228
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:20,319
deploy the feature in actual networks

1229
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,839
unless that's a plan but i do understand

1230
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,558
there are still uh

1231
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,240
concerns and uh maybe even big concerns

1232
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,520
from uh the working group

1233
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,839
and uh i'm i i would really

1234
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,839
like to discuss these uh

1235
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,839
concerns

1236
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,200
good jeff

1237
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,400
hi jeff ask um wasn't it the case at

1238
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,160
some point we talked about changing the

1239
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,200
registration policy

1240
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,480
uh for the bmp message types

1241
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,078
i i think the real issue here is that

1242
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,599
we don't have any first come first serve

1243
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,599
and this is a good candidate for that

1244
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,480
i thought that john maybe he's here and

1245
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,000
remembers i thought we

1246
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,960
pushed through a change that turned into

1247
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,960
a first come first serve

1248
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:28,559
john scutter i mean i am here i

1249
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:30,960
don't remember that sounds right i mean

1250
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,880
somebody could go look at the registry

1251
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,160
right now but

1252
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:37,040
yeah i'm checking now i was looking at

1253
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,040
the rfc sorry

1254
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,599
um it is currently still

1255
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,520
half the code points are standards

1256
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:49,920
action the other half or specification

1257
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,920
required

1258
00:56:51,920 --> 00:57:00,960
so it has to be a working group document

1259
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,960
for early occasion am i right

1260
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,280
um so not speaking for the chairs of

1261
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,400
this group

1262
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:12,240
my memory of specification required

1263
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,079
is that a internet draft is present

1264
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,439
and it doesn't even necessarily have to

1265
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,280
be an internet draft you could actually

1266
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,480
do standards in another organization and

1267
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,520
just simply say

1268
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:23,520
this is where it's specified at so

1269
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,960
there are options be done but it still

1270
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:29,359
requires chair action

1271
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,960
specification required is weird i don't

1272
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,960
remember the details but i think it's

1273
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:38,400
it's it may not work the way you said

1274
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:41,920
but standards action certainly can um

1275
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,760
you can get an early allocation and

1276
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,520
i don't think standards allocate

1277
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,040
standards action technically requires

1278
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,000
you to be a working group draft which is

1279
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,359
kind of weird it's

1280
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,359
it's chairs discretion

1281
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,839
i think

1282
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:04,799
as chairs will take a to-do item up to

1283
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:06,000
see where the registry reclassification

1284
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,400
project is

1285
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,680
because i suspect it got lost somewhere

1286
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,359
in the

1287
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,359
2020 dumpster fire

1288
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,558
uh so in summary to you and

1289
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:26,000
you want to get working group adoption

1290
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:28,480
call going and explore ayana

1291
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,119
early allocations uh and with both

1292
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:34,240
action items we will help you

1293
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:37,839
all right thanks thanks a lot and

1294
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,839
warren might have a question i think

1295
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,759
so um so specification required i'll put

1296
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,400
the actual text in the chat

1297
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,240
but basically the designated expert has

1298
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,280
to say it seems mostly sane

1299
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,759
and then you need a permanent and ready

1300
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:59,119
of a

1301
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:02,400
readily available specification um

1302
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,480
so um it needs to be

1303
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,000
sort of relatively stable it's unclear

1304
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:09,520
that an internet draft is that

1305
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,520
if it's expected that the

1306
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:13,200
format and protocol will still be

1307
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:22,799
changing okay

1308
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,799
thank you thank you

1309
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:29,359
and provided no other questions

1310
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:37,200
we can skip on to cameo

1311
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:40,319
thank you thank you

1312
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:44,319
hello hello

1313
00:59:40,319 --> 01:00:00,000
do you want to present your screen or

1314
00:59:44,319 --> 01:00:04,000
present your application we'll try that

1315
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,599
cannot check but i i also kind of cheer

1316
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,599
specific apps so um

1317
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:11,759
i think i just i pushed the wrong button

1318
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,960
sorry you have to click again

1319
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,400
[Music]

1320
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,240
i have to click again okay yeah yeah i

1321
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,680
clicked on the kick you out of screen

1322
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,919
share button instead of add your screen

1323
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:24,480
share button

1324
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,480
yeah i don't want to show group can't

1325
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,319
show the tabs so

1326
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,040
the screen should be i don't want to

1327
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:34,160
waste more time

1328
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,720
okay yep

1329
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:39,279
seems like i cannot share the screen for

1330
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,279
some reason

1331
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,799
okay well one more try while it tries

1332
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,720
again

1333
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:50,079
again let's try it again

1334
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,000
share the screen now

1335
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:53,200
it says error the object cannot be found

1336
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,559
whatever okay

1337
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,359
no no let me find yeah will you help me

1338
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,359
with the slides please

1339
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,680
yes one moment while i rearrange my

1340
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,839
screen

1341
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:11,839
that it works

1342
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,599
perfect okay

1343
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,240
so this is an update on the bmp body

1344
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:31,119
status dlp draft

1345
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,118
the next one please

1346
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,118
so as a brief recap the idea of this

1347
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,359
draft is

1348
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:42,640
that is to convey bad status over airbnb

1349
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,359
so bad status being whether a path is

1350
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,319
installed

1351
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:48,160
whether whether a path is not that so

1352
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,040
whether about this best path whether

1353
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,480
it's the

1354
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,160
whether or not it's not a best part

1355
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,640
where you're we're still using it for

1356
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,359
forwarding so we call that primary

1357
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,680
whether it's a backup path so this kind

1358
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,359
of

1359
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:05,038
thing um did you mention it on his

1360
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:08,799
on also his on his stock so

1361
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:10,240
is that kind of so the data

1362
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,440
could be useful i guess for some use

1363
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,240
cases uh it depends on the bmp dlp draft

1364
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,280
and on the eb

1365
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,680
draft two that paul just mentioned

1366
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:20,640
so we also have a reason field which now

1367
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,520
is optional

1368
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,118
uh the reason field could include stuff

1369
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,000
like hey this path is

1370
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,200
best path because i don't know has

1371
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,880
higher local preference

1372
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,160
stuff like that so it might be a bit

1373
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,039
complicated to for for every use case

1374
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,078
but it could be useful for

1375
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,799
troubleshooting um yeah we decided to

1376
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,079
set it as

1377
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,640
optional now uh since it might not be

1378
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,119
useful

1379
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,839
every time could you do the next one

1380
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,839
please

1381
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,799
okay as um overview of the latest

1382
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,200
changes so we didn't show it for a while

1383
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:59,280
we actually have been iterating over it

1384
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,879
uh it's very related to what paolo

1385
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,359
mentioned about the index

1386
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,559
so we have decision which and paulo just

1387
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:07,038
described it

1388
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:07,920
that we could not so it was complicated

1389
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,280
to point out

1390
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,559
what the tlb to which nlri was

1391
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,000
specifying we was

1392
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:17,839
it was referring to so we did some

1393
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,480
hacking issues so not somehow we did

1394
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:22,240
some we play with positions a bit

1395
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,240
but it was too complicated so we went

1396
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,319
into this index thing

1397
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,598
uh so basically it's a field numeric

1398
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,920
field in which you

1399
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,520
you may you you define there to which

1400
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,400
prefix on the bgp update

1401
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:36,799
you this the the specific tlb you're

1402
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:39,520
referring to

1403
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:41,200
seems to be fine so far so we also

1404
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,599
implemented a bit

1405
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,720
that basically allows you to so if you

1406
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,960
have your own

1407
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,160
i mean your own company status or your

1408
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,760
own reasons then

1409
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,000
there are no standardized then you can

1410
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,440
use that one and then

1411
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,160
i mean you can do any status you

1412
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,240
you wish until those styles are properly

1413
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,839
standardized hopefully

1414
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:03,520
and we also set the reason code now to

1415
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:04,720
be optional so it does i guess it

1416
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,799
doesn't waste time if you're not

1417
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:09,359
implementing it

1418
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:11,280
and those are basically the the main

1419
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:13,839
changes that we have

1420
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,839
the next one please

1421
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:19,359
in the implementation side um

1422
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,720
so we were doing these hackathons every

1423
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,119
every itf

1424
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:25,118
well i'm not so much involved but the

1425
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,240
draft has been there

1426
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:30,480
for a while but we realized that

1427
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,160
um waiting for every itf to let's say

1428
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,240
how an iteration on the draft

1429
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,640
between the router and the collector was

1430
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,720
taking too long and we had very good

1431
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,160
good discussions about it so we wanted

1432
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,598
to have something quickly

1433
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:46,240
so let's say quicker iterations um about

1434
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,440
the the the messages and how the format

1435
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,399
and all of that

1436
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,200
so we ended up um let's say implementing

1437
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,200
bmp

1438
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,879
in this framework python framework

1439
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,240
called scapi

1440
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,119
which is basically a framework that

1441
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,118
allows you to forge packets

1442
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,280
uh so we have kind of a prototype for

1443
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,319
bmp now it works so it

1444
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,039
includes the tlb the dlp options and in

1445
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,920
particular

1446
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:12,160
the path study option uh we made that

1447
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,400
work with the premises of the collector

1448
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,920
and that allows us to let's say have a

1449
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,000
quicker iterations

1450
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,680
so if we had a new version of the

1451
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,520
messages then we can just implement it

1452
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,598
there in a couple of days and

1453
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,920
make it work against the collector and

1454
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,920
just doing that we're doing it practical

1455
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,039
allows us to more quickly have

1456
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,839
discussions and

1457
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,599
stuff like that so it has been useful uh

1458
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,960
thomas olivier also showed that we have

1459
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,359
been testing this

1460
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,240
now let's see more end to end between

1461
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,680
router and

1462
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,598
let's say information systems on the

1463
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,879
hackathon project i'm not going to

1464
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:46,160
mention any more about that

1465
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,240
but has been this is good to try to work

1466
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:51,839
out practically in an end-to-end

1467
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:51,839
environment the next one please

1468
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:59,440
um so as the rest of the drafts

1469
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:01,039
we i i think we have enough iterations

1470
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,359
on this draft

1471
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,400
the data is there we but status can be

1472
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,520
useful for some

1473
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,200
um for some use cases we don't have a

1474
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,440
way of conveying that information

1475
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,640
so that's basically the gist of the

1476
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,000
draft

1477
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,960
obviously it depends on the other one so

1478
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,160
in the tlb

1479
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,240
and david and the others so

1480
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:23,440
we probably in the next weeks if nobody

1481
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,919
says anything we'll

1482
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,960
try to go for working group doc or

1483
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,839
whatever the

1484
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,839
shares suggest

1485
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:36,078
um yeah and that's it so if anybody has

1486
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:41,118
any questions then please

1487
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,119
i see has that break is there so

1488
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:48,000
hi it's jeff a quick comment on the

1489
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,119
index hack

1490
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,200
i i think it's a nice hack the i think

1491
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:55,680
major challenge there is that it's sort

1492
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,598
of assuming that the receiver is capable

1493
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,759
of parsing out the nlri

1494
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,880
which for cases where you're using route

1495
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,319
monitoring

1496
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,640
monitoring is mostly used for things

1497
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:04,640
that are

1498
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,640
been accepted by the stack and are able

1499
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,879
to be validated

1500
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,480
for route mirroring or something else

1501
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,039
similar you probably can't get around to

1502
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,520
doing that

1503
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,200
so you probably do need to restrict it

1504
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,160
to only being used for

1505
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,839
route monitoring and you may want to

1506
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,839
have further discussion about

1507
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:26,078
as part of the tlv work do you want to

1508
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,680
split the nlri out into separate fields

1509
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,079
that are a little bit easier to parse

1510
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,640
because

1511
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:32,000
one of the headaches bgp has had over

1512
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,680
the years is if you can't figure out

1513
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,920
where the nlri boundaries are

1514
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,118
just your person gets strange anyway and

1515
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,160
now you're actually building other

1516
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:43,359
fields based on

1517
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:45,359
success of being able to do that

1518
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,119
right in that regard i have to say that

1519
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,720
uh i have discussed with the

1520
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:53,280
the growth elb authors uh well basically

1521
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,399
uh that that this kind of infrastructure

1522
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,280
should should

1523
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,599
lay more in the tlb draft so that should

1524
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,079
be mandated by by that let's say general

1525
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,200
architectural draft than on the specific

1526
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,400
let's say content

1527
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,240
dlps because if every content dlp does

1528
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,880
anything differently then that would

1529
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,799
become kind of a mixture

1530
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,319
uh but but yeah i mean all of these

1531
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:24,880
comments are very useful

1532
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:27,759
and let's see

1533
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,759
any other questions

1534
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:39,839
and i think we finished up thank you

1535
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:39,839
camille

1536
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,519
all right i don't think there's anything

1537
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:52,559
else on there nothing else on the agenda

1538
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,679
if there are other topics that need to

1539
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:55,199
be discussed

1540
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,158

1543
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:07,839

1544
