68
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,169
intention to notice in the minutes that

69
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:48,020
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drawer not a very</font>

collaborative community another and

71
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:57,599
anyway anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will try to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

72
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:02,180

keep to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> java once i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> III</font>

75
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:14,250
make the presentation because according

76
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:16,229
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our according to our schedule we are</font>

77
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:20,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the first one in speaking</font>

78
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:24,589
anyway just in the previous meetings we

79
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:29,099
have had some scent of announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

80
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:31,440
ongoing research event related to an EV

81
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,709
but the problem is that's well you have

82
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,419
too many of them it's sort of that the

83
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:37,420
the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have become completely</font>

84
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,299
crutch

85
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,760
by the number well it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be not</font>

86
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,800
accurate and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful or</font>

87
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:50,050
whatever so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we will refrain</font>

88
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,630
from doing so in the commute here and in

89
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,270
the community meetings but if you're

90
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,150
sure you're still work you're welcome to

91
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:01,570

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:10,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for example what is not a sexual</font>

129
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:00,660
this this project that is open for my

open source Manuel OS n that is

131
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:08,189
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> tha is the consist of the</font>

132
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,529
building an open source community around

133
00:09:08,189 --> 00:09:16,839
some seed projects where unity one of

134
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:20,050
them is our open<font color="#E5E5E5"> mono framework that we</font>

140
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,589
first open source and second<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm very</font>

141
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:45,309

apply this

believe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not the differences</font>

226
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,709
between Argentina and Spain are huge and

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,990
the differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> between Argentina and</font>

even larger so that requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

example these two multi things what is

00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,259
that about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-room it's</font>

232
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,019
difficult to mandate you are going to

233
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,389
use OpenStack and only open sack and a

234
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular version of OpenStack in all</font>

235
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:11,920
over or for footprint is well that gets

236
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:14,560
worse if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk with our customers etc</font>

237
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:18,899
so the idea is precisely to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

238
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,000
cover a wide variety of different bins a

239
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,339
multi-site by definition is that it will

294
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:04,459

295
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,159
you perform the configuration and how do

296
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,730
you attach the network functions with

297
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:14,089
your network all in place to for the

we believe that all right circle

319
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:13,850
service view doesn't make that much

320

sense thinking in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> view and this</font>

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,120
isn't it that we can discuss doesn't

322
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,679
make sure the mesons you say no I have a

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:25,820
the goal is the service not that not

that beautiful machine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

inform the service that you are doing

<font color="#CCCCCC">something in the virtual machine because</font>

330
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,899
that will affect in general function it

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,490
will affect the attachment point it will

332
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:37,010
affect at the end how you are

interacting with outside of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

335
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:43,100
decisions is something that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

be taking at the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> level next one</font>

337
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:48,379
please so that implies that we are

<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to change a little bit the</font>

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,070
are in there in the diagram so we want

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,380
to go a little bit to be jumpy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

346
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:12,019
on the other hand is that precisely the

347
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:16,309
idea is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at how is a</font>

cycle management are now split into

350
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:26,019
parts and it is to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> an evolution of</font>

351
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:29,299
this into moving moving this show you

352
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">achieve is that you can think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

353
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yo has a part of it has light</font>

354

cycle management as he as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DN event</font>

355
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:38,350
but you have and you have resource

356
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,879
orchestration in both parts why not

357
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,500
unify them in a single functional

358
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,260
components for sure that may

359
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is true that that implies that you</font>

360
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,430
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're using OS</font>

361
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,500
and you won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a subject that you</font>

362
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:56,010
can call this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NFL I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ply it</font>

363
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,710
and plug in something different but let

364
00:19:56,010 --> 00:20:01,620
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> insist we are trying to achieve fully</font>

365
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,900
functional environments that is much

366
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,449
more focused on function and not

367
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:11,040
necessarily on architecture that's one

368
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:12,690
place and again is a model driven

369
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,270
approach this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

370
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,030
you have had several times about when

371
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,639
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things like odl but</font>

372
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,290
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that you keep</font>

373
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,520
consistently using the same models of

374
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:34,110
development for for testing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

375
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:37,950
final deployments and and and service

376
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:41,760
provisioning and that implies that you

377
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:45,480
can support this also are so fashionable

378
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,180
things like dev ops and and continuous

379
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,360
integration and we are strongly

380
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,610
committed to contribute back to a

381
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,280
geography next one please trying to

382
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:58,320
accelerate a little bit this is a list

several slide on this one is when you

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,240
talk about the resort<font color="#E5E5E5"> orchestration what</font>

very important is the first one without

437
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,100
about going<font color="#E5E5E5"> for full services including</font>

438
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,470
what we call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks in areas that</font>

439
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,370
are the combination of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters</font>

that are associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vns and</font>

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,800
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is very important when it</font>

442
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,780
comes to the very much satirize about

that happened with current club

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:41,370
management's that you can simply not

afford this one place for the beam for

452
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,400
games like for example open sac and we

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,050
are strongly committed to vote and try

454
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,520
to contribute and to make OpenStack

455
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:05,280
evolve in that direction on the one hand

456
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,680
and the second is facilitated inventing

457

a direct integration work with OPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> fe so</font>

we are part of the air of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecosystem</font>

next one please so I'm Jack this is just

460
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,890
to finish we run a demo at the resident

februari is using<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell you is using a</font>

depending of their performance and

475
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,120
requirements and already a well it has

476
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:14,040
helped us a lot in identifying

477
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,080
limitations and potentially blue shoes

478
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,360
next one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last well</font>

479
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,850
these are you have there in that you

480
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,699
have there the couple of our videos on

the how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side what the demo</font>

was about on the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side if you</font>

the last one please this is simply last

one get ya this is simply has to

remember if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you are</font>

500
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,649
could imagine yes

attaboy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erickson I wonder if you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">considered hierarchies of the service</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the context you mentioned multiple</font>

505
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,928
sites and multiple beams so what the

506
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,619
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your view on this in the current</font>

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,440
the same day let's say in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roadmap or</font>

512
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,450
in the plan to go yes it will be

513
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:59,039
considered not in this demo you won't

514
00:26:51,450 --> 00:27:01,350
serious definitely a picture um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

next 20 minutes or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font>

522
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,129
experiences we've had while doing

523
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,919
performance tests with different

524
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:45,640
virtualization technologies ranging from

525
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:49,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">VMS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uni kernels tiny distributions of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">general purpose OSS and containers next</font>

527
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so in the beginning the vm</font>

528
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:58,030
king was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on charge of everything and</font>

529
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything is good that was the only</font>

530
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:05,820
game in town and then what happened was

531
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:08,080
we got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more options around</font>

532
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,730
virtualization for running<font color="#CCCCCC"> via naps and</font>

533
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,580
for other things as well one of them is

534
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:15,730
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are calling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux taina</font>

535
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,620
fication<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically taking a sort of</font>

536
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,440
stripped-down kernels and distributions

537
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:23,320
and building<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs around those click</font>

538
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,490
please along with that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something</font>

539
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,010
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique kernels which are</font>

540
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,679
specialized VMs on top of basically

541
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,510
minimalistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSS so not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

542
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">purpose sources like linux or freebsd</font>

543
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,669
but some sort of realistic ones and the

544
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,649
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> single application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

545
00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:42,160
will explain but these are more detail

546
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:44,799
later on quick and of course containers

547
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,600
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what happens is that the vm king</font>

548
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,379
is not happy anymore he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,709
game in town anymore but click the

550
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:56,080
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we in terms of</font>

551
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,820
performance and performance can be very

552
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,460
many different things so we took a

553
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,590
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different metrics one of them</font>

554
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how big is the virtual machine image</font>

555
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,699
size because it matters in terms of

556
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,760
shipping it out and lifecycle management

557
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,169
now memory consumption of course we have

558
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,020
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M creation time</font>

559
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,880
destruction time migration times we have

560
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,340
delay which is important it's only for

561
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">nfe and we have of course throughput</font>

562
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,980
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort of line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

563
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,230
sort of stretches between higher

564
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,540
overhead and lower overhead click we

565
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,280
probably have the standard vm towards

566
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:34,120
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of higher overhead range of</font>

567
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,250
things and then we have these tiny fight

568
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMs which are probably have lower</font>

569
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,360
overhead and then we have these

570
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,010
specialized VMs call

571
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Colonels and then all the way on the</font>

572
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we have containers right but the</font>

573
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,290
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know probably this is</font>

574
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:54,880
the order but how far right or how far

575
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,620
left are they next right so it could be

576
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that unique kernels are actually close</font>

577
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:02,169
to containers or not click or it could

578
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,750
be that unique kernels for some metrics

579
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,520
are ahead of containers or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

580
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:10,690
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is can we actually quantify</font>

581
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:13,179
some of this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I already mentioned the</font>

582
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,380
metrics I can give you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit so</font>

583
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:17,320
say a little bit about the methodology

584
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:20,110
so for vm imaging member consumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> via</font>

585
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,110
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools like LS top if we're on</font>

586
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,699
then we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> excel for the vm creation</font>

587
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:26,439
time what we do is we create the vm and

588
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we do a syn flood and then we</font>

589
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,900
measure when we get a reset for the way

590
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:34,750
to reset detection basically for

591
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:37,270
throughput we use iperf and modifies

592
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,980
versions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Viper because I perf will</font>

593
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,590
run on a Linux VM<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it'll run on</font>

594
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:44,230
containers ok but if you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

595
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,389
the minimalistic OS that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

596
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:48,220
API as Linux for instance so you need to

597
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,820
slightly modify I prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run on those</font>

598
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for RTT we just do it being flood now</font>

599
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,770
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the vm tests are run both on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Zen</font>

600
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:04,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">and kvm and we is a fairly standard not</font>

601
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:08,710
so expensive x86 server no problem we'll

602
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,570
get there eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so as I said</font>

603
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,520
on that timeline we had sort of four

604
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:15,280
points we have standard VMs for this we

605
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,168
use the debian based linux vm we have

606
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,840
these tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ems we use something</font>

607
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:22,240
called tiny-g's which is essentially a

608
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,649
sort of stripped-down linux kernel and a

609
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,530
very small district which is essentially

610
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,900
busy box and I perf and nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font>

611
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll give you more details about that</font>

612
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,370
for Ginny kernels on then we use mini OS

613
00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:34,720
as the minimalistic OS and we put

614
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,360
something called mini pearl on top which

615
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modified</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I perf basically and for</font>

616
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,959
kvm we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> osv as a mystical s and then</font>

617
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:46,480
I perf containers is darker click so now

618
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll speak a little bit more about so of</font>

619
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,800
course containers you're aware of Stan

620
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,210
events are aware of maybe these 25 years

621
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">in New kernels are a little bit more</font>

622
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,190
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a few things about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

623
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,700
for

624
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,259
tiny five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so a standard vm is</font>

625
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,970
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application on top of the district</font>

626
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,860
you have a lot of stuff different layers

627
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,259
at the colonel services libraries you

628
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,449
have a lot of elements quick but

629
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:08,919
ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> you only use a few of them in</font>

630
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want to run engines</font>

631
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,629
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a few libraries you use</font>

632
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:16,409
only a few kernel modules you use and

633
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:18,850
the rest is sort of just their Idol<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

634
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:20,799
so the idea under and this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

635
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,600
idea there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people working on</font>

636
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,210
what they call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next Anna fication</font>

637
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,029
especially from the abetted world is to

638
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:30,220
sort of take<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the charter bill the the</font>

639
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,809
smallest distress and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kernels possible</font>

640
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,460
while still keeping the Linux avi

641
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:38,168
because then you have compatibility with

642
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,970
applications and so what we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

643
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:41,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists tailor-made distribution and this</font>

644
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,710
is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> with endings but we we</font>

645
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:46,149
used one with iperf of course click and

646
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,779
just to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an idea this is what</font>

647
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:52,750
the PS command looks on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> time mix it</font>

648
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:55,659
looks busy but actually click most of

649
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,690
those are just<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kernel threads</font>

650
00:32:55,659 --> 00:33:00,399
and processes and click again it's only

651
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom part that's the user space</font>

652
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:06,070
stuff and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four in</font>

653
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,750
jenks threads you have an ssh server so

654
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,850
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in for convenience and</font>

655
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,710
and then you have a shell and nothing

656
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:15,039
more right so there's really nothing

657
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:19,059
much running on there ok click and click

658
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,090
again please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay click so that was the</font>

659
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:25,059
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> five vm unique kernels go ahead</font>

660
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">please once more okay so what's the Uni</font>

661
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:29,289
colonel it's a specialized vm so it's

662
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:32,470
normally a single application plus a

663
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:34,210
minimalistic OS these minimalistic OSS

664
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:36,820
generally have a single address space

665
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,860
cooperative scheduler so there's very

666
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,980
few overheads there's no context which

667
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,408
is no preemption things like that so and

668
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:48,580
of course well you know there's no

669
00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:51,549
extraneous code click so in a picture if

670
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a standard vm you have kernel</font>

671
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:54,129
space you have a bunch of drivers you

672
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:58,389
have user space with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ton of</font>

673
00:33:54,129 --> 00:34:00,100
applications on top click and then in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

674
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:01,750
in a unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colonel you just have a</font>

675
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,919
single application just a few drivers

676
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:10,060
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single memory address space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

677
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,918
so what about what we used so to do

678
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:14,290
benchmarking we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tag unique kernel</font>

679
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:18,279
that has just I prefer on top of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

680
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:20,889
on then click please the application is

681
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">iperf and it sits on top of mini OS and</font>

682
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:28,750
on kvm we have high perf and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> osv at</font>

683
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:31,480
the bottom and no<font color="#E5E5E5"> SV is just a open</font>

684
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,280
source minimalistic OS for not only for

685
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,639
kvm but originally for kvm yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

686
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">should know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are quite a few</font>

687
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:45,429
optimizations to zen and kvm when we run

688
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:47,710
our small<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs at uni kernels I don't</font>

689
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:49,810
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to go over those whereas the</font>

690
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,060
container numbers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just off the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shelf</font>

691
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:55,210
container numbers we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't gotten</font>

692
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:58,060
around to optimizing those<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so some</font>

693
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,640
of the results the first one image size

694
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,370
so how big are they these are the blue

695
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,470
bars so you can see it's in megabytes

696
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,089
and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom and the x axis</font>

697
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,709
you have all the different setups right

698
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,510
so from left to right you have the

699
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,540
standard vm Songz n and<font color="#CCCCCC"> k vm you have</font>

706
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,930
mini us are the smallest but containers

707
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:34,330
income and then you have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

708
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:38,500
timings is still pretty small 3.7<font color="#CCCCCC"> max</font>

709
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:42,069
and so forth so memory usage you can see

710
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:45,490
it's about containers unsurprisingly

711
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">wins 3.8 makes unique kernels are the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">next behind about amex and that's of</font>

713
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,300
course because containers a lot of the

714
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:56,200
memory usage and buffer us and so forth

715
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:01,150
is actually in the linux kernel boot

716
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,310
times this is a log scale we have again

717
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,960
this is unoptimized containers at 1.7

718
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,840
seconds and then we have time mix

719
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,550
beating that 400 milliseconds the

720
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,700
smallest ones are the unique kernels on

721
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:16,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zen 31 milliseconds but we can also get</font>

722
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:20,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">it down to under 10 milliseconds next</font>

723
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:22,609
see the containers win here so about

724
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,710
four milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> gimme kernels are not</font>

725
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:27,859
far behind five and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine milliseconds on</font>

726
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Zen and kvm and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tie nicks and</font>

727
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:32,480
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs not surprisingly some of</font>

728
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,550
the standard VMs have the same timings

729
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,070
because the kernel itself is basically

730
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:44,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same next throughput TX and rx</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

731
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:47,270
just really summarizing now we get we've

732
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:50,150
optimized TX on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zen so we get the</font>

733
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:52,759
highest throughput with the the mini

734
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">earth on them containers are not far</font>

735
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,650
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rx is sort of the same story ok</font>

736
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,410
so the conclusions is that basically

737
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">what people repeat is pms have really</font>

738
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:06,589
good isolation but our heavyweight so

739
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,319
you have to choose between either

740
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:11,839
containers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs depending on whether</font>

741
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,550
you want isolation or performance what

742
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,799
I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest with these numbers</font>

743
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,260
is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot more nuanced it's</font>

744
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,790
not such a clear winner one way or the

745
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:24,640
other depending on the metrics and

746
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:28,250
depending what you mean by a vm right so

747
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,348
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take away message is you</font>

748
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,240
know if you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you thought this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was sort</font>

749
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,790
of clear and easy it's it's actually not

750
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,459
things like universal kernels and sort

751
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:41,020
of tiny<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 EMS provide you with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

752
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:45,710
points in that timeline that make it so

753
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:47,480
that they may be a viable alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

754
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,240
containers instead multi-tenant

755
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,910
deployments were isolation is is a must

756
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:57,020
at least until isolation and containers

757
00:37:52,910 --> 00:38:00,560
catches up the last one yeah the vm king

758
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,550
is sort of happy again last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this but this is</font>

761
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:10,310
that we could do towards this containers

draft thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really be no</font>

763
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:17,000
wait we have them there from for a while

764
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,710
so please so when you were using<font color="#CCCCCC"> khan</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doctor she said containers you're</font>

00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,940
probably using alexs if you try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

767
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:25,760
see groups with Dockers or you were just

768
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,250
focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> alex's it was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lexi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we</font>

769
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,890
didn't do that

770
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,960
yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't we haven't looked at</font>

771
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,960
optimizing containers because we just

772
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,790
haven't gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so you may say</font>

773
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,080
this is somewhat unfair comparison

774
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,300
because you've optimized the heck out of

775
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zen kvm and unique kernels and you've</font>

776
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,250
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking vanilla containers and</font>

777
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,930
that's a fair enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment you should</font>

778
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,030
take away orders of magnitude

779
00:38:46,930 --> 00:39:08,710
comparisons out of this rather than the

780
00:38:49,030 --> 00:39:11,560
actual numbers very good sure so very

781
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:13,720
nice work so one of the things we have

782
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,540
an active track theory of containers of

783
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,910
course we are actually right now more

784
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,710
investigating the issues and what you're

785
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,350
finding is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the security</font>

786
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:25,420
implications is kind of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

787
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,670
biggest blockers to contain their

788
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,530
adoption besides the other issues around

789
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:33,150
you know be end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being offenders</font>

790
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:35,680
moving slow and also the OS support so

791
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your take on the security front</font>

792
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,270
have you done any benchmarking work

793
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:44,740
there so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> winning my benchmarking</font>

794
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:47,440
of security um so in essence<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say so</font>

795
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PM's by nature and</font>

796
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,380
securit when you go to the Container

797
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:55,240
landscape say through see groups and all

798
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:58,510
the situation we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> add those</font>

799
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,160
additional security hooks how will that

800
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:02,650
impact the performance that's what I

801
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">meant so basically you know anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

802
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,880
add to make the container deployment

803
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,319
more secure then how does start

804
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,930
comparing on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance yeah I</font>

805
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know why I haven't we're not</font>

806
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,580
security guys were sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems and</font>

807
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,110
performance guys I guess it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

808
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,660
possible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to benchmark different</font>

809
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,850
versions of containers with and without

810
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">different security options but now we</font>

811
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done that yet thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

812
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,170
thanks

813
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:37,130
okay yes now now we have they even let

814
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,129
me let me open it

816
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so want to talk about</font>

817
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:05,710
performance high performance nfe give

818
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,060
you a bit of background of where we're

819
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,089
coming from is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've actually been</font>

820
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,299
using building our network appliances

821
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:15,940
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a commodity office commercial</font>

823
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,310
14 years now inside our appliances we've

824
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,280
been achieving horizontal scale using

825
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,779
load balancing techniques and something

826
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:31,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cheney</font>

827
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:34,599
and recently we demonstrated what one

828
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:37,799
terabit per second in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten rack units of</font>

00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:45,280
in conjunction with with Dell and Intel

831
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:48,098
so next slide please I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how</font>

832
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,480
to get information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that later so the</font>

00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:52,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we're coming at this is we're</font>

834
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at being you know transparent</font>

835
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:57,759
middle box think of it like a bump in

00:41:54,550 --> 00:42:00,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire possibly multiple wires in</font>

837
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,910
which the traffic is being routed in a

838
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:07,480
symmetrical manner I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit more</font>

839
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:11,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that later too so some of the</font>

840
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:13,329
goals these should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty not</font>

841
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,869
contentious I think you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

842
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:19,630
say how do we really minimize latency

843
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:22,510
really get the best possible gigabits

844
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:24,550
per second per watt and gigabits per

845
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,319
second per rack unit while using

846
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:31,390
commercial off-the-shelf hardware next

847
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:33,970
Lisa okay first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all talk about how to</font>

848
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,790
make a fast component so just one of the

849
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:39,430
service functions so the good news is

850
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:41,730
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know simple tasks before</font>

851
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:45,040
wording counting a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things a</font>

852
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:47,230
software it really can keep up with line

853
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,670
rates with<font color="#CCCCCC"> interessant interface rates</font>

854
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:53,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know others have reported this to</font>

855
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,349
I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these four points</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as to</font>

856
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,270
why these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are important you know one of</font>

857
00:42:56,349 --> 00:43:00,160
them is to think about breaking your

858
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:03,250
jobs down into multiple independent

859
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,339
threads locking those threads to

860
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,230
physical

861
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:11,160
where they get the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> chord of</font>

00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,720

techniques of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero copy forwarding next</font>

867
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:32,730
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm oh no you're wasting my time</font>

868
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:36,540
yeah okay one second okay so first point

869
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">II</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have these multi-core</font>

870
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:42,420
processors you know the newer processors

871
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:45,839
all have multiple course we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

872
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,059
best way to utilize these is to have

873
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,109
multiple independent threads that share

874
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:54,210
nothing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that you know any use</font>

875
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:58,529
of semaphores between threads even if

876
00:43:54,210 --> 00:44:01,319
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> contested are they really</font>

877
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:04,079
cut down on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory bandwidth so our</font>

878
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,480
approach is slice up the network data so

879
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:11,460
that each thread can work independently

880
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:13,440
on on its chunk of data so if you're an

881
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet service provider a natural way</font>

882
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,200
to slice this is to put individual

883
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,939
subscribers traffic on different

884
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:24,390
processors and not have to have any

885
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">crosstalk between these other approaches</font>

886
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,740
are just if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

887
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:30,390
subscribers think about using IP address

888
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,729
hashing or something like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

890
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,359
different kind of approaches you can

891
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,910
take one approaches you know a

892
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:41,660
lightweight thread in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> process or you</font>

893
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:44,730
can have independent processes or even

894
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:48,710
individual machines they're different

895
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways of breaking it down next please</font>

896
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we found it also important to</font>

897
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:00,809
assign these threads to really lock them

898
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,750
down to the cores that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're allowed</font>

899
00:45:00,809 --> 00:45:05,730
to use so in a virtual environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

901
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,970

dedicate the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware course to</font>

903
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:16,348
specific virtual machines and then

904
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,380
within the virtual machines you have to

905
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:20,830
lock your threads

906
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,460
to specific course if you've given your

907

virtual machine more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> core you</font>

908
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,120
know and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

909
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,930
the benefit of caching instruction

910
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,770
caching and data caching and also the

911
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:37,839
the packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want them to arrive in</font>

to the right core and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one else other</font>

913
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,120
thing worth pointing out is on some of

914
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:46,390
these some of these blades for example

915
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,100
that have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs on them not all</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs are connected to the hardware</font>

917
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:54,009
in exactly the same way that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Numa</font>

919
00:45:54,010 --> 00:46:00,910

920
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,940
different processors so you know we

921
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:06,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that some times you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one of</font>

922
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,680
the cpu sockets will be connected to the

00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,980
one is not so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually more</font>

925

00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,910
other cpu so you may if your application

00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">has fast path and a control plane you</font>

928
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:23,980
may choose what the fast pass on the one

929
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:28,149
that's closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interfaces next</font>

930
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:30,340
please another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we found very</font>

931
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,780
important is to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the physical</font>

932
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:37,500

00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:40,090
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone may not know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

934
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:43,300
physical function pass through in a

935
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:45,910
nutshell is when you give the device

936
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:48,310
driver you give the actual device

937
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,529
hardware to the virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine it owns</font>

938
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:55,000
it and it disappears from the operating

939
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:59,830
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the host</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> iov is a</font>

940
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:03,220
technology in which the hardware take

941
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:05,950
one physical interface give it multiple

942
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:09,339
MAC<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses and the hardware sorts the</font>

943
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:11,970
packets into different queues for each

944
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:14,500
each of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> threads so you can attach</font>

945
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,640
and so now the hardware is sorting the

946
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,200
packets for you and you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

947
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,060
piece of software to sit there between

948
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,870
the physical function and the virtual

949
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:27,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've explained that now</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my tips for within</font>

951
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">one virtual machine now how do how does</font>

952
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:37,630
Gail out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

953
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:39,920
what we call a symmetrical traffic and

954
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,870
the reason I'm going down this road is

955
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,640
because some service functions

956
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:47,270
particularly transparent service

957
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:52,190
functions want to see all traffic of a

958
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:54,259
flow in both directions you know think

959
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know a firewall it sees a</font>

960
00:47:54,260 --> 00:48:00,110
typically you say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow a flow</font>

961
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,640
in if I saw the syn packet out and then

962
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,960
I met<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow the traffic then if you're</font>

963
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,569
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the incoming traffic you</font>

964
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,890
can't make the right decision anyway but

965
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:11,630
as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in in the internet packets</font>

966
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,129
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple routes they can take</font>

967
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiple lengths so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bring</font>

968
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:22,190
those together for processing so next

969
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:25,640
slide please so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a typical way we</font>

970
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:28,510
put together a solution the device is on

971
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:33,740
the left those would be your

972
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:36,230
intersecting a link so these would be

973
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,810
like transparently you want to make a

974
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:41,600
bump in the wire view there so the

975
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:45,049
traffic coming in say on the top one the

976
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:48,319
red path traffic comes to a device and

977
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:50,110
I'm showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like a service function</font>

978
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:53,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cheney now where we hit a classifier</font>

979
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:55,880
choose a virtual machine to send a

981
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,800
returns the traffic to the link it's

00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,630
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out I can have another</font>

path with traffic in the opposite

985
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:12,290
direction being sent to the same virtual

986
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:14,990
machine because it's the same subscriber

987
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:17,870
or it's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and</font>

988
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:19,729
we call this you know you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

989
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:21,560
it as there's two things going on here

990
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:23,570
there's a load balancing we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

991
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:27,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use of all the virtual machines in</font>

992
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:30,200
a fair way and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're consistently</font>

993
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,440
removing the asymmetrical traffic next

994
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,419
slide please so something also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

995
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,430
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the east-west</font>

996
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,260
bottleneck you know the more virtual

997
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:42,319
mission every time the traffic goes in

998
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,680
and out of a virtual machine under the

999
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,170
switch fabric

1000
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,118
you've you're using up interface

1001
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:50,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">bandwidth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

1002
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,990
because the software generally can keep

1003
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:57,150
up with the interface rates you're

1004
00:49:53,990 --> 00:50:01,950
really become bottleneck on on the

1005
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:03,900
bandwidth we also point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as you</font>

1006
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:07,618
encapsulate traffic you make the traffic

1007
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:11,700
bigger and it traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes in on a</font>

1008
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:13,200
link can't go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> when it goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1009
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:19,308
service function it actually takes more

1010
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:22,348
bandwidth then comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> than it initially</font>

1011
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:23,730
so maybe this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious but if</font>

1012
00:50:22,349 --> 00:50:25,500
you have a to touch solution if your

1013
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,720
packet goes to two machines you really

1014
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,640
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> twice the gear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> love one touch</font>

1015
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,189
solution so you really that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font>

1016
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess for the functions themselves but</font>

1017
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:36,750
if you're adding<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra components to</font>

1018
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:39,510
just you know touch the traffic to

1019
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:43,380
forward it it becomes an extra cost ok

1020
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:46,859
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so one of my suggestions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1021

<font color="#E5E5E5">the service function chaining everyone</font>

1022
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:50,910
here may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be familiar with it but</font>

1023
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,710
there's a service function forwarder sff

1024
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:56,118
and there's a service function these are

1025
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:59,730
identified as architectural components

1026
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:03,000
we think it's really a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

1027
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,950
them in the same thread so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

1028
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,260
their architectural e are distinct

1029
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:11,279
components we<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest putting them</font>

1030
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:13,829
together because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you have a</font>

1031
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,230
separate software component to do the

1032
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:17,760
service function forwarding you're

1033
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,859
dedicating at least the core to do the

1034
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,500
forwarding or interface you're adding

1035
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:24,270
extra latency extra queuing and it's

1036
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,280
also if it's on a different device it's

1037
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:31,559
consuming your east-west budget next

1038
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">please so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a service chaining one</font>

1039
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,299
service chain which we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font>

1040
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:39,839
one packet through two functions with

1041
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:43,049
the service function forwarder inside

1042
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:45,359
the function itself so you know packet

1043
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:46,920
can come in be classified choose a

1044
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,490
virtual machine the virtual machine

1045
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:53,609
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sff function it</font>

1046
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:55,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay five minutes okay it can be</font>

1047
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:57,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">forwarded to the next virtual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

1048
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:01,020
and then it can be forward

1049
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:03,529
the final hop whereas next slide if

1050
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:08,040
there's an external forwarding function

1051
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:11,310
you know it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SF to</font>

1053
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:16,140
right that function on the bottom is

1054
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:20,279
really every packets going in and out

1055
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:25,740
twice and its really cheering<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a lot</font>

00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:27,359
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface bandwidth next this so my</font>

1057
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:30,660
point about the to minimize

1058
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,940
encapsulation overhead you know it's not

1059
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:35,098
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an MTU question to us because we</font>

1062
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:41,009
time you encapsulate you make the packet

1063
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,500
bigger is reducing the effective

1064
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:47,220
bandwidth because your packets are

1065

1070
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you we would choose direct encapsulation</font>

1071
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,480
on top of the ethernet so we would take

1072

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac followed immediately upon it and</font>

1073

it's a cheddar went on the same layer to

1074
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,650
segment we would resort to using an IP

1075
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,980
encapsulation only if the devices were

1076

separated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP network and they're</font>

1081
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,509
was reflecting I think of almost at the

1082
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,190
end I was reflecting on the question

1083
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:38,760
everyone asks is you okay so how many

1084
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:42,119
VMS do i do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> neat and unfortunately the</font>

1085
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,069
answer right now is you it depends if

1086
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,460
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you hint from you know</font>

1087
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:50,609
all the the things I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1088
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,790
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how is the application</font>

1089
00:53:50,609 --> 00:53:57,690
written that were different<font color="#E5E5E5"> threads used</font>

1090
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:59,190
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much memory bandwidth is used you</font>

1091
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,500
know the characteristics the application

1092
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:04,140
itself what kind of technology i'm

1093
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,819
running on is the application written in

1094
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,868
a way that's compatible with the kind of

1095
00:54:05,819 --> 00:54:11,130
architecture running on the application

1096

1098
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:21,690
does your infrastructure support that am

1103
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,150
hard part comes in thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1104
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,610

your solution and is your switching and

1107
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,350

questions thank you can we ask before I

1133
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:04,650
he's getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the mind so</font>

1134
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,530
essentially what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're proposing is</font>

1135
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,570
sorry I what you're proposing is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sff</font>

1136
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:12,450
being observed with a service function

1137
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,910
that means if you know you need overlays

1138
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:16,410
then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there as</font>

1139
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:19,049
part of the service function itself very

1140
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,379
instantiating overlay is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair</font>

1141
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:21,380
assumption

1142
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:26,510
the tone of it soon it's an overlay it's

1143
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:28,310
the same way and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially it</font>

1144
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:30,349
depends in the diplomatic you are doing

1145
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:35,119
SF of this have you see any function but

1146
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:37,609
if you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a overlay then you consider</font>

1147
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,349
that happening separately or still

1148
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:41,359
bottom you know what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing yeah I</font>

1149
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:42,980
didn't think about that but yeah I think

1150
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,098
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about over ladies there</font>

1151
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:50,000
as well so if you can remove you know an

1152
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:52,609
extra thread it's only job is to say

1153
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">encapsulated and do next hop I think</font>

1154
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:57,259
that's a good performance choice now it

1155
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,640
may become or maybe you may want to

1156
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,580
trade that<font color="#CCCCCC"> off with four other</font>

1157
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,259
objectives but from purely performance

1158
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:07,069
point of view I think that's what my

1159
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:10,220
point if I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving these deployments</font>

1160
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,750
that they're everywhere anything if that

1161
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:15,490
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gel those</font>

1162
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:15,490
together then you don't get off you

1163
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:24,560
should so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant was so easy if I</font>

1164
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:31,330
mean nothing move oh you unplugged it

1165
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:34,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what I meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was essentially um</font>

1166
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,348
from what is seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> under slower laser</font>

1167
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:38,420
combined with such an idea I mean it

1168
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:41,599
doesn't get the full deployment benefit

1169
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all I mean overlays are very very</font>

1170
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,800
progressive to me yeah so cool thank you

1171
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:50,750
just in case any any any one else wanted

1172
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a question we are crossing the</font>

1173
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:54,619
line so I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to</font>

1174
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,450
be quick so the first one is a

1175
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:58,940
clarification question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use among it</font>

1176
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:02,930
will make you identified yourself about

1177
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:06,050
you let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that your friend jose</font>

1178
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:08,060
aldo we see first a very quick

1179
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:10,820
clarification question is it kvm and

1180
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:14,330
open we switch what are you using as the

1181
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:17,359
technologies uh if I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1182
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:19,160
latest kvm yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and and the second</font>

1183
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is he we've been doing a performance</font>

1184
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,118
optimization for a fee for a while and

1185
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:24,290
performance measurements so a lot of the

1186
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,970
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch the phone they're</font>

1187
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:28,160
certainly tricky another one that's even

1188
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:30,529
worse is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the nav functions</font>

1189
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,259
are dependent how expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are is</font>

1190
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,070
completely dependent on the traffic

1191
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,870
matrix ending but

1192
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,850
in the traffic i'm thinking DPI's and

1193
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:41,270
things like that how do you cope<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1194
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:44,569
those yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1195
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:46,670
in in our report I think we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trap</font>

1196
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:48,020
we call the internet traffic mix which

1197
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:51,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sampling of all different</font>

1198
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of traffic two together so okay</font>

1199
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,520
and what's the second i agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you</font>

1200
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,109
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that's probably something</font>

1201
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,270
else<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in my it depends</font>

1202
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">light is the type of traffic that you're</font>

1203
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:04,070
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ok this is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the kind</font>

1204
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,799
of thing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question i would love</font>

1205
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:10,030
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see in the list please I mean this is</font>

1206
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:13,820
it if you if you have some particular

1207
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:15,680
patterns 20 to 22 value ideals and this

1208
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:18,080
is the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that would help us</font>

1209
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:21,919
in making evolve this and make a real

1210
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:26,540
contribution now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry about this no</font>

1211
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:29,270
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> then dan McGann which more and</font>

1212
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,860
more especially the center operators are

1213
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:33,800
complaining about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power</font>

1214
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,060
consumption at the heat dissipation when

1215
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,340
you're a Teen you're looking into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1216
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:40,009
performance are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in any of</font>

1217
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:41,600
those you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the power cost</font>

1218
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,760
per bit you know and the heat

1219
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,339
dissipation cost per bit because this is

1220
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,230
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> some in those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tamara dynamics are</font>

1221
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:50,570
giving them more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more headache yeah</font>

1222
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:52,730
as our you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is one of my second</font>

1223
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:54,290
criteria if you go to a report you can

1224
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:57,110
get the exact numbers that we talked

1225
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:58,730
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talked about watts per gigabyte</font>

1226
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,360
or gigabits per watt I can remember

1227
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:06,380
which it was we found it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font>

1228
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:08,330
bit more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour and in appliance then</font>

1229
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:12,980
you can angry see some comparisons are

1230
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:14,690
made good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah the last</font>

1231
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">fear that the last one should be very</font>

1232
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:22,010
pretty quick because ronke<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked it</font>

1233
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:28,130
explicitly to be to make it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font>

1234
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:30,800
so you do go<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah I just um go to the</font>

1235
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:35,150
next slide please<font color="#CCCCCC"> fade away yeah thank</font>

1236
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so when you started off n fer g one</font>

1237
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:40,940
of the key goals was I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

1238
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,830
drugs and ideas but influence ray how to

1239
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:45,650
influence real implementations happening

1240
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:47,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the third you would we wanted to</font>

1241
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,869
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a direct impact</font>

1242
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:51,299
opens the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most relevant open source</font>

1243
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:54,599
projects which include OpenStack open

1244
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:57,390
daylight and OPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fe and the dad</font>

1245
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:59,220
essentially what we did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all we</font>

1246
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:01,890
saw that the policy based resource

1247
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:04,259
management work item has had the maximum

1248
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:07,460
interest in a community you know I think

1249
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:10,049
10<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus in fact close to 15 drafts and</font>

1250
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,210
in fact specifically on the resource

1251
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:14,788
management anglica policy is something

1252
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:17,279
we've been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the NF ERG team</font>

1253
01:01:14,789 --> 01:01:20,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the OpenStack community for</font>

1254
01:01:17,279 --> 01:01:24,779
almost last four months refining<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1255
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:27,779
proposal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the output of it is I'd</font>

1256
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to call as policy-driven platform</font>

1257
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:33,119
of our scheduler essentially if you look

1258
01:01:30,479 --> 01:01:35,098
at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the OpenStack scheduling</font>

1259
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,749
framework and you know several

1260
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:38,549
presenters<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1261
01:01:36,749 --> 01:01:40,649
platform awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a go talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1262
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave talked about it I mean</font>

1263
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:45,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically it sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all those and</font>

1264
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:48,630
hardware acceleration how do you bring

1265
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:50,700
down bring them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> board so some of the</font>

1266
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:52,619
key problems we see with the current

1267
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,078
OpenStack scheduling framework or that

1268
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,489
framework is not extensible I mean if

1269
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:58,710
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a new feature you have</font>

1270
01:01:56,489 --> 01:02:01,759
to wait six months right basically you

1271
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:04,829
know next OpenStack release and also

1272
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:06,930
when it comes to usability and in terms

1273
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:08,640
of you know whether you made the right

1274
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:11,308
placement decision how you actually

1275
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,729
verify whether things happen even<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1276
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:16,680
there is a gap and also the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

1277
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:18,808
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see is like you know lack of</font>

1278
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,089
a single representation for monitoring

1279
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:23,549
and placement that means essentially you

1280
01:02:21,089 --> 01:02:25,650
know when resource utilization changes

1281
01:02:23,549 --> 01:02:27,180
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go verify and see whether</font>

1282
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:29,339
you know there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the right</font>

1283
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:31,649
placement or it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something else</font>

1284
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:33,869
so these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key areas</font>

1285
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,849
you're addressing to the spec and I

1286
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:37,890
think the best part about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1287
01:02:35,849 --> 01:02:39,450
essentially the featured velocity that

1288
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:42,359
means this is headed in the DevOps

1289
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:45,210

01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:47,369
introduce new features you know I'd

<font color="#E5E5E5">DevOps pace in the order of beings and</font>

1292
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:52,019
not wait for OpenStack release and there

1293
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:53,640
is a detailed spec which is under review

1294
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:55,348
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to open follow the</font>

1295
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:57,538
OpenStack community process is pretty

1296
01:02:55,349 --> 01:03:00,029
intense and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of somewhere</font>

1297
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:00,880
between use cases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a strong</font>

developer in

1299
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,730
fluence based on the current code base

1300
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:07,990
and what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done cannot be done and</font>

1301
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:10,240
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a big presentation of the</font>

01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:12,490
upcoming OpenStack summit<font color="#CCCCCC"> but will not</font>

1303
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,589
just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use cases the</font>

1304
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:17,008
current problems taste and also the

1305
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:21,220
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perhaps some you know</font>

1306
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:23,170
implementation details and last but not

1307
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,299
least I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that the goal</font>

1308
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,740
of this is not just producing but also

1309
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:30,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">who is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the consumer that we</font>

01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:32,680
owe a sm you know and you know tacker

1314
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,539
because the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are defining the</font>

01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:45,579
northbound API is through OpenStack heat
