good afternoon it started we only have

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our slogan epic a fallen angel</font>

3
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,020
this is the think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

4
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:33,850
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important slide</font>

5
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,429
you use the no-fly din if they'd said

6
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:42,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposed research group and this is our</font>

9
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:54,850
where it applies so in particular please

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,520
have a look at the IP on guidelines of

11
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:02,470
the a RTF which<font color="#CCCCCC"> are essentially</font>

12
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">identical to those of the IETF there's a</font>

16
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:21,489
up atop repositories for our meeting so

17
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,798
if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the agenda for</font>

full we this is the summary meeting so

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,930
we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to really do work here</font>

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,910
at this meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hour but of</font>

24
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we are very interested in getting</font>

25
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:50,470
feedback from people who have not being

26
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of your process so far so I will</font>

27
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,480
talk a couple of minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

28
00:02:53,019 --> 00:03:00,090
status of the research group then re

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">will talk about one of our deliverables</font>

one of other deliverables a secure boot

32
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:14,380
strapping the survey document then maybe

33
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,560
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the outreach and</font>

34
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:21,329
cooperation with other organizations

35
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,209
briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> materials will have a short talk</font>

36
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,800
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction models and hypermedia</font>

37
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:28,780
controls

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,810
then we can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short discussion</font>

39
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,570
about what we might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the</font>

40
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">area of schema interoperability and at</font>

41
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:43,900
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can look at future meetings</font>

42
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:47,320
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> researcher um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's just</font>

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,330
start with overview over the research

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:56,019
group the researcher was relatively new

45
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:59,440
so i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say what it is about it</font>

46
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:02,500
is about making the Internet of Things a

47
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:07,710
reality Internet of Things the term that

48
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:10,570
is used for many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas not</font>

49
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,740
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which actually contain an</font>

50
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:16,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet and what why is Internet</font>

51
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,400
technology not used more for the

52
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,229
Internet of Things there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

53
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,219
stumbling blocks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to work</font>

54
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,760
on those this is really the idea find

55
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:31,630
out where those some big blocks are and

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:35,560
maybe find ways of hearing and in

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular those ways that might lead to</font>

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,770
IETF standardization and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

59
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,900
there are so many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that belong to</font>

60
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,849
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet of Things for instance</font>

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">people belong from the internet of</font>

62
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:52,000
things but we are mostly looking at the

63
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,719
layers from the Edit area adaptation

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,180
layer up through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application layer</font>

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:07,390
and that includes management and

66
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:11,410
security what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far we</font>

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:15,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a number of meetings before we</font>

68
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,680
were officially chartered and those who

69
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:21,760
are co-located with IETF meetings but

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,740
also co-located with w3c meetings w3c

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,730
has an interest group called web of

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,790
things so they are looking at using web

73
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:34,030
architecture for Internet of Things

74
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:37,330
applications and it turned out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

75
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,880
extremely useful to co-locate with them

76
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,550
and have joined discussions

77
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,159
and right after we were chartered we had

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:51,990
another one of those commonly dings with

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:55,990
w3c<font color="#E5E5E5"> and knees and in later in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tennessee</font>

80
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,960
we had a short meeting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was located</font>

81
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an IED workshop about semantic</font>

82
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,799
interoperability we have three documents

83
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,140
that we have designated at it as

84
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,900
deliverables right now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

85
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,500
progress in various stages we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

86
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:18,130
about two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these today one is only</font>

87
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,780
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now being started being worked on</font>

88
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,110
the other ones I already talked about

89
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:27,960
rest and secure boot strapping survey

90
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:32,110
and finally last but certainly not least

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,630
what we have done is outreach to other

92
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,270
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for instance in</font>

93
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,840
Tennessee we have met with Bluetooth

94
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:45,510
people and we had a joint meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:53,340
ocf the open connectivity forum and

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:55,630
foundation I'm sorry and with w3c so we

97
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:01,299
could start to understand what those

98
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:03,520
various organizations are doing um maybe

99
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,790
a quick peek into what we will be doing

100
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,210
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the work that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

101
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:14,680
described continues we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

102
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:17,919
having meetings at real academic

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:22,420
research menus we kind of have neglected

104
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,270
this in the first year because there was

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,030
so much cooperation with other standards

106
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:30,849
organizations that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary to be</font>

107
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this space but</font>

108
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,240
that's certainly on the list and we also

109
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,120
want to co-locate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source</font>

110
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,060
activities and there we will have an

111
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,230
opportunity in a balloon right in front

112
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:51,460
of the next ITF there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a summer</font>

116
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:05,060
open source community and finally why we

117
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,800
already have worked on benchmark and

118
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,650
reference scenario see we plan to

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">formalize this work a little bit more</font>

120
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,739
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a fourth deliver document</font>

it's also in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berlin so then then whether</font>

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,440
the ITF can go there but also people who

come for the right summit you can go I

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this tub pre-much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

146
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,480
year or so and that goal of the document

147
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,670
is that they give guidance for designing

148
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">iot systems that follow the rest</font>

149
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,560
architectural style and as you know

150
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,020
those restful systems that you see out

151
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,760
there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always all of them</font>

152
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,240
use lot of technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been</font>

153
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:57,830
developed at IETF however sometimes use

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,870
is innovative at least and sometimes are

155
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,930
violating even many of the basic

156
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,430
principles still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the RFC's so the</font>

157
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea would be to collect some of these</font>

158
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,020
guidance across various sources RFC's

159
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,360
etc who didn't want document that you

160
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,370
could be able to easily to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
who is designing his<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems designing</font>

162
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,370
api's design services and they could at

163
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,199
least get the basic rights also the idea

164
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,230
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect terminology there so we</font>

165
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,210
have a common language<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussing</font>

166
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,640
discussing these things and have really

167
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:31,370
key piece of information and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointers</font>

168
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,819
for details so this government is either

169
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:38,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short it's really focus</font>

170
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:40,070
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ilt have a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples the quick and</font>

171
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,080
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read and then you have a lot of</font>

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:48,260
pointers wait and find find more

173
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:51,080
information so where are we know we have

174
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second version out about a month ago</font>

175
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,400
now we got a lot of feedback on the

176
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,050
previous person it was presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,170
example in the web of things group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

178
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:04,160
represented in that article also shared

179
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,990
with some other organizations so we

180
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
added there quite a bit more technology

181
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,380
was there were some terms for the

182
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,530
leasing and somewhere maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. thought</font>

183
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:15,260
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in particular to</font>

184
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,449
move issues around I'd impotency an

185
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,000
application state but<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to be</font>

186
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:24,230
confusing this faith they were clarified

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,880
also also<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the trap and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

188
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,580
questions so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

189
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,040
difference when it comes to iop in a

190
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,410
restful system and really there isn't

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,699
quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> moves differences there but</font>

192
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,589
there are few key differences for

193
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,900
example in data formats that you may

194
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,800
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more compact data formats</font>

195
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,300
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> machine-readable</font>

196
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,969
compared to human readable and some of

197
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,729
the interaction patterns are often

198
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,460
different when it comes the scenarios

199
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,950
converted their other<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest consistency</font>

200
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,020
so those three issues were<font color="#E5E5E5"> make perfect</font>

201
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,780
case the current person but we still

202
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,780
have at least three key topics that you

203
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,939
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss war ii</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straps one is</font>

204
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,520
resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediate back design so how do</font>

205
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,100
you go about designing your problem in

206
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,340
our kinetic as resources as media types

207
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,920
of interactions and also hypermedia

208
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">different applications so how do you</font>

209
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,640
think's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forties etc really design</font>

210
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,950
your application

211
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,220
mattias will be discussing that perfect

212
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,900
more and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will aiming to have</font>

213
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,450
their some design patterns so there are

214
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">course common problems that we occur</font>

215
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,220
where you're doing such systems and

216
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,829
locate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple ways of solving those</font>

217
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:42,800
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> proven useful in various</font>

218
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:44,870
contexts so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm putting this way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,060
short to short slow to actually discuss

220
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,820
it if it's open issues but I recommend

221
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,449
you all Rita crap reviews<font color="#CCCCCC"> and comments</font>

222
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,290
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> few so are very welcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

223
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,700
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

224
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,270
from you guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also from</font>

225
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,000
organizations that you are working

226
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,030
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IEP so a lot of these</font>

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are like well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> water idea that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

228
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out certified in other organizations</font>

229
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,060
some of these principles are not that

230
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known also if you can discuss this</font>

231
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">document see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's why that's what</font>

232
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,510
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do make sense right now and also</font>

233
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,280
getting back information what else is

234
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,720
that you're struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what are the</font>

235
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,829
key questions you would like to have

236
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">more clarification and let this go PL</font>

237
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,210
nobility part of me also other

238
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:34,900
organizations here aware of the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

239
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:37,700
ready great woman and ferghal<font color="#E5E5E5"> on thanks</font>

240
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,120
yes we have immediate work<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

241
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,250
comments and questions quick comment as

242
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,940
terminology in our struggle way that the

243
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">definition of rest is that our state is</font>

244
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,940
maintained in the client and not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

245
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:55,040
server but in some I'll team partners

246
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,830
highly constrained environments stays

247
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,420
became the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server's world the fight with</font>

248
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,880
they actually minimum data transfer so

249
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">run stuff is basically flying the face</font>

250
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,630
if you say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be restful</font>

251
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,840
and Yuri look at that distressful it's

252
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:13,400
that restful so our week is kind of

253
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,210
fuzzing the words around here or we're

254
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:21,800
saying that these systems just are not

255
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:23,960
restful I guess I will defer that

256
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,500
question Mattias who's our expert<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

257
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,620
this topic yeah we had a discussion on

258
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,780
this during one of our coats anyway so

259
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,700
so usually the way is in breast

260
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,140
yeah that's resource stated on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

261
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,200
server side that can also be modified

262
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,660
and it also is part of the overall state

263
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,860
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our application so</font>

264
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,050
pensive I had a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

265
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,660
application state definition because

266
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,310
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's it been climbed if</font>

267
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have people who don't didn't read</font>

268
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,609
this think the application state should

269
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,770
be the whole thing so what's on the time

270
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,220
and also what I changed on the server so

271
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes so we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure should</font>

272
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,230
we stick to this but it's written in the

273
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,030
thesis or should we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

274
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">is common language right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so and</font>

275
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,770
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of development recently</font>

276
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:12,050
and we haven't gotten enough feedback

277
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,329
actually which way we should go so

278
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,729
apparently you recommend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with what</font>

279
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">people or the language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people use right</font>

280
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,430
now and use this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I see a not</font>

281
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,290
your I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good input yeah and</font>

282
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,329
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I recommend so we have now</font>

283
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,130
one definition of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

284
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,660
a state<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in the draft but that is</font>

285
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,330
really we've been going back and forth

286
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,430
on what do we think is right way to go

287
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,530
and as muddy as are saying more more

288
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,189
impetus more than welcome so above

289
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,990
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone else too um yeah I</font>

290
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">was actually I'm getting to the mic to</font>

291
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this day like it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to</font>

292
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:49,300
define<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you mean by breast and I</font>

293
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,610
think the comment that fortress made a

294
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,849
sort of reflected that at that India if

295
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:58,460
you have it already than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up.get</font>

296
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,440
of thing I'm sort of put a basic

297
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,720
communication are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything is</font>

298
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,300
fine and everything is is a pretty

299
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,940
uncontroversial<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think but then there</font>

300
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,319
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these other aspect that we stumbled</font>

301
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,960
them upon which was topics like you

302
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,390
trigger an action and the result doesn't

303
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,110
come back immediately instead of things

304
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:23,000
did you do this custom in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

305
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,200
the events are not really discussed yet

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,740
that's one of the things we've been

307
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,430
planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add more text about so</font>

308
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,460
unfortunately guess we're already over

309
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,469
time so we can't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monte's everybody</font>

310
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,670
now that's really important yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

311
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,740
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes that's something what we</font>

312
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,930
have on the agenda on to these events

313
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,820
and interaction models to have more

314
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,880
discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's look there</font>

315
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,520
isn't much yet yeah and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

316
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,590
some of the other think that were

317
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,630
discussed in the context of the public

318
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,650
subscribe that Mike Ross has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

319
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:59,480
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're cast you refer them as</font>

320
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:02,510
the Buddhist still like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um and and</font>

321
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">also with the notion of device sleeping</font>

322
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,199
sleeping devices and some of those

323
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,819
requirements that come from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iod word</font>

324
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:12,350
that are not necessarily a sort of it

325
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">waits not necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately</font>

326
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,579
obvious on how to map them to the rest

327
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,510
design<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think those would also be</font>

328
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:22,119
interesting to discuss there because

329
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:25,220
that's where things get interesting

330
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,479
right I think that's a valid point and

331
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,260
that will here we go into their design

332
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">patterns far because we're thinking on</font>

333
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,410
writing something along the lines of

334
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,000
okay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your problem and quite</font>

335
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,280
communicants of the funny result will be

336
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,440
a better kind of way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that so it</font>

337
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,649
thinks leaving notes<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in that</font>

338
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,060
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks I guess we have to</font>

339
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:50,450
move on yeah I think I would summarize

340
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,399
this as the objective of this works not

341
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,020
so much do you find what rest is there

342
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,540
is a nice PhD thesis you can read about

343
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,430
that but to find out what can rest bring

344
00:17:56,540 --> 00:18:00,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the table or four or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet of</font>

345
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what is the right way to use</font>

346
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,770
rest maybe even to give up some of the

347
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,040
principles if you find out they they

348
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,780
hurt us in some places or to add once if

349
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:17,440
we find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need so rest will not</font>

350
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:23,480
entirely emerge unchanged from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

351
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:27,080
exercise<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay 11 other document that we</font>

352
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,400
are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's a survey document so</font>

353
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,090
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to collect information</font>

354
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,480
about how secure bootstrapping is done

355
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and work</font>

356
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:43,979
good afternoon I move it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

357
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:46,109
presenting our draft on secure IOT

358
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:48,989
bootstrapping and to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

359
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:52,129
context in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yokohama meeting we look</font>

360
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:54,989
at the security considerations draft and

361
00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:57,448
we have this general feeling that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> OT</font>

362
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:59,039
bootstrapping is kind of very important

363
00:18:57,449 --> 00:19:00,599
and there was sufficient interest in the

364
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:08,009
group so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

365
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:09,749
separate document and one of the first

366
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,699
challenges that we faced is how do you

367
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:13,739
define secure boot<font color="#E5E5E5"> strapping it means a</font>

368
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:15,449
lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to know of</font>

369
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:18,179
different people and this is the

370
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition we came up with right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font>

371
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:22,739
it's the process by which an IOT IOT

372
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,559
device in our OT network security

373
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:29,609
becomes operational at a given location

374
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:32,158
and point of time so so the goals of of

375
00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:35,428
secure boot strapping can be many things

376
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,739
it can be authenticating a pre-existing

377
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,440
identity or or creating a new identity

378
00:19:37,739 --> 00:19:44,849
it can be for authorization for network

379
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:49,979
access IC harness on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic already you</font>

380
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:51,718
want me to stunt young alum the where

381
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:53,849
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get that definition from at</font>

382
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:57,239
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OMA definition and</font>

383
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,579
it's not the OSCE ocf definition so this

384
00:19:57,239 --> 00:20:02,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">is from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the security considerations</font>

385
00:19:58,579 --> 00:20:03,928
document that sundeep was working on but

386
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it just confuses if you</font>

387
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:07,679
introduce another definition that none

388
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:09,899
of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> documents use but with the</font>

389
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,839
same term now it's from the security

390
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:15,539
considerations document so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you</font>

security conservation document is is

393
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:24,179
it's not an individual document that

394
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:26,369
didn't go anywhere Oh to research group

395
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,229
has decided to work on it as one of the

396
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,779
contributions<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but you can change</font>

397
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:32,699
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I'm welcome please feel</font>

list I'm not hard bound with this

400
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:40,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">definition if you feel there's something</font>

401
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:41,698
missing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I just want to be used one</font>

00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,619
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing definitions or something</font>

403
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:45,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's closer to what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are but these</font>

404
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">other guys are because otherwise you</font>

405
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,319
would be reading other documents use the

406
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:50,260
same term a<font color="#CCCCCC"> complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> centered on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

407
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,490
list

408
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,920
incorporate so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the goals</font>

409
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,550
of secure boot strapping it could be for

410
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,500
a author ization of network access it

411
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,190
could be for creating these groups or

412
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,080
domains and of course for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing one</font>

413
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,900
IOT device with another device or

414
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">keyring 11 i would securely appearing</font>

415
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,480
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would be device to a cloud service</font>

416
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:19,030
and this definition is kind of very

417
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,210
broad but it's on a purpose because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OT</font>

418
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself is so broad so for me I OT is not</font>

419
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,130
your sensors<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's any you even</font>

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphones and if I pair smartphones</font>

421
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,610
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth to the exchange files</font>

422
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,860
that's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of secure boot</font>

423
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,199
strapping and the second example is

424
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,510
connecting sensors to the cloud back and

425
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,650
from where they receive security or

426
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:44,800
firmware upgrades so we try to

427
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">categorize these methods or classify</font>

428
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,620
this method so that it's more structured

429
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,840
and the first is managed methods where

430
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,209
the general assumption is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

431
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,820
reestablished trust relation and

432
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,980
authentication credentials and managed

433
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,510
methods can be centralized or federated

434
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,720
to give you an example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

435
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:09,129
EAP if you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> EAP psk or TLS you have a</font>

436
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,600
triple is over but you could also have

437
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like I do wrong there you have</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Federation of observers sorry for the</font>

441
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:27,430
has a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways to bootstrap devices</font>

442
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:32,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of them are falling into this</font>

443
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:34,270
managed category so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> category we</font>

444
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,429
identified when we started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

445
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,900
these bootstrapping methods was this p2p

446
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,700
your ad hoc methods and here the

447
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,250
assumption<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that devices don't have</font>

448
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:44,380
any clear stablish credentials and you

449
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:46,510
have you typically do an authenticated

450
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:48,370
if you have an exchange and to prevent

451
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:52,390
the man in the middle attack you have to

452
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:54,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">use out-of-band channel so the previous</font>

453
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:57,520
example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smartphones over</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bluetooth or using Wi-Fi Protected setup</font>

455
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,350
if you were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> socked in the previous</font>

456
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,820
session you might have listen to the

457
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:09,730
talk about using

458
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:11,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh be with EAP moving on then there's</font>

459
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,110
the opportunistic or leap of faith

460
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,930
methods and here the point is not so

461
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">much as as as the initial authentication</font>

462
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:22,840
itself but rather to check that the same

463
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,330
initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity is used throughout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

464
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,820
the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the continuity of the</font>

465
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">identity of connection and if some</font>

466
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,629
methods might assume that the attacker

467
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,080
is not present at the initial setup so

468
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,090
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of ssh leap of faith there</font>

469
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,909
is one example but of course send and

470
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:42,699
CGA and you're signing up on gmail<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

471
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:44,650
one example where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign first and</font>

472
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,360
then gmail just checks that you are the

473
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:50,560
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> person every time you go and log</font>

474
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">into gmail or facebook and of course</font>

475
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">most methods actually use some</font>

476
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:58,200
components from<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed and ad-hoc so</font>

477
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why they are hybrid and</font>

478
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,180
categorization is not always easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

479
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:07,060
clear and choice of bootstrapping method

480
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,740
heavily depends on the business case so

481
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:11,500
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> honda's pointed out in the sog</font>

482
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,200
meeting of course business cases governs

483
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,610
what bootstrapping methods are used most

484
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,890
of the time so what kind of third

485
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,870
parties are<font color="#E5E5E5"> available and who wants to</font>

486
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">retain the control or avoid the work</font>

487
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:28,209
done and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> why are we doing this</font>

488
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:30,610
it's to learn the designers options and

489
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,500
trade-offs our goal is not to review<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

490
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing bootstrapping methods and</font>

491
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:38,620
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 page document that no one</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">will ever read and instead we want to</font>

493
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,209
help iod application developers to look

494
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,200
at the document and decide what's

495
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:49,330
suitable for them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-of-life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> andrew</font>

496
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,190
bootstrapping is actually a very complex

497
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:55,389
topic so if you have been following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

498
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,760
news about the revolve smart hub and how

499
00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:00,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been great now it's actually</font>

500
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite tricky and we would like to</font>

501
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:04,510
actually have a discussion on on that in

502
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are welcome to</font>

503
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:11,870
contribute on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font>

504
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,870
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was it any questions</font>

505
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,540
yeah sorry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last site doesn't contain</font>

506
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,990
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out of the duck change to</font>

507
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:31,649
another odds of urgency they're here and

508
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:34,260
so I think what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hannah said points out</font>

509
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,960
that one important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was not in</font>

510
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:40,590
this light is that you need to work on

511
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,630
terminology and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be another</font>

512
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,730
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we may want to intensify</font>

513
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:49,800
because there is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many terms</font>

514
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:52,530
in use and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to Internet of</font>

515
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,260
Things people about commissioning and

516
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,970
things like that they all have very

517
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:02,129
different ideas of what berries<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

518
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,180
these were two of the three documents

519
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,580
that we are working on right now and I

520
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,100
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outreach</font>

521
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:15,090
component<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already said that we did a</font>

522
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:19,050
little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work there so what's the</font>

523
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:24,629
point the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we actually want</font>

524
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:27,240
to do mutual education with other stos

525
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:31,920
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this other standards developing</font>

526
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">realizations in this space so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

527
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:39,450
educate each other about the way that

528
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,610
other body works so we want to

529
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:45,090
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> ocf works and all Ciara</font>

530
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants understand how we work but of</font>

531
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,820
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also want to know what what</font>

532
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,500
are the interesting products they have

533
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what are these already doing how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

534
00:26:52,500 --> 00:27:01,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">they fit in the into the overall picture</font>

535
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:03,860
and how are these completing the picture

536
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,210
or maybe raising additional research

537
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,090
questions that's really the reason why

538
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:13,530
it's a good idea for research group to

539
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:18,179
have these outreach activities so as I

540
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:20,670
said what is ongoing and pretty close

541
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,600
cooperation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the one with the w3c</font>

542
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:27,270
interest group on aware of things that

543
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,840
interest group is very much in the

544
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:32,410
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now of chartering it's</font>

545
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,209
working groups so we will

546
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:39,250
start to interact<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their working</font>

547
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:41,560
groups as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had one meeting</font>

548
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:45,430
with the open connectivity<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation</font>

549
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:48,909
now right there and we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

550
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:51,280
increase<font color="#CCCCCC"> the involvement and that's a</font>

551
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,570
typical example for a problem we have

552
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,870
there because they kind of have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

553
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,030
working in a bunker for a year and then

554
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some point came out with their</font>

555
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:05,740
specification 1.0 and then finally we

556
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:09,250
could find out what they were by doing

557
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:12,610
and maybe places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we might have had</font>

558
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:16,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful info input if they had asked us</font>

559
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:18,699
earlier down we have had some

560
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:21,100
discussions with a brutal brutal of

561
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,700
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an interesting connectivity</font>

562
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:26,620
technology but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bluetooth also has some</font>

563
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,870
application layer components that are

564
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:32,219
very interesting to go interface through

565
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:35,139
an internet of things that are involved

566
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,800
now these are just three organizations

567
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:42,580
and there are about 150 we are probably

568
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,850
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover all those 150 but I</font>

569
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:49,000
would very much like to hear from you

570
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:51,520
are there any other standards developing

571
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,550
organizations that you actually work

00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:28,510
becoming more likely i think that many

665
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,730
me that we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good</font>

course first of all everything that is

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous slide understanding what</font>

689
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:22,319
all the other group operates but we also

690
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,390
found a number of common areas work in

691
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:27,420
particular in the areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

692
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,960
models and interaction models where it

693
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,869
is very good to have the different

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,460
cannot speak for their lines here but i

701
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,519
think they mentioned yesterday about the

702
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,160
semantic the data models are degree ln

703
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,229
participative fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't believe i</font>

704
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,578
don't know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't believe there is</font>

a data point I can take an action item

707
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:14,009
and talk to that you know organization

708
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:17,969
and this members meeting is happening in

709
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:20,519
June first week in Amsterdam so um I can

710
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:22,440
basically enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> me touch with you and</font>

711
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,250
like if there is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity</font>

712
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,500
sometimes you know other organ

they come and<font color="#CCCCCC"> present what's going on if</font>

714
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,300
that is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the objectives also right</font>

715
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:34,870
because it's happening in Europe and you

716
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:37,780
know where this I rdf work activities

717
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:40,900
and we present it that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you</font>

718
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:43,720
know action item but I can definitely

719
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,570
check with that the organization and you

720
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,919
know get back to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I don't</font>

721
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe there is any in the other</font>

722
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">retired here with the valence really</font>

723
00:36:50,890 --> 00:37:03,250
thank you okay so um I just said we had

724
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,770
a missing you it's just a power thought

725
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,530
with in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outreach have the</font>

726
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,990
cheers<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of contacting sort of a</font>

727
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:14,050
couple of influential aight aight blogs

728
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:16,959
and talking to the editors and putting

729
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:25,630
it out there that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

730
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:29,110
this idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> for contact you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you I so meet</font>

731
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:31,930
adjustability so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just have a</font>

732
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">few questions the outreach cooperation</font>

733
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:39,850
is this something a part of the charter

734
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:42,520
of this working group oh and is this

735
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:48,220
some something we like other working

736
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:51,730
group in IETF for example debt net6 low

737
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">six fish we can take advantage how will</font>

738
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:59,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process work then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if we get</font>

739
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:02,170
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about other stos</font>

740
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:06,460
technologies and their deployment so

741
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually you know I I guess due to TRG is</font>

742
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:11,770
the right place or those kind of

743
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:17,680
collaboration<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then are you planning</font>

744
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:22,630
to connect to their relevant other IETF

745
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:26,440
working groups if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is any relevant</font>

746
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:28,060
topic that we should know but first of

747
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,730
all I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are we are pretty good</font>

748
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:34,150
connected with the ITF Merkel said that

749
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've working in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> di okie state so I think</font>

750
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:37,880
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

751
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,109
of course the idea is not to replace the

752
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:44,990
IAB the IETF has a defined J'son model

753
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:48,619
which involves the the IAB where we need

754
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,419
formal relationships and of course most

755
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the useful work is done in informal</font>

756
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:54,800
relationships are people who work in

757
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,859
both organizations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not trying</font>

758
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that we're just trying to have</font>

759
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:06,049
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more high-level discussion</font>

760
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:09,980
more at the architectural level that

761
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:12,800
often is hard to initiate with other

762
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:16,760
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and that could</font>

763
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:22,580
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first entry point when about me</font>

764
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:24,980
but their relationship and<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue and</font>

765
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:27,410
I would also comment on the working

766
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's versus the research group as our</font>

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Charter says um the things that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

768
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,260
ours who are the ones that have

769
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,730
potential for<font color="#CCCCCC"> standardization so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> East</font>

770
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,380
annotation it's already happening in a

771
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:38,660
working group of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a natural</font>

772
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">place to discuss some issue but if</font>

773
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,109
there's some issue and address do is

774
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,910
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that is currently not in many</font>

775
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:45,380
of our working groups and energy would

776
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,470
be natural place to discuss that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

777
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,030
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will be no forwarding</font>

778
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,029
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> right places when we see the</font>

779
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,950
connections well I can't pick nasty one

780
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:56,869
you asked about other organizations you

781
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:00,490
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check into you might want</font>

782
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:04,490
to look at the geo spatial organization

783
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:09,609
consortium do a lot of beta but tensor

784
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:11,959
webs and things like that right so

785
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:16,210
looking at the space that the research

786
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,710
group spends we probably won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

787
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:21,230
application specific data models so we

788
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,869
are not so interested in what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

789
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:26,000
alight how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define the color space</font>

790
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:28,820
of a life<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are domain specific</font>

791
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,040
organizations who do this very well and

792
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,230
our job is probably more or to find out

793
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,060
where are these organizations how it can

794
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,930
we collect information there then

795
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,670
actually doing the work with them so

796
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:43,160
there's kind of a limit to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

797
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:45,260
organizations we can talk to it at any

798
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,980
specific point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's really</font>

799
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:50,420
important to know about

800
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit optimistic to</font>

801
00:40:50,420 --> 00:41:03,500
do this section in six minutes I then

802
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:07,640
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my peers for the next day thank</font>

803
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,900
you custom so a semantic

804
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,900
interoperability requires

805
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,810
self-describing into action<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeled step</font>

806
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,610
was a position<font color="#CCCCCC"> paper that we handed in</font>

807
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,520
to the IEP workshop on semantic

808
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:21,620
interoperability kind of summarizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">part that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that's</font>

810
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:28,160
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T RG and</font>

811
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah so in general it was well accepted</font>

812
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,319
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are information models</font>

813
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,970
required for interoperability so that

814
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,220
you can make use of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

815
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:40,029
produced by the IOT devices this is

816
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,680
mainly about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what what does it mean</font>

817
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,870
our position or that what we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

818
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,359
accomplish is that we also have a model

819
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:49,640
that this machine readable to describe

820
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,740
the how so how can machines actually

821
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,629
access this information in describe this

822
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:58,939
in a good way and so what we've found

823
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,400
out so far it's quite straightforward to

824
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,770
include descriptions for this on the

825
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,270
server side but then the consumption of

826
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> description on the client side is</font>

827
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard and also for programmers</font>

828
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,440
finding that the right abstractions is

829
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,779
hard and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we often ended up</font>

830
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,310
with the hard-coded into action models

831
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,070
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have this kind of machine</font>

832
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,259
readable flexible interaction model so

833
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,290
why do we actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we needed to</font>

834
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,730
handle change and it's specifically

835
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,770
interesting for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT because we will</font>

836
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">have devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things that are out</font>

837
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:33,620
there for decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

838
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,720
we can interact or can bind two things

839
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:39,140
together so a light switch can work with

840
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,540
a lot like up and we also want you to

841
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:44,810
replace this with new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

842
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,970
they can control alternative things it's

843
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:49,130
like a point we want to add new things

844
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also be controlled but we also</font>

845
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,430
want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these kind of new</font>

846
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:55,460
things work still with the old things

847
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:57,080
and the critical thing is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

848
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,670
also want that the old things can work

849
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,670
with the new things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually are</font>

850
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,760
designed later

851
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,440
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need a kind of an</font>

852
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,930
interaction model that more describes

853
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,880
how can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do not</font>

854
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:13,410
hard code it that it just works with the

855
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,089
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know already so to</font>

856
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">summarize for semantic interpretation of</font>

857
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:19,319
course we need the information model so

858
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,299
this is describing the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

859
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:23,339
is exchanged<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

860
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:26,790
vocabulary so that we agree on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

861
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:29,819
know the meaning what exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

862
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:33,779
some connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the w3c what working</font>

863
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:35,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">group they try to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the semantic</font>

864
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,640
model rooted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> rdf to have these kind</font>

865
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,359
of descriptions and be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on we are</font>

866
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,470
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the interaction model so</font>

867
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:45,299
describing the possible interactions

868
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:48,509
that also needs vocabularies so there's

869
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:50,250
a quite a similarity here and we and

870
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:53,520
particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to use in to look</font>

871
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:56,400
into hyper media driven applications so

872
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,009
what comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the hypermedia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

873
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:04,890
engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application state constrained</font>

874
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:06,990
from rest so how does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

875
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,440
quick summary how our<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach looks</font>

876
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:12,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so we compose things or model</font>

877
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,579
things for multiple resources so yeah

878
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,770
resource model in rest and then we have

879
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,349
these atomic attack steps or a

880
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,170
request-response exchange that shape the

881
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes how yeah the whole application</font>

882
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:28,650
should work and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a committee</font>

883
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:32,960
you use links in forms to describe how a

884
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:35,790
machine can formulate these requests and

885
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,799
we need some vocabulary so these r l

886
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,869
types or link relation heights and

887
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:41,400
formulation types to put some meaning

888
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,569
what does it mean to invoke is

889
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,400
intellectual right now actually and

890
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:50,190
because the server can publish these

891
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,609
links and forms during<font color="#CCCCCC"> run time we also</font>

892
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:56,490
can influence something at runtime and

893
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:59,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">something is happening so here's a nice</font>

894
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,140
illustration of the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing what is</font>

895
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:04,710
going on so the idea is that the client

896
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:07,020
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entry point affordable thing and</font>

897
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,730
entry point your eye off mrs.<font color="#CCCCCC"> McCall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

898
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,349
instance pointing to a resource

899
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,329
directory it could be your<font color="#CCCCCC"> google search</font>

900
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,759
engine and from there we follow links

901
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,859
we get a couple of links back we select

902
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:19,719
the right link and we follow<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and from</font>

903
00:45:17,859 --> 00:45:21,788
there we follow again links so this

904
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,589
could be on the same resource on this

905
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:25,719
air on the same thing could also point

906
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,900
to other things the second component is

907
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:31,150
we can in these documents we also learn

908
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">about forms so we can invoke actions and</font>

909
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:35,950
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> submit the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form it could create a new</font>

910
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">resource but it also can produce</font>

911
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,259
something like an actual result if we

912
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,299
process something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance and his</font>

913
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:45,809
pattern continues so the only thing we

914
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:48,400
do is follow links and submit forms and

915
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:50,170
those need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be described</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

916
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,809
formulate the whole process that is

917
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:55,059
going on so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you see is</font>

918
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:57,339
you have to follow a lot of these links

919
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,719
which might be inefficient and so on so

920
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are a lot of optimizations that</font>

921
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:03,339
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible one obvious here is to use</font>

922
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:05,920
bookmarking that is known from from the

923
00:46:03,339 --> 00:46:08,259
web so once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found the exact resource</font>

924
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,299
where I constantly want to get the

925
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:12,190
sensor reading I can bookmark this and

926
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,989
interact with that one and just read it

927
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:18,009
out so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to have all the</font>

928
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:19,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">discovered process every time and the</font>

929
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:22,209
nice thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because we can publish</font>

930
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:24,430
this at runtime we can decide at a later

931
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:26,109
point hey we need a new mechanism here

932
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,390
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> resource before instance want to</font>

933
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:31,808
have some access control there so we can

934
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:33,969
redirect the link and insert during

935
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:37,869
runtime a new kind of process step and

936
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:39,279
this way handle change and the

937
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:40,630
challenging part we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

938
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:45,219
how to find the programming abstractions

939
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:46,930
for that another ongoing work is about

940
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,809
okay how do we convey all this

941
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,819
information so year's draft by Kawasaki

942
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,269
and to have a more concise

943
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:59,079
representation of links and forms

944
00:46:54,269 --> 00:47:01,269
leverages sip or two to encode all this

945
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">and but there's also a more generic work</font>

946
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:08,019
going on so what kind of links and forms

947
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:10,269
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT so the</font>

948
00:47:08,019 --> 00:47:12,819
summer is we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve semantic</font>

949
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:15,368
entrepreneurial ability with this where

950
00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:18,279
change handling change is a high

951
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:20,410
objective of course we need information

952
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:23,079
models for that and there are some

953
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:24,308
relation to the w3<font color="#E5E5E5"> but working group so</font>

954
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,900
we have these joint meetings because

955
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:26,830
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is information</font>

956
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:29,200
model

957
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,850
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the interaction model</font>

958
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,549
ever decide immediate written

959
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:36,460
application approach and which we also

960
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:39,580
by the way try to establish at the

961
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,990
definitions at the w3c so that this is

962
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,720
kind of the benefit we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

963
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful they hopefully also go see this</font>

964
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,259
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and then had some alignment</font>

965
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:50,800
across different standardization

966
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:52,690
organizations so what's also happening

967
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,220
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work defining these scenarios so</font>

968
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:57,940
once we have the reference scenarios

969
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,799
that are also in the Charter those more

970
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">disrupted the requirements and</font>

971
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,780
challenges we have and then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

972
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,880
support progress scenarios they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

973
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,610
work on implementation so that's where

974
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,440
you can come bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> your prototype and we</font>

975
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,630
see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can interoperate and if the</font>

976
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,850
whole approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually works out and</font>

977
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,520
then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we provide building</font>

978
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:20,470
blocks that can be used so like these

979
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,390
machine understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> will links and form</font>

980
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,310
so coral<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a current approach there and</font>

981
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:26,170
yeah other building blocks that you

982
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,770
basically need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement this kind</font>

983
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,770
of scenario

984
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,210
custom do you have a link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

985
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:39,800
repository on github where there's more

986
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">information because this is the quick</font>

987
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,320
summary if you found something that

988
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:48,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it would be</font>

989
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:50,090
good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find all this yeah and a lot of</font>

990
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,950
pieces are also open source so you can

991
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,870
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and we are</font>

992
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:56,180
definitely looking for more participants

993
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,339
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backrests so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find this is</font>

994
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:02,270
interesting please start implementing

995
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:04,870
this sent this mails on the mailing list

996
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:07,850
and yeah come to the back rest and then

997
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:16,190
shape how we actually solve this or<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

998
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:17,750
to solve this thank you i<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope know that</font>

999
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:19,750
the terms information model and

1000
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:24,830
interaction what does mean a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1001
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:26,930
more so the problem we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

1002
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:30,080
is of course that the world is

1003
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:33,020
complicated and there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

1004
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and there will be many things</font>

1005
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:37,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there that have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> characteristics</font>

1006
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:42,520
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operate on in this</font>

1007
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:46,460
information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction models and</font>

1008
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:50,270
there was a workshop a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weeks</font>

1009
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago organized by the IAB under the charm</font>

1010
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:56,990
semantic interoperability and one

1011
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:02,030
hypothesis that was formed at this

1012
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:04,250
workshop is there won't be one schema

1013
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:06,920
that describes the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean their</font>

1014
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:09,140
sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects like you might might</font>

1015
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,020
have heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that it's writing this</font>

1016
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:16,490
email for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but it's kind of</font>

1017
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:19,100
difficult and worse there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

1018
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:21,799
even going to be one language where<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1019
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:26,779
different domains are using different

1020
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:29,060
ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe the world and however</font>

1021
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to build systems where we have lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1022
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,140
things communicating with each other

1023
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,870
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are cut that are coming from</font>

1024
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:39,560
different domains we need to bring this

1025
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:42,460
in some form together and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

1026
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:46,750
many of these things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> way beyond</font>

1027
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:50,800
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in VI EGF however we</font>

1028
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:53,020
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface to movies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so we</font>

1029
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,359
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interested in in technologies</font>

1030
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:57,910
that can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to collect this</font>

1031
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,819
information to integrate this

1032
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:04,960
information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in particular also to</font>

1033
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:08,770
translate between different modeling

1034
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,290
languages and just to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> a peek into</font>

1035
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,930
what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Tennessee in that</font>

1036
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:16,320
workshop now that's your usual you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1037
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:19,509
n things and you need to translate

1038
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:23,950
between them picture and so you need n

1039
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:27,550
square minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> M translators and that's</font>

1040
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:30,669
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the intent of things well</font>

1041
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:33,099
maybe there is something that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be put</font>

1042
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:37,869
in the middle and that can serve as a

1043
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:40,990
hub but yeah this would be how to form

1044
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:43,260
and most likely it will not be one such

1045
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:47,529
a red star but there will be number of

1046
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:49,990
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will differ for instance</font>

1047
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:53,410
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of data loss you're</font>

1048
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:56,799
getting when translating from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

1049
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:59,440
to four different but it's also

1050
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,349
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about two different</font>

1051
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">levels here we can translate data from</font>

1052
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:06,820
different data<font color="#E5E5E5"> models so trivial example</font>

1053
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,980
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is we have a temperature</font>

1054
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,839
sensor that generates Fahrenheit

1055
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:16,480
temperatures and we want to know that

1056
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:18,460
information insurgencies but we also

1057
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,670
need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to translate the models</font>

1058
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:24,280
themselves in the first place so there

1059
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:26,109
is someone something that says this is

1060
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fahrenheit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base temperature sensor</font>

1061
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:31,170
and we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this same information</font>

1062
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:33,970
in a different place that is using a

1063
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:38,020
different model to describe the same

1064
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:39,879
information and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

1065
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">information it's not just about sensors</font>

1066
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,650
but it's also about<font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction so we</font>

1067
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:47,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have effects on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real world</font>

1068
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:52,640
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these effects often lead to</font>

1069
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:55,640
we actuated through interactions through

1070
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,549
multiple steps before my coffee machine

1071
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:01,279
can make cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me that needs to know</font>

1072
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:05,210
what the strength of the coffee that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1073
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:08,150
want and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on done so looking more</font>

1074
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,190
closely it actually turns out this is an

1075
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:13,910
area where we of course have lots of

1076
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:17,650
prior work so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the information</font>

1077
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:20,118
model space we probably have three

1078
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:21,650
layers we have the information model

1079
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:23,750
layer we have the data model layer and

1080
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:26,390
we have something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a serialization</font>

1081
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and of course each of these layers has</font>

1082
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:32,319
about 10 different terms that are not

1083
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:37,340
entirely compatible with each other so

1084
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:41,900
just taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing state of</font>

1085
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:45,140
the art is not trivial so what we need

1086
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:49,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out is how far can we get here</font>

1087
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:52,210
Can Can we maybe even build little

1088
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,730
systems that demonstrate some capability

1089
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:57,950
what are the limits to the translation

1090
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:00,410
because there are always things getting

1091
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:03,910
in the way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually what what is</font>

1092
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:06,410
getting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way our security issues</font>

1093
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:11,569
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next things we want to</font>

1094
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:15,170
take up is looking at this very wide

1095
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:19,210
field and find those areas that the

1096
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:21,530
research group should be taking up

1097
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,990
research<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should be encouraging</font>

1098
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:26,869
that's one of the things a research

1099
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,759
group can do just<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe the</font>

1100
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:30,619
challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are having in such a</font>

1101
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:34,100
way that researchers can can go ahead

1102
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">and work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on these challenges and then of</font>

1103
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:41,740
course find that research and take it in

1104
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:41,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this organization</font>

1105
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:48,480
you want he an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay do you</font>

1106
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:55,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to hear an answer to that question</font>

1107
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:57,690
yes okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so what I would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1108
00:54:55,019 --> 00:55:02,250
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone could look at some of</font>

1109
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:04,380
the popular sanitation results and try

1110
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:06,509
to actually create the mapping between

1111
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:09,210
the different data models there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1112
00:55:06,509 --> 00:55:11,930
challenges um first because some of the

1113
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations haven't actually are</font>

1114
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:17,160
written down<font color="#CCCCCC"> their data model in a</font>

1115
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,930
machine-readable form so it would be

1116
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,490
they have to extract it from a

1117
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:25,230
specification some did and then one has

1118
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,819
to go through sort of figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how the</font>

1119
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,609
mapping could look like and to see

1120
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:31,710
whether that that actually works I think

1121
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:36,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encouraging</font>

1122
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:39,750
as a secondary step um some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> op</font>

1123
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:42,000
and some I know of<font color="#CCCCCC"> one example they're</font>

1124
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:44,130
all seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance guys had sent me a</font>

1125
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,700
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their Microsoft wishers with</font>

1126
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:51,900
your Express<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugin where they use their</font>

1127
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:55,500
describe information and information

1128
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,720
communication model who then generate

1129
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:01,410
code that is sort of like as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> b-side</font>

1130
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">which was always pretty cool and but I</font>

1131
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:05,879
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen any others but then once we</font>

1132
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:09,380
have this first exercise of the map we

1133
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,640
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially get actually do</font>

1134
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:15,240
automatically generate code from one to

1135
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,160
the other or can use the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1136
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:19,250
have been worked out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1137
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,960
more automatically even four gateways I

1138
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:26,329
would be very interesting I haven't seen

1139
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:29,279
that work even trying to do the mappings

1140
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:32,119
I cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> find anything like someone who</font>

1141
00:56:29,279 --> 00:56:36,029
had tried that say the likely emblem

1142
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:38,400
object model to the OIC one or something

1143
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:40,140

00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,799
you knows I would be really interested

1145
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:46,200
to look at those recite the people have

1146
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:49,250
been translating<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rhonda XML and</font>

1147
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:55,288
things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> do these things</font>

1148
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:56,570
exist but yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my pocket I'm Gabrus</font>

1149
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:59,640
crap

1150
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:02,220
just respond to that the comments at the

1151
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,129
ifc workshop<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually agree with our</font>

1152
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:07,589
members comments they were but that you

1153
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,570
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate code for stoves for any two</font>

1154
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,490
things but you actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

1155
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:13,260
code to do the methane because the data

1156
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:14,459
models aren't and aren't automatically

1157
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,930
compatible you actually have to write

1158
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,030
conversion code so i don't think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1159
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:20,129
do that and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a point that</font>

1160
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:23,640
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product at sea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workshop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1161
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:26,040
think those generally I'm respond

1162
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,930
student um I remembered at this world

1163
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:31,590
but i think it was set in a context

1164
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:35,069
where it was mentioned of like zombie

1165
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:37,710
the bluetooth sig<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-energy work where</font>

1166
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:42,180
they use not a restful style but instead

1167
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:45,150
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> an RPC based mechanism and you</font>

1168
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:46,529
there is no formal description of how

1169
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,060
the interaction what you actually have

1170
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:50,330
to read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specification to</font>

1171
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:53,610
figure this out so it's that has some

1172
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:54,840
inherent limitation where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arctic</font>

1173
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:57,420
obviously doesn't work out of etiquette

1174
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,700
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information is buried in</font>

1175
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,830
hundreds of pages of PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> specifications</font>

1176
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,899
of individuals and just a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> reminder</font>

1177
00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:05,279
we have three minutes left of second

1178
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,310
time so if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your comments</font>

1179
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,870
short thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I was going to pass</font>

1180
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,940
one Alice's comment and then Mike

1181
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:14,250
similar comment to Tate but I think if

1182
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:18,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IIT workshop we also had discussion</font>

1183
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:21,360
about what returners atoms which were

1184
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:24,540
certain compatible elements between all

1185
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:27,030
the data different profiles data models

1186
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:29,120
and then these could be put together to

1187
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:31,650
form sort of molecules and more complex

1188
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,180
systems so encourage people they have a

1189
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:35,160
look at the slides around that too I

1190
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,049
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a really helpful for</font>

1191
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the workshop at</font>

1192
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:45,210
none epic since it's on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same topic</font>

1193
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,910
mckisco watch i would say generating

1194
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:49,680
code is not you and I think it's even

1195
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:51,450
pointless it doesn't help if I have to

1196
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,040
reprogram my device to make it work with

1197
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:54,390
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of device and if</font>

1198
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,670
there's not one I have to reprogram

1199
00:58:54,390 --> 00:59:01,049
under guys again doesn't help in the

1200
00:58:56,670 --> 00:59:03,150
whole interoperability<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amundson</font>

1201
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:05,370
with CA Technologies I would just say

1202
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,380
that interoperability should only be at

1203
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:08,850
the message and nowhere else we

1204
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,960
shouldn't concern ourselves with

1205
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:12,720
anything behind

1206
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,369
the interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can be interoperable in</font>

1207
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,779
message format and that includes the

1208
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:17,580
semantics because that's the hard work

1209
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:19,260
but what happens behind that we should

1210
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:25,770
not know about data models or anything

1211
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:28,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">patient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they should be severed thanks in</font>

1212
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:31,020
response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Medea said yeah there</font>

1213
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:34,200
seems to be some controversy about what

1214
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:36,000
the different goals are and some people

1215
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,299
who believe in some of the goals but not

1216
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,040
any others and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely agree</font>

1217
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:43,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the stuff that you</font>

1218
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,290
previously presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> has obviously more</font>

1219
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:48,480
powerful concepts in there but

1220
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,950
unfortunately this is all this body<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1221
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,920
work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been done in the past</font>

1222
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are using where your stuff hasn't</font>

1223
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:56,490
been done yet so you the question is

1224
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:00,240
like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with that part and</font>

1225
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:05,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's where these things</font>

1226
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:07,560
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> in if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't believe yeah if</font>

1227
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,089
you're opening in on this slide says

1228
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,250
what should we be encouraging and one of

1229
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:13,619
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult as Dave</font>

1230
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:15,089
villagers said about there's code for

1231
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:17,160
the mapping so that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all the</font>

1232
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:18,839
semantic tagging in the world but if the

1233
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,029
fundamental modeling constructs are

1234
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:23,310
different then you can't match them up

1235
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:25,290
without some human interaction um for

1236
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:28,410
example units is either a flat list of

1237
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:31,259
enumerated units or it's like powers on

1238
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:33,960
the fundamental meter time lumens you

1239
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:36,960
know etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm yet completely different</font>

1240
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,070
ways of<font color="#E5E5E5"> expressing the units that's not</font>

1241
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,470
something that can be matched up by

1242
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">submitted k so that's what so what I'm</font>

1243
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,730
suggesting with that is not go as me but

1244
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,859
that a good research topic would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1245
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:49,020
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these like design patterns book</font>

1246
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:52,020
for these mappings that will have to be

1247
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:54,060
hard-coded and let's create a list of

1248
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:56,280
these mappings that are needed for the

1249
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:57,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">IOT space and then we can all hard coat</font>

1250
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,730
these mappings and then with proper

1251
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:01,500
semantic tagging I can find oh you have

1252
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:03,420
those kinds of units I know how to

1253
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">translate it into my new enumeration</font>

1254
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,869
over here otherwise we'll never have any

1255
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,480
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of automated mapping unless we</font>

1256
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:12,740
identify those things in code and a good

1257
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,550
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chipley 11 0 73</font>

1258

which has a lot of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeling arm</font>

1259
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:23,190
embed no lobbying on my work has been

1260
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:23,810
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's really depending on what</font>

1261
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:25,580
they're dealing

1262
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,770
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their that for most for medical</font>

1263
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:30,860
devices but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what they've</font>

1264
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:32,600
done there it's really much what can you

1265
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,610
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the network get over the media</font>

1266
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,569
and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's that make one</font>

1267
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:40,850
example see how energy can be I think

1268
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:43,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">each of us has their favorite</font>

01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:50,209
IDF has<font color="#CCCCCC"> yang and the management models</font>

1271
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:52,730
so we have some trusted experience with

1272
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:57,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to close on this</font>

1273
01:01:52,730 --> 01:02:01,460
particular topic but send your info to

1274
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list I really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear it so I</font>

1276
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:12,710
just quickly saying what are we going to

1277
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:15,620
do next so the meetings that we are

1278
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:21,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have actually need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover</font>

1279
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:25,370
these these different areas so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1280
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:31,880
one question you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room is a</font>

1281
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:35,690
professor andrew loura so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what</font>

1282
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:39,590
we really useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss about ways</font>

1283
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:45,200
to get academic researchers involved in

1284
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:46,730
this so if you can can talk to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

1296
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,209
would make like a make a quick

1297
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:35,609
announcement

1298
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:41,910
one of the problems that we are having

1299
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:44,460
is software updates and a general things

1300
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:47,640
devices need to be updated or you have

1301
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:51,120
to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> them away nope there are lots</font>

1302
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:54,930
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing that so it's at rest</font>

1303
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:57,630
side it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a research problem but</font>

1304
01:03:54,930 --> 01:04:00,720
then if you look a little bit closer

1305
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:04,320
there are a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

1306
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,359
around software updates that raise new

1307
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:11,700
questions where maybe the existing

1308
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:15,960
mechanisms don't quite work so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1309
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:19,009
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a workshop in dual to discuss</font>

1310
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,660
these new issues or extended issues

1311
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:25,230
around software<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's how can the future</font>
