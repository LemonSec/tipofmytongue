16
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,419
okay first of all why don't we start

17
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,449
with why don't we start with a report

18
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,919
from the remote hubs listen you we have

19
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:34,500
we have of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course people from Latin</font>

20
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,109
America people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from India who have hubs</font>

21
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,810
already I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right nobody</font>

22
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,970
else has hubs already good maybe why

23
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't we start we do the latin america</font>

24
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:50,009
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the host so crystianna it's</font>

25
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:56,180
very simple denise is to say so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far bit</font>

26
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:59,639
there were more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 35 psyche 25 26</font>

27
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,740
locations yes again actually not all of

28
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,330
them on different locations there are

29
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,940
several for example we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you out</font>

30
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,280
here from<font color="#CCCCCC"> receive they their inner city</font>

31
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,570
did one for each session so the world

32
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,179
Wow many there and there was a

33
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:17,849
university<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venezuela that also hold on</font>

34
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:23,249
one and another

35
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:25,860
some of them were the same that beep on

36
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:32,309
previous meetings like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one in Mexico</font>

37
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:34,439
so and I would say that probably half of

38
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:38,309
them are new locations or probably more

39
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:43,259
than new location and they've been going

40
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:47,119
well there were some emails on a promise

41
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,819
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> restoration or problems with a</font>

42
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:55,229
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> check or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but nothing</font>

43
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:59,729
major but these are were solved

44
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:01,830
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one thing I'm interested</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">would be super interesting I think is to</font>

49
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,740

51
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,009
maybe say these ideas or these

52
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:24,059
contributions out of remote hubs I don't

53
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:28,369
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys soon or yes all right</font>

54
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:33,689
I'm not aware of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific proposal</font>

55
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah contribution so far from okay what</font>

56
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:40,829
so so what hasn't worked sounds like um

57
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:48,479
initially some little problems with

58
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:50,579
getting started<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm not say that there</font>

59
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,438
were things that didn't work we left

60
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:57,509
from from cyril a from previous Cubs for

61
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,729
example something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different with it for</font>

62
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:01,229
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones we tried to resist rally</font>

63
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,378
participants in on the remote house

64
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,869
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up having many more</font>

65
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,490
remote participants because before that

66
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:10,979
we shall proceed that the one that was

67
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,009
with a computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not the ones that</font>

68
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:16,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">were attending oh now we ask all of them</font>

69
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,389
to the and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why the</font>

70
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,519
registration keeps growing because it

71
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:22,409
for the halves that are having for

72
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,449
example patients yet that were having

73
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,539
sessions yesterday those remote

74
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,419
participants are still a vehicle when

75
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,680
they attended account<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of advanced</font>

76
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:35,610
it's good though I think this

80
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">knew the other half are oh I think the</font>

81
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,870
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that is that we're</font>

82
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,719
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see continuity perfect thank</font>

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so we starting to see some</font>

88
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,770
continuity we're especially at some of

89
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,149
the universities like Mackenzie<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

90
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:08,160
Brazil<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they keep attending the same</font>

91
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups so they're starting to</font>

92
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,870
form a community there that you know

93
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,339
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk to each other and and</font>

94
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,410
eventually have ideas and hopefully

95
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:19,589
contributions as well it's yeah very

96
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important so you who wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tip from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">India or whoever people are you sure</font>

98
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:33,750
yeah hello so it's like from India this

99
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,469
time there were a 188 new participants

100
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:40,470
and out of 268 those registered for the

101
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,570
first time so that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in</font>

102
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,270
India and we have the universities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

103
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,950
institutions which are really want to

104
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:51,540
participate and they are really

105
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:55,200
contributing the words so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

106
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,569
activities related to IETF but now they

107
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,959
are understanding because of only<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

108
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,390
remote hubs and India is you know very

109
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,140
huge country geographically located so

110
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,140
there are around 13-14 remotes of

111
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,830
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the India this thing oh it's</font>

112
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:16,290
uh when we continue it it it will keep

113
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:22,650
on increasing the participation and it

114
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:24,980
will help us to contribute you know all

115
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:29,819
the technical activities related to

116
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:32,430
working groups and so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what what</font>

117
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:39,029
problems are you having or what hasn't

118
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:43,859
worked um actually of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its a like the</font>

119
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,059
problem is you know they know about IETF

120
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,239
but how

121
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:50,218
you know the working and for the

122
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:52,889
beginners it said you know it's

123
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:55,709
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand how out ITF</font>

124
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,779
works and in the working group so what

125
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,968
are the technical you know what other

126
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,909
things are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so first they have</font>

127
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:05,039
to catch up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

128
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:07,769
they are learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that is the proper</font>

129
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,679
you know initial problem at the same

130
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,979
time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example when it is in buena</font>

131
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,639
sighs the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timezone gap so that is again</font>

132
00:11:12,979 --> 00:11:19,589
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem so or two for the</font>

133
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,069
resolution of this we have divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,049
participation into two parts like those

135
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:27,718
who want to see the recordings for that

136
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:31,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have contacted the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> micro team so they</font>

137
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:34,439
can record the you know sessions in time

138
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:37,019
and after that they are giving next

139
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:39,748
morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am sending than the links</font>

140

141
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:46,439
same time those are you know oh oh

142

00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:06,509
have men is this thing yeah I think

149
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:09,509
forever for everybody maybe one out of

150
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:11,819
the three will be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult time</font>

151
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,279
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is in the world yeah but</font>

152
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:17,608
you're overcoming network challenges

153
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,349
you're not having connectivity and with

154
00:12:17,609 --> 00:12:23,189
that kind of stuff now really they're

155

172
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are some other organic ideas of</font>

173
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,540
doing remote helps maybe between not

174
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,340
focusing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University side but</font>

175
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:25,180
focusing more on the engineers were

176
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:28,060
working in various vendor offices and

177
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,890
who do not you usually work on the

178
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,869
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are the implementers but</font>

179
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,270
they usually don't take part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

180
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">other consumers of the standards mostly</font>

181
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,650
so we want them to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so that's</font>

182
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,900
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort we are doing we had a much</font>

183
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,000
better session in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yokohama this time</font>

184
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,579
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the time zones and this this</font>

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we are taking it slow but thanks to</font>

186
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier for letting her set up ITF hub</font>

187
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,930
bangalore and we are in starting the

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,650
process early on to make sure that we

189
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,630
propagate it better have the right set

190
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,730
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved one thing which work</font>

191
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,380
for us last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is making sure</font>

192
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,480
whichever working group we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing we</font>

193
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,430
have a working group champion we used to

194
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,860
make sure that there is like in a

195
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,750
one-hour session before we go through

196
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,600
the agenda before hand slides are

197
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,370
already up so that helped quite a bit

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
that he Apple were able to follow what's

199
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,570
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not everybody is</font>

200
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,160
basically the implementers they usually

201
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,750
focus on the part that I implementing

202
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do not worry about the whole thing</font>

203
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,240
so we wanted them to be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's</font>

204
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,800
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that has worked the</font>

205
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,590
thing that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work more on is</font>

206
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,510
 how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get more people involved</font>

207
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,100
sometimes what happens is especially the

208
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,500
implementers if they are implementing

209
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,020
one protocol the only are in that one

210
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,540
working group and and they only listen

211
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one mailing list so getting all</font>

212
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,370
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved so somehow in the</font>

213
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:51,640
idea we have to make sure that this

214
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:54,550
remote hub thinks is advertised properly

215
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,319
people who are not in the ITF attendee

216
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:59,140
list and otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> also know about</font>

217
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's happening so what we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done is</font>

218
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,890
at least to the vendors we know at least

219
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,390
some people in bangalore working for

220
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,640
each company so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have make sure that</font>

221
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:08,770
they tell everyone within their means so

222
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,510
apart from the ITF channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

223
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">already doing but through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF</font>

224
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,529
channel also if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

225
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,240
to advertise this bit more now we have

226
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:19,209
three months Berlin is going to suit us

227
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,459
our time zone very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so we want</font>

228
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:23,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a much more organized way</font>

229
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:25,869
at least in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bangalore with a</font>

230
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,389
different focus then from the University

231
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:32,470
so we want both to go in parallel they

232
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:34,180
are a different kind of remote ops so we

233
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,029
want both to go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> palette that's what I</font>

234
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:41,378
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks that's that let's stop</font>

235
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:46,300
for a moment and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a marketing</font>

236
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:49,360
if you will um I know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys for</font>

237
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,269
the lack Nick they had a young gal was

238
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,949
doing the facebook social media outreach

239
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:59,500
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock also did things I wonder</font>

240
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:02,680
if that's something we need to take more

241
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:08,379
advantage of at least that to start with

242
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,300
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think buddy simple can</font>

243
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:13,569
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done like or maybe have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

244
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,128
account for the remote hub and maybe or

245
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,589
a facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> page and direct people</font>

246
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:20,259
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> at not I don't like Facebook as</font>

247
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:22,060
much because no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook is making it</font>

248
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,970
hard for people to get update from pages

249
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,689
but Twitter we have a handle and then if

250
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:30,220
we can post as hubs come online or

251
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:32,849
people want to interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

252
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,490
handled that would be one way of

253
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,290
marketing say what you did again in the

254
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,410
front I lost the very first thing a

255
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage you think not a web page set up</font>

256
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,980
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter account that maybe tweets the</font>

257
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:50,050
locations of the remote hubs yeah and

258
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,259
maybe people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can interact with if they</font>

259
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,689
want to set a perimeter because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

260
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:59,290
what's happening that's what I see maybe

261
00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:02,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can correct me is mostly it's</font>

262
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:06,668
coming from the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

263
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:09,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF but if we kind of want to make</font>

264
00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:13,480
easy for everybody may be set up maybe a

265
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,890
small template and how to is one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

266
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,959
other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people want</font>

267
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,439
someone's really interested because I

268
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,939
know at least in bangalore there are

269
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,260
communities like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ovas panel which are</font>

270
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,630
working which are doing really really

271
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,350
great work in the security space but

272
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,730
extremely disconnected from ITF and that

273
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,699
is something that I am working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font>

274
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:38,550
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered the corporate and the</font>

275
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:41,920
engineers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> harish covered the</font>

276
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,899
academia but also people in the

277
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,370
community who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in either of these</font>

278
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,630
categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not completely connected</font>

279
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,300
with the ITF community they have

280
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,400
communities and maybe we can latch on to

281
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,990
that maybe have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meetup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are</font>

282
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,820
tons of metal cactus in bangalore I know

283
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,010
that tons of meetups we got late to take

284
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,230
so we can call co-locate with some of

285
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,450
them and just make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy because this</font>

286
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,920
announced and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe they can teach</font>

287
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,600
us through some channel and we can kind

288
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,790
of guide them to set up a remote of that

289
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,280
would be nice yeah that's an interesting

290
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:16,450
I don't think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF does Twitter does it</font>

291
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,760
oh yeah yeah oh let's tweak idea

292
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,080
actually does Twitter quite a lot I know

293
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI sock next gen which tweets a lot</font>

294
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,280
so I follow quite a bit of I saw

295
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">accounts and day to Twitter quite well</font>

296
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,760
so great great great yeah yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

297
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:36,850
tweet obviously so so Greg<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I saw</font>

298
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">comms work with idea um I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF does have</font>

299
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,189
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter account I would say one of the</font>

300
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to consider balancing is the</font>

301
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,820
reach to new audiences Twitter provides

302
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,780
right so people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're looking to</font>

303
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,879
engage like the non-academic operators

304
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,950
might be responsive to Twitter or it

305
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,080
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a breaching</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better that way the</font>

306
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,770
thing to balance i would say is the fact

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,889
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF twitter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not an official to</font>

308
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">ATF channel of communication so I think</font>

309
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,070
there might be an opportunity to use

310
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,260
Twitter to reach people but then to

311
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,040
bring them into the normal operating

312
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:13,960
mode of ITF which is mailing lists so

313
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,060
just something to consider sure sure

314
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,790
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian in the region something</font>

315
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,830
that helped us a lot was to have someone

316
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:27,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was already active in social media</font>

317
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,860
so Julia for Latin America has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

319
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,229
that it is related<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the ATF</font>

320
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,040
something we learned from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font>

321
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the of official or the formal</font>

322
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,600
arted something that it all always been

323
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,090
discussed is not something that's

324
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,939
written on stone it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that so</font>

325
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:52,540
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make mistakes and we</font>

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,840
correct them Rick that the brand<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

327
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:59,290

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,470
Central does that make sense yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

334
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">was the case in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Latin America was mainly</font>

343
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,179
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is twitter is</font>

344
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,800
definitely a channel but what I was

345
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,330
tasteless take a step back figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

346
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,550
who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reach and then figure</font>

347
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">out which channel actually works for</font>

348
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,440
that for that audience your google plus

349
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,090
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work with something else</font>

350
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,650
instagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what but sure</font>

351
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,070
just think about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience then</font>

352
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,230
decide the channel just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go little</font>

353
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,510
off-topic to the social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font>

354
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:05,080
which I think work very well in other

355
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,790
contexts is how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source do work</font>

356
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,520
like for example in open source they

357
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:11,710
have in stock of meetups in India and

358
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,780
they face the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they go all</font>

359
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,490
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world not everyone who's</font>

360
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,430
working in open source can travel but

361
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">they do make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have these</font>

362
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,690
meetups which is sort of officially

363
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:26,500
recognized even from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> openstack and</font>

364
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,150
odl and other cases so doing and they're

365
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,230
also sometimes specially in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OTL if</font>

366
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,360
you take an example they are

367
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:34,390
implementing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a protocol and if you</font>

368
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,760
want to hook<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with them and maybe one</font>

369
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,530
day have talked more related to IDF and

370
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,500
the protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> specification rather than</font>

371
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,420
just of the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think we</font>

372
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,550
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapt and stacie from the</font>

373
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,320
Bangalore and India concept we thought

374
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,129
the token source could be the right

375
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,290
channel to advertise ITF remote obsessed

376
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:55,040
let's

377
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:57,649
um yeah yeah in New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let yeah</font>

378
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,300
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> greg was Greg actually said sort of</font>

379
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I would say but I'll sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a sense</font>

380
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:04,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know for any of these remote</font>

381
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:05,930
hubs to work it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes back to</font>

382
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,639
having some kind of you know

383
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,110
communications plan around who are you

384
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,680
trying to reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how will you get to</font>

385
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:15,530
them and and you know twitter is great

386
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,840
and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually typically the</font>

387
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:20,240
success comes from multiple channels so

388
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,520
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's it's it's tweeting but it's</font>

389
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,070
also having a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook page it's having</font>

390
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,900
you know in some areas it's a presence

391
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,429
on google+ and some areas it might be a

392
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,160
presence in a you know might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting</font>

393
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,650
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group in we chat or line or</font>

394
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,960
whatsapp you know so there's a number of

395
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">different channels and ways that will</font>

396
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,740
need to be you know looked at for the

397
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,030
various different audiences you know in

398
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,540
in some parts of eastern europe there's

399
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:49,910
different services you know Russia has

400
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,260
its own some of its own social networks

401
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,010
and pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are there that may have</font>

402
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,730
wider space as<font color="#E5E5E5"> does China as other so it</font>

403
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:01,070
gets I don't know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to a</font>

404
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,510
I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get to a you</font>

405
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,189
no prescription other than to say that

406
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,660
you know groups that are local need to

407
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:09,320
be looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do they reach to those</font>

408
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:14,210
those the folks in that area and 2 i'm

409

sorry your name was<font color="#CCCCCC"> but ok so i mean to</font>

410
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,940
your point you know there are certainly

411
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,250
in many areas there's strong developer

412
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,390
groups to which was something we were

413
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,830
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in the context of the</font>

414
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,270
hackathon reaching out some of the

415
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,040
groups you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when we go to some of</font>

416
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,230
those areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also for the remote hubs</font>

417
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,520
it may be something to that some of the

418
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,910
developer groups the other place that

419
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,710
are out there may be other avenues so

420
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,020
but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind of that stage of</font>

421
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">i mean i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think to me it's part one is</font>

422
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,860
figuring out can we do a remote hub and

423
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,960
can we create the environment

424
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,580
infrastructure and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that second part</font>

425
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,050
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now that we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,920
second question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how can I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF</font>

432
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,120
centrally support hubs you know so

433
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,130
that's a different question

434
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,800
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wonder like like I'm i'm</font>

435
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:13,100
working with this pre bsd dude and he

436
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,379
goes to bsd can and so I mean you know

437
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,010
might it be interesting to have a boot

438
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF booth at like bsd can you know</font>

439
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,879
that's their conference because you know

440
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,580
a lot of people don't know or maybe we

441
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about there's people doing new</font>

442
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,100
development of new protocols maybe we go

443
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,440
talk at BST can we does that does that

444
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,929
make any sense to anybody I mean I'm not

445
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,120
I can't approve the money for it but you

446
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:45,020
feel a bit but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> might that be</font>

447
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:50,360
interesting oh sorry okay yeah oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

John<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're gonna be next for me this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

453
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:06,050
a little thunder<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco um I'm obviously</font>

454
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,600
all for remote hubs and telling people

455
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:12,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the ATF and reaching out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

456
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,939
everyone you want I think that that

457
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:18,290
without a very specific concrete plan on

458
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,928
what we want to do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

459
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:24,920
differentiate between what we do as

460
00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:27,470
individuals as living wherever as you

461
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:32,330
know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do and what the</font>

462
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:35,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF is doing meaning yeah there's a</font>

463
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,559
very fine line between an official IETF

464
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,820
activity and an informal meeting by all

465
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,760
these shops or informal meetings you

466
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,189
know one is even if people talk about

467
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,480
protocols and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and agree</font>

468
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,020
among themselves whether they like the

469
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,860
idea or not there's no consensus right

470
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:58,670
in the ITF sense so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

471
00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:03,080
an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'm sure the ATF as a</font>

472
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:06,160
whole wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things I just think we</font>

473
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need to be careful about that oh</font>

474
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes yeah okay I'll easy okay now do I</font>

475
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,780
just push this thing

476
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,730
John hi I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to make an</font>

477
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,420
observation along the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> lines as what</font>

478
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,690
was just said um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a very</font>

479
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">big difference between outreach to</font>

480
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:39,340
people about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and opportunities</font>

481
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">to learn about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF and actual</font>

482
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:47,560
remote participation the IETF and I

483
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:51,580
think the former is fine uh with regard

484
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:56,290
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latter I'm I'm very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font>

485
00:26:51,580 --> 00:27:00,070
about thoughts about social media they

486
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:03,250
do not create the right logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I note that</font>

487
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:05,679
knowing that the microphone has has

488
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:10,120
gotten up and made a one sentence or

489
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,580
market and sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and and many social</font>

490
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,909
media things we talked about including

491
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,740
Twitter are very very much extremely

492
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:22,360
short statement oriented rather than a

493
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:26,410
thoughtful analysis of an issue-oriented

494
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:30,040
uh the consensus comment which was just

495
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,090
made is all part of this so I'm still

496
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,350
not sure what you're trying to

497
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,889
accomplish but I think it's very

498
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to differentiate between more</font>

499
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:41,200
and better outreach and learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

500
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:44,230
the IETF and active participation in the

501
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:51,700
IETF although what is remote oh thank

502
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:53,980
you thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donny</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Bishop wanted to</font>

503
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,740
say something related with the promotion

504
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,450
and how we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that in</font>

505
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">delegation but it's also related to this</font>

506
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:07,180
part of the how formal they are yeah we

507
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:09,790
in luck we've been extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible on</font>

508
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:12,160
the foreman<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the wrong house so it's</font>

509
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:15,700
more what the local organizer wants

510
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:18,820
instead of what we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to do</font>

511
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:21,190
or what we recommend so in many cases

512
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:25,649
when they are organized in companies

513
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,650
they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

514
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:32,080
exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire CD of on regarding</font>

515
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">their house so the is up to them how</font>

516
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,769
they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the invitations live promotions</font>

517
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,029
a the some of them organized hubs and

518
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:41,649
they didn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be included</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

519
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,799
list because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were not able to</font>

520
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:48,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive people from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Maui company yeah</font>

521
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:53,158
and others they had no<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues from being</font>

522
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:55,389
on the list as long as we didn't over

523
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,809
promote the thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

524
00:28:55,389 --> 00:29:01,689
meeting room was small and in all of the

525
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:06,490
cases will let them do whatever they

526
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">want it to do because we so far it's not</font>

527
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,019
something official so the only thing we

528
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:14,490
want is for them to remote participate

529
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:18,820
in a more comfortable or or or

530
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:22,929
interesting way instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a having some</font>

531
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,389
sort of procedure or wherever Oh a point

532
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:29,529
back to John's point it's ours more

533
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:32,979
outreach oriented instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a GF</font>

534
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">process oriented sure sure yeah okay</font>

535
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,620
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> greg wood from internet society and</font>

536
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,230
I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to observe that I think</font>

537
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,580
the question you raised<font color="#CCCCCC"> nalini is really</font>

538
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:44,799
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> question but it's probably</font>

539
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,470
outside the scope of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conversation</font>

540
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:53,230
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF promotion generally is a</font>

541
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:57,009
really big topic uh but with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

542
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,960
hubs i think it probably follows the

543
00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:00,850
general approach that I've served sense

544
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,470
about ITF and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it aligns with</font>

545
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,269
what John was saying is that you know

546
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:06,549
you want to provide some small core

547
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:10,690
building blocks that people can adapt

548
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:12,250
and use in and leverage and figure out

549
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,450
what works for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're the</font>

550
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,000
people that they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attract</font>

551
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,879
the hubs<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya know I like the whole</font>

552
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,120
building blocks thing yeah you pay

553
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:25,240
ticket what you want yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rick Saul's</font>

554
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,370
like my um yeah I agree general outreach

555
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,309
is a bigger topic and we shouldn't talk

556
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it here um just also to mention we</font>

557
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,710
had a hub it's going on in Boston right

558
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">now westford</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

559
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">think on average they get about 10 to 15</font>

560
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,590
people

561

00:30:54,610 --> 00:31:00,990
reflect yeah okay no all right sure on

567
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:05,999

571
00:31:12,369 --> 00:31:19,570
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little involvement with the ITF</font>

572
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:22,389
it's yeah um so they had wanted

573
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:24,519
internally um to set up a video

574
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:26,498
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and and reserve it for</font>

575
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,690
the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> one room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the five days</font>

576
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:32,399
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their members could commit their</font>

577
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:34,809
staff could come in and out<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and then</font>

578
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,248
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened is just does that it</font>

579
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,820
happened just as that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was getting</font>

580
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:42,100
organized um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF hub</font>

581
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oscar mailing list yeah and so it became</font>

582
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:49,840
a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach out to other people</font>

583
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">um its focus so far has been on reaching</font>

584
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,340
out to people already know about the

585
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea for not bringing in new duel is mad</font>

586
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,490
but I think that's also probably a good

587
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:01,570
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also jumpstart other things but</font>

588
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:04,269
just get some of these other companies

589
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:07,720
um who have you know would like to send

590
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:08,740
more people but yeah yeah um and say hey

591
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,570
look why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you host one in your</font>

592
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,009
company and expect a few visitors to

593
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,379
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and they can register ahead of</font>

594
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:15,999
time and so on yeah i think the other

595
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones are also great and probably even</font>

596
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,049
more important to the vitality vitality

597
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:23,350
the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is a way to</font>

598
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:26,139
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also um if you've got</font>

599
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:30,399
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vers doing this stuff it</font>

600
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:31,840
might be more scented uh help work on

601
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,279
the tooling and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things easier</font>

602
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,928
because they'll know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they'll</font>

603
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,509
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference between there</font>

604
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:40,899
and remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> well gee we really need a</font>

605
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:43,600
better feed we need pumping of a push

606
00:32:40,899 --> 00:32:45,610
button whatever it is sure sure the

607
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,009
feedback loop<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important yeah</font>

608
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:52,689
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stay in New York and because</font>

609
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:53,059
I've been remote a number of times it's

610
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,980
why

611
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,389
I champion some of these things in

612
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">jabber and stuff like that and looking</font>

613
00:32:56,389 --> 00:33:00,918
at the list of who's there and seeing

614
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,590
Dave Crocker who is often at these<font color="#E5E5E5"> mics</font>

615
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,139
but I see him remote there and of course

616
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:07,549
John and on others who are tuning<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

617
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:09,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">this i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote experience</font>

618
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:11,690
certainly does make you realize how far

619
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,710
we've come but yet still how far we have

620
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:18,710
to go um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess my question for you to</font>

621
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:23,720
bring this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of on is is there an</font>

622
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:25,220
effort here to try to collect the case

623
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">laser information into some kind of</font>

624
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,639
forum or I know Christian you had the

625
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:30,740
document that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was there but like I I</font>

626
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:33,678
think of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mark rich no</font>

627
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,049
rich mentioned here out of Boston um I

628
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,970
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really interesting model</font>

629
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:42,740
to look at because if we did have some

630
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:45,080
kind of way to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to well hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that up</font>

631
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,330
as an example because for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

632
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety i HEV 96 it might interesting to</font>

633
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,220
go out to the IETF 95 attendees and say

634
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:54,919
hey did you enjoy you know did you enjoy

635
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">what happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last time well consider</font>

636
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:59,419
setting up know if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a video</font>

637
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:01,070
conferencing system or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> or even</font>

638
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:03,320
just a room with a projector you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

639
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:06,049
can you could you set this up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

640
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,279
company and then you know bring in

641
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,409
people in some of these areas because

642
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,418
you're right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if if juniper for</font>

643
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,669
instance has some people who want to

644
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:16,908
follow standards and they can't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

645
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:19,219
that ITF but if they could set up a room

646
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,869
to do that and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

647
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:24,230
look at you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you can establish</font>

648
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:26,300
that then you can look at how do you do

649
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,859
the outreach some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which can be social</font>

650
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,379
media some of which can be you know

651
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:32,810
groups like Internet Society chapters in

652
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:34,879
that area or region or developer groups

653
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,520
or other folks are in that area but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

654
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,040
get so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one question is you are is there</font>

655
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,259
an effort to capture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of this</font>

656
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,379
definitely I we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have we've put together</font>

657
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,079
to a two drafts and we've got a third

658
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:51,770
one under way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah yeah yeah I</font>

659
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,169
don't mean maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I weren't out posting</font>

660
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,950
to the right list I posted that all the

661
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:01,129
drafts to the IETF main list is there

662
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:03,169
some if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys ever else I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just let me</font>

663
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,010
know I can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf announced or I</font>

664
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what well</font>

665
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,810
I think you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably better at the I</font>

666
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,250
mean I'm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the V meatless so I've seen</font>

667
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,740
them I haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance to read all</font>

668
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,720
to be honest I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can do it</font>

669
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,000
certainly the main ITF list but I know

670
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume of mail there you know</font>

671
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,560
precludes many of us myself included

672
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,770
from reading it on any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ongoing</font>

673
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:28,190
basis we could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah well you</font>

674
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what um we did I novi meet you know</font>

675
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,860
we yep v me it might be a place that we

676
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,890
all can just go to and everybody can can

677
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,980
do that as I say we're we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

678
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:43,220
main one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Latin American one and</font>

679
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,380
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> from India were in process we</font>

680
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:48,259
are actually now or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

681
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,870
template I know I was yakking to rich

682
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,390
about you know i'll give you guys the

683
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,250
template and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys fill in like</font>

684
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,379
kind of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did I mean it template</font>

685
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,780
in the sense of this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history</font>

686
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,920
these were the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know various things</font>

687
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:06,830
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then as people come in and as</font>

688
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,080
we learn more for exactly the reason you

689
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:11,150
said for community mammary so we don't

690
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,730
have to reinvent the wheel off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

691
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:16,190
and fifty raptured but ya toda that

692
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:19,670
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> is underway and to John I would</font>

693
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:25,400
just say you're absolutely right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

694
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:26,600
world iya and pieces like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are we it</font>

695
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,520
sounds like we're dropping out we're

696
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,670
getting dropouts on here but so in this

697
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,560
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're certainly we are certainly</font>

698
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,890
in a world where things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

699
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,720
drilled down and you and myself Dave

700
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,540
Crocker some the others of us who tend

701
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,169
to write longer at times are always

702
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,360
being challenged to remedy but also to

703
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,940
the point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are saying there in all of</font>

704
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,840
the communications work that we do

705
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,490
certainly within the Internet's i knows

706
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of what we do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that space john</font>

707
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,629
is we try to use the social media others

708
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:58,280
to drive people back to places where we

709
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:59,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have longer documents and longer</font>

710
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,090
pieces where people can understand more

711
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,069
but there's a whole separate discussion

712
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,860
I think greg was right we need to split

713
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:09,110
the discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF promotion and</font>

714
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,210

716
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have a bond but really more of how</font>

717
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:17,180
do we how do we get these hubs going and

718
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,180

723
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:34,368
interesting things that's happening now

00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:36,380
of course is um<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh well Philippines I'd</font>

725
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:38,300
be real interested in exactly what stage

726
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,990
they're out but I'm in touch with a meal

727

730
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">Indonesia Philip Hammond she's got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

731
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:54,020

732
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:56,119
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is super interesting is</font>

733
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,270
Russia you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've been talking to the</font>

734
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,210
Russian people especially here and that

735
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,130
might be super<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and of course</font>

736
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,589
Africa is its own problem I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

737
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:09,710
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not only problem I mean</font>

738
00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:12,259
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> has their own issue every</font>

739
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:16,250
region so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

740
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:18,920
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to get down here is when</font>

741
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:21,859
you're starting up you know you guys are

742
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:24,200
on your way so like when we have the

743
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:26,240
conversation with Russia you know I've

744
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,480
kind of distilled from talking to you

745
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,049
guys like what seems to have worked and

746
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:36,140
it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that for all of you you</font>

747
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:38,900
guys had a first a leader a core group

748
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,629
it's a super hard to do this with one

749
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,720
person it's super hard I mean and so if

750
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have maybe three people at a minimum</font>

751
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,270
three people who are the core group of

752
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,970
leaders and then you know you can

753
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,530
balance each other so that well let me

754
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,109
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then let's get up in</font>

755
00:38:54,530 --> 00:39:00,200
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay other thing that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

756
00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:03,348
you guys have all done is work with the

757
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:06,740
you know whoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> your diaspora is you</font>

758
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:08,710
know um the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indian non-resident</font>

759
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,509
Indians the people in Latin you know or

760
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,230
wherever and that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been I think real</font>

761
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:18,650
helpful I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my sense of</font>

762
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:21,829
what's happened existing authors who are

763
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:25,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">either in country or again in the</font>

764
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:27,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">Diaspora having that those people come</font>

765
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:30,390
to meetings and nurture people that

766
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:33,960
seems to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been helpful um</font>

767
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:36,690
as support from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR and it I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">our wishes from Nick see that seems to</font>

770
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:45,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been um you know it real valuable</font>

771
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:48,450
to have that a support from<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sock</font>

772
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:51,839
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what it is and then support</font>

773
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,339
from IETF those<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so as I say again I'm</font>

774
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,099
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking like if I'm if I'm gonna</font>

775
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:58,078
talk to Russia I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> say guys look</font>

776
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,359
or there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gentleman here that we</font>

777
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,690
can maybe entice to starting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> hub in</font>

778
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:05,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kingdom and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so you know</font>

779
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,930
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are the kind of things</font>

780
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:12,240
you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider so comments</font>

781
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:14,038
hi I'm Elora rotana Cisco I'll just say

782
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really good list I</font>

783
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:19,680
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have titled that slide how to</font>

784
00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:21,538
sort of hug I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something</font>

785
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,910
out there and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say that is</font>

786
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:25,859
because many of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put there</font>

787
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,230
is what we started doing latin america

788
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:30,630
when we found out that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

789
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,539
coming to and sinus we started say we

790
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,190
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell people about the ATF and</font>

791
00:40:32,539 --> 00:40:38,789
one day we were walking down the street

792
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Brasilia and we said well wouldn't be</font>

793
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:42,839
nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people could attend all this</font>

794
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,519
stuff remote and how about if we start

795
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,049
talking to people and getting them in

796
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:48,868
their places so we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning the</font>

797
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:52,769
hubs um what I mean saying all this is

798
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:56,490
that we never had an objective to do

799
00:40:52,769 --> 00:40:58,140
house we had an objective to spread the

800
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,508
word<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the ATF and how to</font>

801
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,819
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it and what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal wit</font>

802
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">cetera right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then eventually in and</font>

803
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:07,920
yes we had local people we had people

804
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,140
who write brass we had people from the

805
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,519
region to live other places black live

806
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,828
did a lot of sport I<font color="#CCCCCC"> struck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

807
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">report we managed to convince people</font>

808
00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:18,059
from the ITA leadership and our place to

809
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:21,329
go down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to right to show their</font>

810
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:24,210
faces etc so all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

811
00:41:21,329 --> 00:41:26,250
because we wanted to do a hug right BB

812
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:29,819
and so the other nation I'm saying all

813
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is that the hub in Boston for</font>

814
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,390
example I

815
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:38,420
me that there's probably a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

816
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:40,280
current ITF participants there than any

817
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,799
of the hubs in<font color="#CCCCCC"> letting America together</font>

818
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:48,650
right and so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other words the the</font>

819
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:50,809
objective of that hub is different than

820
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,630
the other hunts right so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

821
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:56,420
they might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> need all this stuff</font>

822
00:41:52,630 --> 00:42:00,770
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they already self motivated to</font>

823
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:04,490
participate I talk now totally with job

824
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:07,220
you're pushy the list options that it's

825
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:10,520
it's a guy for us it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a afterthought</font>

826
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:12,410
it's never the objective yeah till I

827
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,030
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what you're really saying is</font>

828
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:20,779
like if I might is like this is actually

829
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:23,329
how to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF to a new region and</font>

830
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,069
the reason I say remote hubs is because

831
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can focus on it it's very</font>

832
00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:30,619
concrete and really what you're doing is

833
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:33,049
spreading the word about IETF and

834
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:35,809
getting more contributions from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

835
00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:37,790
area but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say oh we're</font>

836
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:39,260
building a hub it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> concrete</font>

837
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,750
that they can get their heads around

838
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,970
right the hub is is more of a result

839
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:47,180
after people know what the ATF is then

840
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,890
they go show up at up but otherwise I'm

841
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,960
not gonna go anywhere well let's say

842
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:54,230
know what I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go do right no no I</font>

843
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,569
know I beauticians like is it's a more

844
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:58,400
amorphous it's like spread the word

845
00:42:56,569 --> 00:43:00,770
about IETF and it's like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like</font>

846
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,660
well yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this talk and then</font>

847
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">people know but if you're gonna be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

848
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,170
well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having this remote hub it's</font>

849
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,339
like it's like you got you got a party

850
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this party</font>

851
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:11,540
everybody's invited and so then people

852
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,240
show up so it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut its a more</font>

853
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,549
concrete<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I'm</font>

854
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,529
making sense to anybody this is great

855
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:20,180
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet society yet God so the</font>

856
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,210
paradigm I have in my head is that the

857
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:25,490
hub is ax is a means towards an end and

858
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:28,819
it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the means that you can take</font>

859
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,549
towards that end and the actual specific

860
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:35,930
end may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different depending on where</font>

861
00:43:31,549 --> 00:43:37,520
you are so for Boston it's too but

862
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,348
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are already participating in</font>

863
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,060
the idea participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an idea that</font>

864
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:43,520
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveling to</font>

865
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,380
or Latin America might be introducing

866
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,950
people who have never participated in

867
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,270
IDF to the ITF generally so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

868
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,879
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually true a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

869
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">things here uh you know individual</font>

870
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,230
remote participation is again a means to

871
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,210
an end and that end might be different

872
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:01,460
so it's sort of a tool that's that's how

873
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:05,840
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it yeah yeah it all</font>

874
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:07,820
depends yeah Michael Mike Ackerman I

875
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,070
said a question on the last three

876
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:12,200
bullets exactly what does the word

877
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,790
support mean at least I would ask that

878
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,549
if I'm someone that's considering

879
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:18,590
starting a hub and of course as you're

880
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:21,170
smirking indicates one of those

881
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:24,500
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be is it financial in</font>

882
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:28,760
any way what if I can I mean lack Nick

883
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:32,870
you guys yeah work for isoka for

884
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:38,110
technique anyway and know that our

885
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:42,970
support or the things I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing I</font>

886
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:46,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">were we didn't provide any resource so</font>

887
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:49,850
we've been organizing them running the

888
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,279
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coordinating as ever said</font>

889
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:54,589
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that that Alvaro and</font>

890
00:44:52,280 --> 00:45:00,110
others have been doing to engage people

891
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:02,690
a bit a lot when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we announce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it they'll</font>

892
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">be the option to organize remote halves</font>

893
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:07,640
so they as they were already aware and

894
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,000
following certain working groups they

895
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:15,020
just filled the form and that that was

896
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,750
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them so our support was to make</font>

897
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:20,450
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things those tools that were</font>

898
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:23,000
required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize he they have</font>

899
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,189
surveillance and that was it they there

900
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">are there are no additional resources</font>

901
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:32,450
involved yeah maybe her if she can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Irish</font>

902
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:35,840
can talk from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick see ya our support in</font>

903
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the form of you know to provide the you</font>

904
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:43,310
know space and you know the coordination

905
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,190
basically and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but up before organizing</font>

906
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:50,360
the poor remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> herbs plea you can say</font>

907
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:53,700
pre<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF of you know training voltage</font>

908
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDF and also that they can understand</font>

909
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,890
you know the word days is happening

910
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:02,190
there so that is a basically

911
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:05,940
coordination not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interim in now not in</font>

912
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,890
the financial terms and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I think</font>

913
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's getting very because I'm as I said</font>

914
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:14,629
let me I'll take the case of um you know

915
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:18,480
one region that I'm working with their

916
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">rir is actually willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fund you know</font>

917
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,980
people to come over and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to their</font>

918
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,859
region which I actually support because

919
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:28,410
it's an under um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's a region we</font>

920
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,800
don't have very<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people from and so</font>

921
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,839
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally support that yes but</font>

922
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's probably different we have</font>

923
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,230
supported many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to region</font>

924
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,500
who to promote the share the IDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

925
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:46,770
engage it they get talks at universities

926
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:51,720
so but that was in advance<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

927
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:53,850
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF we tried to promote so we</font>

928
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:57,120
we've got a mailing list because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all</font>

929
00:46:53,850 --> 00:47:01,589
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> events and undies for those cases</font>

930
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:03,900
we reported funded they did browse for

931
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:06,810
those ID efforts that were willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

932
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:09,720
help us on that outreach but as we

933
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have the community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the remote</font>

934
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,779
has themselves with there was nothing

935
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:17,520
needed just the coordination right<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

936
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,610
and so but you know if you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

937
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,040
region that doesn't hasn't done any of

938
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,900
that we you know first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some I</font>

939
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,570
over you got paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> him use that</font>

940
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">mailing list yeah by the night yeah I</font>

941
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wanted to kind of add on to what</font>

942
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,560
Greg commented and what I'm hearing from

943
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack Nick community as well so I</font>

944
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:41,549
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in India we are actually doing</font>

945
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">haha using the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hub's as a dual purpose</font>

946
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:48,870
one is obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread awareness of</font>

947
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:50,250
the ITF in I see that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> latnok they</font>

948
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:53,940
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already done that why other</font>

949
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:56,220
channels and and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly for</font>

950
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,420
that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least in bangalore and</font>

951
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,709
some other cities we know they're

952
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,170
already communities that are

953
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:02,850
implementing standards but they don't

954
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:05,010
know that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually contribute</font>

955
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:06,480
to a standard so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has large community</font>

956
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,980
of developers like that

957
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,300
um and idea is that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is some</font>

958
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,420
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could channel them through the</font>

959
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:17,270
remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> hubs then they can understand</font>

960
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:19,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible for them to actually</font>

961
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,450
contribute to the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> why are the</font>

962
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:24,089
mailing list not necessarily transferred

963
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:26,700
comment as through eyes open source

964
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:28,800
contributions or why implementation

965
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:32,310
reference implementations<font color="#CCCCCC"> our comment on</font>

966
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,320
other drafts or attend remotely right so

967
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,420
this there's a huge amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose</font>

968
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,060
developer community that is doing all of

969
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:43,980
this work and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is today I believe</font>

970
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:46,080
extremely disconnected yeah so so so our

971
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:48,780
object is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> also to spread awareness</font>

972
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,310
which I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> latnok is doing through</font>

973
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,190
other means which is where there's a

974
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:58,020
little bit of difference um sure which

975
00:48:53,190 --> 00:49:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is region-specific sure sure in terms of</font>

976
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:03,660
support we are also planning a setup of

977
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,430
permanent hub with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nixie office with</font>

978
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,290
all the hardware's and all the

979
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:10,319
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> so buddy anybody could come</font>

980
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">in like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this room's it and see but is</font>

981
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,760
happening at the same time converse in

982
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,669
both the direction so that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

983
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,160
planning and it is about to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

984
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,010
will complete it within two or three

985
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">months that that's it that is a great</font>

986
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:28,400
segue that you know what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna okay</font>

987
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">a minute wait a little bit to something</font>

988
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:36,600
that is a great segue one of the other

989
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:40,170
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

990
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:43,650
there's two things that were starting in

991
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mentoring program and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the ideas</font>

992
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,740
actually came from the mentees

993
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:51,779
themselves not my ideas me know the

994
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:54,000
young people said we knew we would like

995
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,280
this and and if we can change the name

996
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,020
I'm just we just put out this name and

997
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:02,250
we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one we call preschool</font>

998
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:03,960
and basically the idea is is like people

999
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know how to you know they have an</font>

1000
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,690
idea is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard just if you've never</font>

1001
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,399
written a draft before to get start and

1002
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:14,220
get going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it you don't even know</font>

1003
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:17,490
maybe if your eye is is crazy you know

1004
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,950
it's if you have some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

1005
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working together is a lot easier</font>

1006
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:25,589
um and maybe even you get a the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> germ</font>

1007
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:27,750
of the idea you flesh it out talk to the

1008
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:30,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group chair whatever and say</font>

1009
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:33,270
it's worth following up but basically

1010
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,030
the idea is um we can just set up

1011
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:39,509
webinars you know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets you get</font>

1012
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:41,369
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two slides and you don't</font>

1013
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:44,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a draft you just talk about</font>

1014
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:46,980
your ideas you say I have an idea in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1015
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,800
ppm for this and you have to be you know

1016
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">state it pretty succinctly other people</font>

1017
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,700
are listening they have you have five

1018
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,430
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten minutes for questions and</font>

1019
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:59,879
then you can say sure sure I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1020
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:03,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea I'll be willing to be co-author so</font>

1021
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,210
then ideally at the end of it you form a

1022
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:09,570
team and then you guys go off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work</font>

1023
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:12,839
if you need a mentor to help you work on

1024
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:15,810
it great you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can find one for</font>

1025
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:18,180
you um but especially if you're saying

1026
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,680
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an ongoing system because you</font>

1027
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:21,779
know the whole thing with you know I'm

1028
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,569
yammering about webinar webinar<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1029
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,510
webinar that or is it can be hard to

1030
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:31,020
even get the connectivity to attend the

1031
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,460
webinar<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know um even Skype calls you</font>

1032
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:35,730
know I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do skype calls even</font>

1033
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:39,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe Europe sometimes you know it</font>

1034
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:42,150
fails it fails um and so so let me stop

1035
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:44,190
now and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know maybe because</font>

1036
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:46,589
what I'm thinking is of course will<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1037
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:50,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">be for you know i can send 295 first</font>

1038
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:53,549
timers 95 attendees you know so on um

1039
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:56,280
but will this be something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1040
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:57,900
remote hub can do you think it's

1041
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,210
interesting and do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think your people</font>

1042
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,280
you know people might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1043
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:07,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">joining such a webinar maybe once every</font>

1044
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,970
two months alone on cisco I would be

1045
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:13,049
very happy to attend all of those things

1046
00:52:08,970 --> 00:52:14,730
every so often of course i won't go to a

1047
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,670
removable to sit in my house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

1048
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:19,859
there now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this i think</font>

1049
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:22,079
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea we set up a</font>

1050
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:24,180
meaningless that we use in the region<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1051
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,359
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right ad hoc whenever you have</font>

1052
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,830
an idea just talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we've also</font>

1053
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:30,980
done

1054
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:34,819
several more formal events were in the

1055
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,320
third year this year in Brazil where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1056
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,460
have a full day workshop that we call

1057
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:42,800
the priagent workshop and Jimmy<font color="#CCCCCC"> D people</font>

1058
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,890
come they talk about stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a</font>

1059
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,950
post workshop committee that then can

1060
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:52,009
mentor the person and there's several

1061
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:56,930
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we brought over so I think</font>

1062
00:52:52,010 --> 00:53:01,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great idea I'm not sure how it</font>

1063
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:04,009
fits with the hubs but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a</font>

1064
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:05,960
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea think thank you the reason I</font>

1065
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it fits with hubs I mean it's it</font>

1066
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:10,700
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's open to everybody of</font>

1067
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,850
course you know any because you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1068
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:17,000
have a hub nearby and in some senses if

1069
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:19,549
you're isolated and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hub</font>

1070
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,770
nearby maybe that's even more valuable

1071
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:24,890
but I'm just thinking in terms of

1072
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:27,320
getting the word out to people to say

1073
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,390
such a thing is available because one of

1074
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:35,360
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is super super</font>

1075
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:38,480
valuable is not just finding people in

1076
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:42,890
your own area in your own region who

1077
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:46,370
think exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you maybe but but but</font>

1078
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:48,830
say okay we have collaboration with if

1079
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:53,049
somebody in bangalore with somebody in

1080
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">brasilia with somebody in you know in in</font>

1081
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">glasgow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you met from the webinar you</font>

1082
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:02,120
know and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say yeah I'm totally</font>

1083
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:04,040
interested in this idea for Sdn for

1084
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,670
example because then what you get is

1085
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:09,680
different perspectives it's and I I tell

1086
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:12,350
you for new<font color="#E5E5E5"> people what I'm trying to do</font>

1087
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,690
for in in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mentoring is break</font>

1088
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,060
down the barrier to entry there's some

1089
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:18,980
pretty huge barriers to entry and I've

1090
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,770
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kids who frankly are following</font>

1091
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:23,630
me around right now and saying when are

1092
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:26,780
you doing this you know because they

1093
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:30,620
they don't know how to get collaborators

1094
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:32,450
and and so up from their perspective I

1095
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:34,670
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'd</font>

1096
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:36,259
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see remote hubs you guys have</font>

1097
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:40,359
the mailing list of people who are

1098
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:43,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested that's what I'm think</font>

1099
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes what what I think that I will change</font>

1100
00:54:43,269 --> 00:54:49,720
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> halves is a component from</font>

1101
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:52,210
an oral project where the mailing list

1102
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,368
is an hour component and depressed cool

1103
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:58,089
couldn't be an hour component so they

1104
00:54:54,369 --> 00:55:00,220
are components of the outreach<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort</font>

1105
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:02,200
whatever we want to call it it's not

1106
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:05,200
that everything is related with the hubs

1107
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,939
perhaps it's just a small piece on and

1108
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,680
they can have the best school the

1109
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:11,529
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and the other are not the</font>

1110
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,999
house oh yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah no I get what</font>

1111
00:55:11,529 --> 00:55:15,069
you're saying it's like they're yeah

1112
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:18,249
they're really kind of disconnected

1113
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:21,099
issues they're both good ideas maybe but

1114
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:24,788
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really together yeah yeah maybe I'm</font>

1115
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:26,440
wrong yeah like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comedian I think I'm</font>

1116
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:28,869
gonna echo the same comment i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1117
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a fabulous idea and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish it would</font>

1118
00:55:28,869 --> 00:55:33,999
have been available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me to me a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

1119
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,980
two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago my question is whether or</font>

1120
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:38,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's out of scope for what we're</font>

1121
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:40,539
doing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe it doesn't even</font>

1122
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,430
belong there are effort too much than

1123
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:45,309
our chances of<font color="#E5E5E5"> succeeding perhaps</font>

1124
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:47,680
diminish sure not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only concern no no</font>

1125
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:50,319
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cody idea yeah yeah yeah I'm</font>

1126
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,598
totally up for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying yeah you</font>

1127
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:55,119
take that under mentoring and then leave

1128
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,730
it at that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally cool i mean if</font>

1129
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,589
people feel that way and I also wondered

1130
00:55:57,730 --> 00:56:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">an York I wonder about how it connects</font>

1131
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to what the edge you folks are doing in</font>

1132
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,970
the tutorial pieces and stuff well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1133
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:09,249
actually on the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> of committee when I</font>

1134
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,558
get a chance to attend but this is

1135
00:56:09,249 --> 00:56:13,808
different this is we're gonna well and

1136
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,180
well first let me tell you Miriam it I

1137
00:56:13,809 --> 00:56:17,499
mean we try to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I can't be egged</font>

1138
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,239
you on everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually on the</font>

1139
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:21,819
Edgar<font color="#E5E5E5"> Committee trip and we try to work</font>

1140
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:24,880
very very closely this is to write a

1141
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:28,480
draft this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tutorial this is</font>

1142
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,519
like I got a new idea for a DNS you know

1143
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,700
god knows what all you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean all I</font>

1144
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:34,779
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah so I guess then</font>

1145
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,058
I'll just talk about this here too i

1146
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:39,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">think those are excellent ideas and</font>

1147
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:40,690
things but yeah i would park that and

1148
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,390
say that's separate from the remote hub

1149
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:45,519
idea if the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to look at</font>

1150
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:48,640
how do we engage people in Rhode hubs

1151
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,348
during the actual ITF meetings to

1152
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,538
facilitate that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

1153
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:54,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus area that would be good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1154
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:56,050
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> focused on what</font>

1155
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,310
yeah well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what I might do I'm</font>

1156
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:00,490
get cuz these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be under</font>

1157
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:03,370
entering what i can do is i can email

1158
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:05,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys and say if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys would like</font>

1159
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to participate would like to publicize</font>

1160
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,810
the webinar that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF mentoring is</font>

1161
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,060
gonna have have at it but it is totally

1162
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:16,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">different thing is that sound right yeah</font>

1163
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okie dokie Greg Greg what internet</font>

1164
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:20,410
society complete outsider a newbie here

1165
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:23,110
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it I would just echo</font>

1166
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,730
with dan has said is that i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1167
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,650
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually from the outside</font>

1168
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:29,110
perspective someone who's new doesn't

1169
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,450
care what the source is but but once you

1170
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,830
understand a little bit it and to your

1171
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:34,359
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> nalini it'd be really good to be</font>

1172
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:37,480
super coordinate with the edgy team

1173
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:40,750
because their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter is to do exactly</font>

1174
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:43,960
what that sounds like really to help to

1175
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:46,990
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft together to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

1176
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">participants be more effective in the</font>

1177
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:51,370
work of the idea that's their draft so

1178
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:55,390
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Charter which I presumably</font>

1179
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">including running a draft so uh I mean I</font>

1180
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:59,109
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's turf wars here but I</font>

1181
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:03,280
think from an outside perspective it's

1182
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:04,840
just important to be a coordinated

1183
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,240
because it can get confusing otherwise

1184
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:09,040
well you know I actually wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> merge</font>

1185
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the the edge of team you you</font>

1186
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:15,279
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that whole chaos um I don't</font>

1187
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,530
know why we're not merged but but yeah

1188
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,950
totally if they want to run it in fact I

1189
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:22,780
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be happier frankly that's</font>

1190
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:24,700
another idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea</font>

1191
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,130
preschool again I have the same comments

1192
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:31,930
as are those that<font color="#E5E5E5"> item it fits with the</font>

1193
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:36,040
remote hub<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh what would be nice is our</font>

1194
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:41,940
to have like a starter pack um where

1195
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:41,940
people can we can directly like we do

1196
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:08,329
yeah yeah yeah no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I yeah yeah I like</font>

1197
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:13,690
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a getting started getting</font>

1198
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:18,170
started in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf guide something yeah</font>

1199
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:19,430
getting you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right we</font>

1200
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:21,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to this is mid-may we're getting a</font>

1201
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:36,109
little far afield here because it sounds

1202
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:41,900
like yeah this is one that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason i</font>

1203
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:47,058
bring up sister hubs is because for some

1204
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:49,430
of the newer hubs that are forming they

1205
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:51,259
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it I almost feel like</font>

1206
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,940
it's kind of like an adoptive hub thing

1207
00:59:51,259 --> 00:59:57,009
some of you guys who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more</font>

1208
00:59:52,940 --> 01:00:01,759
experienced and maybe who even have more

1209
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:03,499
experienced participants some some other

1210
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:06,230
regions of the world could use a little

1211
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:10,848
helping hand and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

1212
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:13,279
the reason I bring it in um yeah it's so

1213
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:14,989
I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think I mean and I</font>

1214
01:00:13,279 --> 01:00:19,160
don't know if it needs to be formal or

1215
01:00:14,989 --> 01:00:20,779
um it the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason i say formal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1216
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:27,499
cuz nobody likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could</font>

1217
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:29,509
use a helping hand a do I don't know I

1218
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:31,939
don't know I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> babble but it</font>

1219
01:00:29,509 --> 01:00:34,099
but you see what what kind of the things

1220
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:38,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to do is is kind of help</font>

1221
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:39,829
each other I think the first thing Dan

1222
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:42,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">York the first thing you need to do is</font>

1223
01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">get you know we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started to get hubs</font>

1224
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:48,558
going and right now this the stage is

1225
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:51,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know start to you know lay out</font>

1226
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,940
the ideas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what works for the plans</font>

1227
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,489
the drafts are out there start to

1228
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:58,730
encourage people to to create hubs and

1229
01:00:55,489 --> 01:01:01,150
it may be that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know is there a</font>

1230
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:05,090
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the leaders of</font>

1231
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:07,610
individual hubs is

1232
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:09,650
one of those yet well we we all are

1233
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:12,410
supposed to talk through<font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Meath we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1234
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:13,910
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up well but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what might make sense so</font>

1235
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,710
you can be the suggestion to go without

1236
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,259
one year yeah there's an identified

1237
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:20,570
leader for each hub so there's somebody

1238
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,970
for Boston for Bangalore for whatever

1239
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know each of the different areas you</font>

1240
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:28,490
know if you have those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1241
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:29,990
for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF 96 is coming up and so</font>

1242
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:32,810
for everybody who's going to do a hub

1243
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:34,250
you get them get the main contact or

1244
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,140
contacts I mean it can be whatever

1245
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">however</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are there get them</font>

1246
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,480
onto a mailing list where they can then

1247
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:42,529
be aware of what's coming up and

1248
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,020
potentially they can then share with

1249
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,090
each other what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing what's</font>

1250
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,520

01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:52,040
what's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> buona sera is doing and</font>

1252
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:54,890
share that information on that list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1253
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:57,170
then it also provides a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you or</font>

1254
01:01:54,890 --> 01:02:00,290
I mean whoever's kind of managing the

1255
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:02,450
hub program from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center part can be</font>

1256
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:04,250
able to reach out to those remote hubs

1257
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:07,009
and let them know I see Alexis here she

1258
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:09,530
could be able to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and email out to the</font>

1259
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:12,050
hubs and say hey we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing</font>

1260

1266
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,820
it out to the remote hubs and just make

1267

dekho will also have these particular

1270
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,370

1292
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,430
maybe they start to be the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

1293
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,770
virtue of their success they start to be

1294
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:37,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to advise other people about what</font>

1295
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:39,200
happens so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you early to</font>

1296
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:41,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">formalise i would say let it grow</font>

1297
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:45,618
organically but provides some mechanism

1298
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:48,650
the hub leaders can can be aware both a

1299
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:51,170
broadcast mechanism for but also a among

1300
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:53,270
each other and so like richest folks and

1301
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:55,819
say here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked for us I think</font>

1302
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:59,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great a remote hopefully a remote</font>

1303
01:03:55,819 --> 01:04:04,550
hub leaker list that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sound</font>

1304
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:06,589
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a idea yeah yes in our case we do</font>

1305
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:10,700
create that list for each meeting

1306
01:04:06,589 --> 01:04:13,430
because not all the previous scoffs

1307
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:16,339
always organize a new one we tried to

1308
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:22,848
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least and not send image to</font>

1309
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:25,790
everyone but a yes in our case as I said

1310
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Lord the hours are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple like</font>

1311
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:31,220
why there's no need to coach among them

1312
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:34,040
because yeah yeah yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends</font>

1313
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:38,328
on the hub yeah yeah so yeah but I agree

1316
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,319
good idea to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of list</font>
