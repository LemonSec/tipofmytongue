00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">veto no no it just I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:57,410
the

3
00:00:08,799 --> 00:01:01,940
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a minute this</font>

4
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:08,179
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five gip meeting site meeting IETF</font>

5
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:13,069
95 in buena side and this is the agenda

6
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:15,410
out there since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not officially</font>

7
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">chartered arranging we don't have to do</font>

8
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:21,380
any agenda bashing but if you have any

9
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,890
question on the agenda the times are of

10
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,568
course we try to impose<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the one we</font>

11
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,390
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do we cannot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like</font>

12
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:37,340
much mystic maybe you can exceed little

13
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:40,220
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everything is ok I guess there</font>

14
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:43,750
was a request<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the slide set after</font>

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the meeting we have all the slides and</font>

16
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,170
hopefully we can post it on the mailings

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,149
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the best way for us</font>

18
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:57,440
because we have no other place<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

19
00:01:53,149 --> 00:02:01,550
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about this lives just a you</font>

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,810
know listen and watch and then you're

21
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:11,120
going to have this lights after the

22
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:12,470
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the sign-up sheets are</font>

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
circulating around please write down

24
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:20,209
your name just for us it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,220
of you or the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is meaningless</font>

26
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,450
that i'm sure you guys

27
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,750

participants on the vehicle here and see

33
00:02:47,080 --> 00:03:13,820
so you can have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions from them</font>

no help us no no not this one no

39
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:42,349
let's see something that's hey today I'm

40
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:55,050
finally home ownership rate so until you

41
00:04:42,349 --> 00:05:36,900
use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little witch which made I'm here</font>

42
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:41,520
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I'm sorry for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking</font>

43
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,969
capsule Japs you know we refer to save

44
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,969
this fight

45
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:14,539
oh my my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shaitan navigon salute</font>

presenter personal rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> I lose focus</font>

47
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:50,180
no nation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we will go to the next</font>

48
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:56,300
presenter dark sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that I thing</font>

49
00:06:50,180 --> 00:07:11,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have you find the other one in the</font>

50
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:14,509
meantime this all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay okay yeah</font>

51
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:18,110
thanks for for coming so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

52
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:20,629
essentially a summary of a little

53
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,909
article i wrote the end of last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and</font>

54
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:26,389
then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden and discussion we had</font>

55
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:30,080
on a couple of mailing lists and it's

56
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,649
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> a a call that when we think</font>

57
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,779
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could possibly do in 5g</font>

58
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:38,240
really take a close look what's actually

59
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,789
wrong in today's networks and what can

60
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,809
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from the problems that we</font>

61
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:56,169
experiencing today next slide please<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

62
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:56,169
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment yeah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

63
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:07,090
ok so anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look into the</font>

64
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,370
textbook<font color="#E5E5E5"> how mobile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

65
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,530
today so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things like access</font>

66
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:14,350
network core network<font color="#E5E5E5"> application service</font>

67
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,520
user equipment and so on and then there

68
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,990
are a couple of protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font>

69
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,740
management and so on to make this work

70
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:23,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in practice we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot</font>

71
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of machinery but it's actually needed to</font>

72
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:32,340
provide useful service today and next

73
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:36,069
slide please for example and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you move on</font>

74
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,880
for example in a typical network

75
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:43,330
deployment you would see at least one TT

76
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,600
proxy if not more which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they deem</font>

77
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,300
necessary operators like to to have

78
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,740
better control of aggression control

79
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,760
loops next slide there's quite some

80
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,220
elaborate machinery for traffic

81
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,130
management so extracting<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time</font>

82
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:08,800
information from base stations radio

83
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:11,200
data and then using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for policing</font>

84
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:16,560
for example or other forms of traffic

85
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:20,800
control next slide they are definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

86
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,219
bunch of application optimizers so video

87
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">optimizes mainly that do things like</font>

88
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:32,200
transcoding next night keep going and so

89
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,660
so in the ITF people also have thought

90
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,760
about say how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to directly inform</font>

91
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,170
application servers better of what's

92
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,360
going on in the network so there's a

93
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,610
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> called mobile throughput</font>

94
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,010
guidance so you get a bit of the idea so

95
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,860
there's lots of stuff that is needed and

96
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,860
practice to provide a good performance

97
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:59,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addition of that cadet and as you</font>

98
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,900
know as soon you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot really roll out</font>

99
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,050
a major service today without CDN so

100
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,310
that's another say essential component

101
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that also needs to be considered when</font>

102
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,219
you talk about the big picture so

103
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:15,130
CDN today is mostly done by like having

104
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,390
big caches at<font color="#E5E5E5"> colocation points and so</font>

105
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,970
on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future there there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

106
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,650
definitely trends to move this deeper

107
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,190
down into the network so edge caching

108
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,300
these kind of things and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

109
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,980
essentially needed if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

110
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,439
like the upcoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> epic tation so</font>

111
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,450
blending video on demand and India TV

112
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,180
having a multicast like distribution

113
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:41,140
tree with that that's another thing that

114
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:44,109
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are adding on top and if you think</font>

115
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">about other applications so there s not</font>

116
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,120
only like the netflix<font color="#E5E5E5"> casters there's</font>

117
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Akamai their social networks there's a

118
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,220
danger<font color="#E5E5E5"> also that we have really arriving</font>

119
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:59,500
at a slightly complicated and also

120
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:03,070
siloed system in the end so couple of

121
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,170
activation so we today already we need a

122
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:09,280
significant amount of stuff to really

123
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:12,219
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work and so it has not</font>

124
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,010
only to disappear in performance but

125
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,970
that's one of the topics I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">loot here then tweeted in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today so</font>

127
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:25,240
caching is really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

128
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely going to increase question is so</font>

129
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,210
if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable new use cases so</font>

130
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,910
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> so called OTT applications what will</font>

131
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,740
that actually mean for a say useful and

132
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,209
manageable and network in the future and

133
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:44,650
so what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean for so if you look</font>

134
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:47,890
into the say published ng MN use cases

135
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:50,230
for 5g like a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

136
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,380
interesting and if you try to distill

137
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,380
the technical requirements for that so I

138
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,740
only picked like to hear so if you want

139
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:01,390
to cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> send the network's tactile</font>

140
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,210
internet so super low latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

141
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to really think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

142
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do for performance so optimized</font>

143
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,580
forwarding for all these different kinds

144

147
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,460
really think about security and user

148
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,030
privacy and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topic we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

149
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,670

about her<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and for security so I</font>

151
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,900
mean we are I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe to say</font>

152
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may she be too is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

153
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,770
Tuesday and it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

154
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,540
have more encryption in the network and

155
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,870
on the other hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll creates quite</font>

156
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,370
some headaches or for operators that

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,380
have been used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use all this machine</font>

159
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,780
layer optimizations and so on to provide

160
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,819
better performance this all becomes more

161
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,800
difficult now at least or more expensive

162
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,800
and so we will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about other</font>

163
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,520
mechanisms do that so we are partly

164
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,740
doing this so there's an a record of em

165
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:11,680
this week that it's taking some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

166
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but its arch over nothing</font>

167
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,699
regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is so when we say TLS</font>

168
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,980
it's often<font color="#CCCCCC"> like sold as providing better</font>

169
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:24,520
user privacy because your connections

170
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,530
are encrypted in fact what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,480
not normally that your connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

172
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,280
next CDN cash is encrypted and what

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,270
happens after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually beyond</font>

174
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:37,209
your control so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you can assume</font>

175
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:40,390
so Akamai probably will encrypt the next

<font color="#E5E5E5">stop as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well but what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to attend</font>

177
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:48,670
the cloud so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course by no</font>

178
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:51,210
means protected and so our<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLS or</font>

179
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,380
channel based encryption service today

180
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,870
yeah protects the connection but not

181
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:59,220
really the end user data so that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

182
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:06,010
no control no ways to authorize that

184
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:13,870
six minutes magnets so and the other

185
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:16,150
topic is so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address all</font>

186
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,700
these say demanding use cases it would

187
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:22,030
be probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to implement this</font>

188
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,620
was like<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP as is today so these</font>

different control loop Conservation's

190
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,960
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an effective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution to</font>

191
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,820
extend the use of TV proxies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

192
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's a road nobody wants to go</font>

193
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,379
down

00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:41,329
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network of proxies doesn't really</font>

195
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:43,669
sound convincing so what I want to do

196
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:47,149
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose an a kind of explain it a</font>

197
00:14:43,669 --> 00:14:50,269
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail in my my article is to</font>

198
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,999
think about more say additional

199
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:56,259
forwarding layer functions that could

200
00:14:52,999 --> 00:15:00,229
help in covering all these heterogeneous

201
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:01,899
network links so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> enabling</font>

202
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:03,949
local regions version in some cases

203
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,429
enabling a simple form of cash in

204
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:13,269
without requiring the full C n

205
00:15:06,429 --> 00:15:21,829
complexity so that's like one<font color="#E5E5E5"> IBM didn't</font>

206
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:24,739
and ok ok that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right i got i think</font>

207
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,679
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're interesting feedback on this</font>

208
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:29,179
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also on this slide but so if we</font>

209
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:35,829
have time later like that we can go back

210
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:35,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this ok ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions under</font>

211
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:42,439
quickly when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron like Kevin Smith</font>

212
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vodafone as so my take on this is that</font>

213
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:47,899
really the major problem is the lack of

214
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:50,389
harmony between the radio layers and TCP

215
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:51,859
flow and congestion controls if we can

216
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,149
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right together we probably</font>

217
00:15:51,859 --> 00:16:00,229
won't need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp proxies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until yeah</font>

218
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,970
hopefully I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I am so one of</font>

219
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:05,329
the things that it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

220
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:07,309
estates I mean there's lots of say<font color="#CCCCCC"> aqm</font>

221
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:11,118
technology that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really deployed</font>

222
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:13,879
right now so that could be helpful to

223
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:15,350
improve end-to-end performance for tcp

224
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:17,839
you know what sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one of the</font>

225
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:22,399
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I got funding from people</font>

226
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,279
yeah thank you hi my name is Padma care

227
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,069
snow um I have a question specifically

228
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,769
about the hop by hop forwarding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

229
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:33,919
mentioned right um the reason why is

230
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:38,350
because i really think that pork us and

231
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:41,869
eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize routing how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

232
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,179
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to work with help i hope i</font>

233
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:47,720
think there should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> other mechanisms</font>

234
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,470
on top of that right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean this</font>

235
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

236
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:56,630
certainly a like like future-oriented

237
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:59,810
say proposal so but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work</font>

238
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:04,550
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example in the ICN community on like</font>

239
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:06,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">full balance and so i hope i hope</font>

240
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:11,000
congestion control so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

241
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:14,690
basically that you enable the forwarding

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,380
layer or you provide better visibility

243
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:21,010
for the for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for nigga hoped so for</font>

244
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:26,180
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network regarding</font>

245
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:28,910
latency to your next stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example so</font>

246
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,620
this can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done if you have a bit more</font>

247
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:36,200
visibility of say so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN did kind of</font>

248
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,620
request names for example and match that

249
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,390
to your different outgoing faces and so

250
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can achieve better performance</font>

251
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,290
of course it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

252
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:49,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do directly today without modifying</font>

253
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:51,889
the network on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean so</font>

254
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked a lot about slicing in 5g and</font>

255
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,760
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and software-defined networks</font>

256
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,750
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not that these things</font>

257
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,160
are totally impossible or say really

258
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,040
expensive to implement so you can

259
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,070
experiment with things today and so

260
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:13,340
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are building and software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alters</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">its color that i have in line is about</font>

263
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,660
section continuity I don't see how we

264
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,060
can do that with hop-by-hop especially

265
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,330
with the latency of sub-millisecond so

266
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:30,290
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just working this out um I would</font>

267
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:31,939
like to understand how yeah I wouldn't

268
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,830
take me at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> another five minutes to</font>

269
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I mean it's you actually can make</font>

270
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like multi management much easier</font>

271
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,919
because if you are thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like a</font>

in next generation core development so

285
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,800
one of the major challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for next</font>

286
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:59,150

of devices and you diversity of devices

288
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:04,520
so devices have different communication

289
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:08,120
patterns mobility patterns I'm a power

290
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:10,940
constraints some are not so um this

291
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,070
brief presentation is about how can we

292
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,630
be smart and providing connectivity and

293
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,590
maintaining connectivity for these

294
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:22,070
devices joint effort means there is a

295
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:24,050
European project it's an industry

296
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:27,669
collaboration project running I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

297
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:32,690
slide on that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group of</font>

I will come to that later it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

300
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:42,370
intro I keep the five minutes that were

301
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:45,170
um to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tackle these these challenges so</font>

302
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,229
various cases are being discussed for 5g

303
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,880
including io te machine chap devices

308
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,530

309
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,600
proceed with this one um and then

310
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,830
mission-critical devices which have even

311
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,659
more constrained on bandwidth and

312
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,080
reliable communication so for machine

313
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,659

314
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,210

317
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:29,210
have a stationary device you may need

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,250
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is called today paging</font>

319
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,140

320
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,230
up right in case it needs to be

321
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,630
reachable some Sanders they wake up

322
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,669
periodically and send a measure and

323
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,940

324
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:48,049
to reach ability so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how</font>

325
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to tackle all these different challenges</font>

326
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,700
and devices about her to heterogeneity

327
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,490
not only heterogeneity in<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices but</font>

328
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,340
also heterogeneity in different access

329
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:02,210
networks how to manage these resources

330
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,769
and how to because sufficient on some of

331
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,990
the enabling technology is being

332
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:08,360
discussed is<font color="#E5E5E5"> network slicing which is</font>

333
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,700
mainly a group of network functions

334
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,820
being isolated from other one so that

335
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,610
eases network management separation of

336
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,010
control data plane separation of

337
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,289
locators from identifiers there is a lot

338
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,799
of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> also going on the ITF which may</font>

339
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:28,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">be relevant here so how can we be smart</font>

341
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:37,039

342
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:40,690
how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smart we identify there</font>

343
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,950
are various device with diverse

communication patterns mobility patterns

345
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:49,340
energy constraints and also capabilities

346
00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,679
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of context information</font>

347
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,649
being available what we have today is

348
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,899
subscription context we can find out

349
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:59,029
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the device capability it's</font>

350
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:01,399
about profile information maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

351
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">only mount references being sent from</font>

352
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:05,199
the device or the subscriber to the

353
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">network can be taking into account</font>

354
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,029
statistics can be taken here so we have

355
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:13,639
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information available of a</font>

356
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:16,730
particular device about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service</font>

357
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:20,750
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expected service</font>

358
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,820
behind so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smart so we have</font>

359
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,580
two categories identified the one is

360
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,200
selection so<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainly a choice from</font>

361
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,928
available resources we have

362
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,799
different isolated control plane slices

363
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:37,370
and data plane slices we can select<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

364
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:40,019
this set maybe a large set of small set

365
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,719
and then how to peer control and data

366
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,970
plane slices so we may have a one-to-one

367
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,669
relationship between one control<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font>

368
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,440
data plane slide or I want to end so one

369
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,409
control brain slice can drive if

370
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,570
multiple data plane slightly after

371
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,130
selection of the slides we need to pick

372
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,289
the particular network functions which

373
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:00,090
we need that can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane</font>

374
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:02,299
anchor on the data plane can be dead

375
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">obtained anchors which basically</font>

376
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:08,850
determine the path of the data traffic

377
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:11,610
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that selection we can perform</font>

378
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuration the configuration means</font>

379
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:15,899
the setup and use of only the required

380
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:18,360
resources not a default set of states

381
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:21,779
and resources but tailor it to the

382
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,990
devices needs so what all the devices

383
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:26,340
need is connectivity so that's a base in

384
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,490
fundamental requirement for other

385
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,399
devices otherwise they would attach

386
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,130
everything else which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> today default</font>

387
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:37,439
which is location tracking reach ability

388
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">handover optimization IP address</font>

389
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,649
continuity can be made as a service so

390
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">we add this on top of the connectivity</font>

391
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:49,018
and in that sense create<font color="#CCCCCC"> States under</font>

392
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:53,940
control plane and data plane only if

393
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:56,669
required next one so as I said there is

394
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:00,149
a currently industry collaboration

395
00:24:56,669 --> 00:25:03,860
project running in Europe which is

396
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:06,120
called conflict control of 5g networks

397
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,899
so the main objective<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

398
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,279
convergence and being excess agnostic so

399
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:13,110
I have a common control plane in the

400
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,179
core that drives multiple access

401
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:20,428
networks um functional modularity so

402
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:22,309
intention here is to not stick to 4G but

403
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:26,340
to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more disruptive in</font>

404
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:28,440
addressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> new or defining a new work</font>

405
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,049
functional architecture and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

406
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,230
the modular way which allows you to pre

407
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:36,210
design control plane slices as there is

408
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,309
neat so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified different</font>

409
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,860
functional elements for connectivity

410
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,920
management mobility management<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

30 in excess transition context

413
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,880
awareness is a very fundamental part to

414
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">an able smart selection and smart</font>

415
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,090
configuration of control and data so

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,920
this activity runs actually as a regular

417
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,290
European project we have work packages

418
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,240
about use cases requirements functional

419
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,909
architecture and then about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

420
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,510
solutions one of the key aspects is to

421
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,550
specify solutions for smart connectivity

422
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:11,980
plan is to evaluate and prototype this

423
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,280
dissemination and standards impact is

424
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,800
very fundamental and 3gpp also onf<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,310
can ask you with us correct

00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:42,340
have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweat finally I'm sorry I my I</font>

434
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:46,980
had lost my network connectivity that

435
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:51,159
was the reason you will give me problems

438
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:04,570
the gaps in ipe transport for the 5g

requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right ok we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that 5g</font>

440
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,639
brings a lot of new requirements from on

441
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,120
the transport network basically the most

442
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:17,170
important ones are list here like a low

443
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,070
latency large bandwidth networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> lycée</font>

444
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:23,170
and the programmability so we need to

445
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,439
identify whether the IP transport

446
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:32,710
network today has some gaps in this

447
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:36,670
areas ok so for the low latency we know

448
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,890
in 5g services some of them will require

449
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:41,920
ultra-low latency liked for the front

450
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:45,460
hall CPI transportation that will

451
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,530
require 100 microseconds delay in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

452
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,860
transport and for the mission-critical

453
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:55,090
IOT services it's typically the delay

454
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:58,000
can be afforded is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 milliseconds</font>

455
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:02,199
and which means if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use IP</font>

456
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:06,720

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how to pour compounding the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ports to</font>

00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,930
want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a state statistic</font>

challenging for the IP transport this

490
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,149
one the network slicing is a very

491
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,860
popular and hot topic recently which

492
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,290
means the 5g will provide

493
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:15,010
diversified services seeing the same

494
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:18,790
single infrastructure so for the

495
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:23,379
transport it means each slice need to

496
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:28,270
provide a different trend transportation

497
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:30,490
service which including the different a

498
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,520
topology requirement and then maybe

499
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:36,400
different slides will require different

500
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:40,720
forwarding paradigms and the different

501
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">queue as parameters like lost delay</font>

502
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,390
jitter and bandwidth also for different

503
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:50,770
services they have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement</font>

504
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:53,500
on the reliability so we have a question

505
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:55,809
on this part is kenzie existing vision

506
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,470
technologies meet the network's

507
00:30:55,809 --> 00:31:05,290
licensing requirements in the transport

508
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:07,720
and the analysis my email phone ringing

509
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:11,379
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this part we need to have more</font>

510
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Modi investigation is that</font>

511
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:17,070
especially for the any topology

512
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:19,899
connectivity and for the service

513
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,700
resource management maybe there's still

514
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:25,570
some gap in the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vivian</font>

515
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:29,020
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for the</font>

516
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:32,350
programmability is mentioned a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

517
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:35,740
the white papers that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will require</font>

518
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:40,030
the stn for the other program ability of

519
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:42,730
the network and to do we have the

520
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,309
distributed network today and it is not

521
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,200
quite likely that a tidy transport

522
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:50,649
network will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be become totally</font>

523
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,380
centralized control so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

524
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:56,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to find the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> balance between the</font>

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,770

functions to meet the to learn to

527
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,450

requirement in the flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

530
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,418
scalability which means we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

531
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,000
consider both the North Mountain

532

interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> source phone interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and as</font>

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">well as the signaling and control plane</font>

534
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,470
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the East and the West</font>

535
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,879
so for the next step I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

536
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:32,020
work further on identifying the missing

537
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,050
gaps in this area and also a not analyze

538
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:46,330
and discuss potential mechanism to fill

539
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:47,770
these gaps one question Eric not mark

540
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,870
just a clarifying question you said

541
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,850
different forwarding paradigms on the

542
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:55,330
slicing so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually mean</font>

543
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:58,120
yeah what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean is some nitrous last</font>

544
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,280
may require later three IP forwarding

545
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:02,969
some may require later to forwarding or

546
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,920
some name because even none IP

547
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,950
forwarding hard times like what is

548
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,580
called i c'n or something what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours</font>

549
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:15,190
yeah yeah yeahs information-centric

550
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:18,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">networker so there's a lot of</font>

551
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:41,050
flexibility you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet all these</font>

552
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:44,678
requirements in the same network we

553
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">prepared the dark a couple of slides as</font>

554
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,340
we want to show it as a as an overview

555
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:57,309
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened in the on the</font>

556
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:03,120
mailing list we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been discussing</font>

557
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:08,969
many things and one issue that wisdom

558
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:11,679
raised was we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplify layering</font>

559
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:14,408
someone I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the President on the</font>

560
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:19,540
mailing list so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplify the</font>

561
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:23,919
earring because inherently special

562
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:26,918
invite us that works we have a lot of

563
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:31,569
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer that are being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used and</font>

564
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:34,310
they close I could long packets like mac

565
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:39,280
and IP header rows and so on

566
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:48,500
so are here what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> being used today and</font>

567
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:56,690
I what is being used today for example

568
00:34:48,500 --> 00:35:03,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the esky side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all day then in the 53</font>

569
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:06,680
areum<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can have so basically the</font>

570
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:14,570
FI if I in future internet architecture

571
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:16,700
and so a simplify this to only three

572
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,790
layers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side the bank and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

573
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,060
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the transport layer so on the</font>

574
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:26,779
user side and then the servers then the

575
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:28,759
network can only be three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years three</font>

576
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">three layers in the Playstations and</font>

577
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrapped and so and ready access</font>

578
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:46,009
specifically are only limited to the

579
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:51,710
lower too late now this is another

580
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:55,850
proposal more sophisticated again am

581
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:59,780
based on this narrow waist idea narrow

582
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:01,339
waist IP but you can fish in the wood is

583
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,030
it going to be the end result is going

584
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,940
to be so narrow waist but so all these

585
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,680
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we need we need to add in</font>

586
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,840
order to satisfy the five key

587
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,210
requirements to the IP layer and then

588
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:17,450
linked a rather later than that change

589
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:19,550
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about leaving</font>

590
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,770
shortly either from the so-called

591
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:23,930
mobility first project that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

592
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:28,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">conducted in in some universities in</font>

593
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">llame in America and they completely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

594
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of last year so they came up</font>

595
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,770
with several interesting ideas and some

596
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:41,240
of them they<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to work out some detail</font>

597
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:44,509
but it could be that for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

598
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:48,069
look into these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and then maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

599
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:51,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get ideas for some feature work</font>

600
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:56,369
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> group if if people are</font>

601
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:58,959
interested in because basically our

602
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:04,509
attention I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think should be since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

603
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:07,569
generation ID is this I p AF and so what

604
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:11,170
what is going to look like IP layer in

605
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:13,359
the future in the 5g networks so then

606
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:17,319
these types of things we see in there

607
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,749
and the IP layer in the data plane and

608
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:30,190
then control plane these are things with

609
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:33,129
you so now next<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and then again this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IL</font>

610
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:36,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">MP identified</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> locator network protocol</font>

611
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:40,619
has been discussed very shortly and also

612
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was discussed on the list and then</font>

613
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:47,640
Cameron binds I don't know any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

614
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:52,569
know him is from telenovela t-mobile and

615
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,910
an ITF crime he contacts us offline and

616
00:37:52,569 --> 00:38:00,219
he suggested this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> LMP is a good</font>

617
00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:03,729
direction to go so we made up few slides

618
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:13,930
about lmp2 into just interview and then

619
00:38:03,729 --> 00:38:16,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">I noticed that he had a draft is there I</font>

620
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,979
think he is presenting interior

621
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:23,259
afternoon about the LNP so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked him</font>

622
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to this session just because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

623
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:29,499
have we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about Olympia so</font>

624
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,209
I'll MP is I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I identified</font>

625
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:34,959
locator for a pony<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project was</font>

626
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:42,269
finished in 2012 four years ago in the

627
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:48,598
routing area<font color="#CCCCCC"> idra ire research I I group</font>

628
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:56,198
I our idea what what you call our ritm

629
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:59,140
something yeah so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was all</font>

630
00:38:56,199 --> 00:39:00,930
published in a series of RFC's like

631
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,520
eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine 10 fc's</font>

632
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,160
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more work going on in</font>

633
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,339
research dark contacted them maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

634
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,920
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it later very shortly now</font>

635
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the idea is very simple we</font>

636
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an identifier and allocate a</font>

637
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,920
separate and then this similar police

638
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:21,569
idea then I think they started this

639
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,099
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then discontinued in some</font>

640
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:29,099
other way so the approach here is

641
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,619
different from list in the sense that

642
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:34,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I LMP does not modify the routing</font>

643
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:38,790
system and it's completely compatible

644
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:41,660
with IP with ipv4 and ipv6 mp4 version

645
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:44,730
was defined ipv6 version was defined and

646
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:47,339
some modifications here and that Alex

647
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Alex plane what is modified post is</font>

648
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:55,290
modified of course then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see MPL I have</font>

649
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">are modified and Venus flavor so it's</font>

650
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:01,880
very limited modification to the current

651
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:06,118
IP life so so we can see that IP layer

652
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,010
modification required here normal

653
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,990
discussion to IP multicast and no

654
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:13,970
modifications routing system so

655
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:17,490
basically the transport layer keeps

656
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,770
identifier look local identifier and

657
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,640
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier in the state so this</font>

658
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:27,809
way when your address or locator changes

659
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,359
so the session doesn't break because

660
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:31,890
it's based on your look at your

661
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:36,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier and identified is very simple</font>

662
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:39,690
is the EU i-64 formatted some node name

663
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:43,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it's called more likely an ID or</font>

664
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:45,540
they didn't fight and then located in IP

665
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,260
subnet work that they noticed though the

666
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:52,770
interface is in so like the network

667
00:40:49,260 --> 00:41:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix network routing prefix associated</font>

668
00:40:52,770 --> 00:41:02,309
with that sub network so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now I</font>

669
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,970
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to talk very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long about these</font>

670
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:10,040
things button it's a yeah someone

671
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:12,819
comment so we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> tomm Herbert</font>

672
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:15,310
yeah thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

673
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:18,040
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on something very</font>

674
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:21,940
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> il NP identifier locator</font>

675
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,820
addressing the differences so it's

676
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,450
basically a 64-bit locator 64-bit

677
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:32,740
identifier like I LNP unlike I LNP it

678
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:36,480
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> require yep the same doesn't</font>

679
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:39,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">require changes to TCP which we like and</font>

680
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,280
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have implemented this for</font>

681
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:45,460
data center ability have not thought too

682
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,970
much about the more general context I

683
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:51,520
can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it but it's kind</font>

684
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,910
of like I LMP best way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it I</font>

685
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,170
LNP but a real manifestation of it so we

686
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,569
actually have implementation and

687
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,180
starting an appointment of it thank you

688
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:03,820
i think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> your experience is very</font>

689
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,160
valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have contributed</font>

690
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:08,530
more maybe if you continue on this in

691
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">distraction just least you're a teeny</font>

692
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:14,560
will be so and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing will be</font>

693
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:20,830
presenting ila<font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday crowding working</font>

694
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:21,970
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> are twg ok now ens changes and of</font>

695
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,370
course you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define all these</font>

696
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,779
things and then put they define these

697
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:28,390
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and then they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

698
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:33,490
supported by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server that</font>

699
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:35,529
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are contacting basically you give</font>

700
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:40,569
them the identifier you get the locator

701
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:44,490
so that type of normally say fqdn but

702
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:49,440
then with this they change the

703
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:52,209
identifier nie then get a locator for

704
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:56,380
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> north you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking the others</font>

705
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:58,360
of afternoon then so the host sending

706
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,490
packets to the correspondent<font color="#CCCCCC"> not CN is</font>

707
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,910
corresponding not so what does it how

708
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:07,540
does it work I think it's pretty simple

709
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:11,040
now how so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're most</font>

710
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:14,320
main interest was the host mobility

711
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,910
multi-homing support and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

712
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,080
didn't include multiple mean discussion

713
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:22,509
here the horse movie stream is and

714
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically two things every time the</font>

715
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,230
earth moves we need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a locator</font>

716
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:31,030
update

717
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:34,990
the message icmp v4 or v6 located update

718
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:38,109
message the horse sense that as you

719
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:42,850
messages to all the corresponding so

720
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:46,480
then the year and then is a dynamic dns

721
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,920
update muscles so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is what</font>

722
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,080
something that they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid in</font>

723
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,720
at least so they decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the</font>

724
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">routers routing system and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes it</font>

725
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:59,069
more difficult to deploy so why are we

726
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in this because then the</font>

727
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:06,520
first of all the other is only<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobility</font>

728
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:09,580
of issue of 5g<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMP compared to with Lisp</font>

729
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,859
is easier to deploy and Cameron been

730
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:16,509
suggested to work on 3gpp specific

731
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:18,609
issues 45 cm ability using I LMP so

732
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,790
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason we got into this and</font>

733
00:44:18,609 --> 00:44:23,980
then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepared this light so it looks</font>

734
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:26,529
like if you if you want to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

735
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,760
3gpp maybe you need some changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

736
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:32,410
current ILM people so that is something

737
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:38,020
we can look into if developers

738
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:44,020
interested and dark concession<font color="#E5E5E5"> II he was</font>

739
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:46,060
not really yeah yeah but I did not talk

740
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,560
in detail to himself I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he will</font>

741
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:50,020
contribute to the list further one and

742
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:52,060
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then discuss there so it's not</font>

743
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,280
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than I that I know this one</font>

744
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:55,990
thing they say I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no</font>

745
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,450
socket interface doesn't change with

746
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:01,140
this so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a that's an</font>

747
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:07,480
important result that they got through

748
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:14,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay next is the mobility first slides</font>

749
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:17,730
having a flashy I if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can cut any time</font>

750
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:20,470
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so this is explaining what</font>

751
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:30,280
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed before what those things</font>

752
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:32,560
are like a like generous global name is

753
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:38,369
a global name resolution service and

754
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,369
then name was it NCS

755
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,720
so similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but that they're</font>

756
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:47,450
defining more globally unique flat

757
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,339
identifiers EU ID and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> below the</font>

758
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:55,460
resolution service which should be very

759
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:56,870
quick to resolve these some nice idea

760
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,820
then you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> post this thing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

761
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:01,520
in the internet actually I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

762
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:07,130
this life so they're all public domain

763
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:11,930
document so so basically the idea is to

764
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep these extensions in some name this</font>

765
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:19,730
header in the pdu but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part is</font>

766
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:23,690
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current ipv4 or ipv6 doesn't</font>

767
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:27,350
change they try to not the chain similar

768
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:31,280
things in di<font color="#CCCCCC"> di LMP they put into the</font>

769
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:34,069
optional optional earth and tv6

770
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,570
extension headers and so that's the idea

771
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:51,980
to not disturb the current routing and

772
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:55,700
forwarding here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now so we have this</font>

773
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is slides the other one is</font>

774
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:03,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> storage area I think on this one</font>

775
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:08,720
this passion for word processing in the

776
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:10,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">router there is this segmented segment</font>

777
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,609
talking I think it's being done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

778
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,380
inner<font color="#E5E5E5"> eco-friendly segment working group</font>

779
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:21,110
is working on that these two doctors

780
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:25,700
have storage and then you can you can do

781
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:28,280
hope I off from transfer of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ohio</font>

782
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:30,439
transport example the whole movie can be

783
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,200
transported this way in the routing

784
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:38,180
system and this is currently going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

785
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,439
unity of segments working group so some

786
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,339
of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are being implemented</font>

787
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,800
and then context-aware delivery this is

788
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,950
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting idea basically you</font>

789
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:52,070
want to address things<font color="#E5E5E5"> them with the</font>

790
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:56,720
context like all taxis in Buenos Aires

791
00:47:52,070 --> 00:48:01,460
or all taxis in and around Hilton things

792
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:05,509
like that so so with these context could

793
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:10,640
be like geographic<font color="#CCCCCC"> coordinates and first</font>

794
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hispanic so then convert these tools on</font>

795
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,540
your global name resolution service to

796
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:19,400
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> EU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID and then some multicast</font>

797
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:22,340
convert into some transport mechanism

798
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,160
and then this can be processing Network

799
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:29,810
i think is a great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to be</font>

800
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:32,960
worked out for different<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP layer type</font>

801
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of changes ok so this move is the first</font>

802
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,130
and then what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do many this is</font>

803
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,950
many issues in 5g not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie theme</font>

804
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:45,820
and many new directions like TNS and she

805
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:48,470
has named certification services and

806
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:52,040
sorry radar thing as i said is already

807
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:54,740
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess in deep in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a etf somewhere</font>

808
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:59,779
then on text content and context

809
00:48:54,740 --> 00:49:04,729
delivery but these are the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

810
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can look into more in on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

811
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:12,680
discuss and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully in the coming</font>

812
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:15,170
months and maybe next year sometime we

813
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:23,540
can find them a good subject and go for

814
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:26,870
a bar far this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our aim so when</font>

815
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:29,720
do couch<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm so i'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how to</font>

816
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:32,390
articulate this best but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font>

817
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:34,990
it's a very good use of our time when we

818
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:38,210
kind of jump into very specific

819
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:42,279
potential solutions from a bunch of

820
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:45,290
research projects without really having

821
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,730
discussed like design goals architecture

822
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:49,160
let alone having some common

823
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:51,650
understanding about that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure</font>

824
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,609
how helpful this release at this point

825
00:49:51,650 --> 00:50:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I want to be impolite but and I'm</font>

826
00:49:55,610 --> 00:50:02,680
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure Michael if shot</font>

827
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,450
have a clarifying question so at the

828
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,029
very beginning of your presentation you

829
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:09,609
showed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> architecture proposals and</font>

830
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:11,860
both of them you have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one</font>

831
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,960
you said it's a next-generation IP and

832
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,300
the other one that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like I</font>

833
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,790
p<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus mentioned in the architecture so</font>

834
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,590
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just clarify what's that is it</font>

835
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:25,029
still IP or is it something that will

836
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:26,650
replace IP here here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something</font>

837
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:30,490
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-generation IP and on the</font>

838
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:32,920
previous one there is I p plus mentioned

839
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:36,640
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wondering what's that yeah</font>

840
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:39,460
yes clear a few plus yes this means that

841
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">candies in the IP layer was is for that</font>

842
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,710
feature internet architecture FIA this

843
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:47,080
is the time they use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in the</font>

844
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:51,820
literature reviewers project yeah we

845
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:53,319
still have IP across all the changes

846
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:58,270
that we had that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned for example</font>

847
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:01,000
DNS changes icmp extensions those are

848
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:03,940
the sidekick plus like you know I killer

849
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:09,610
the blonde criteria actually play your

850
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:11,850
favorite video but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other project</font>

851
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:15,220
introduces more changes a bigger see

852
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:17,710
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis dream kind of another's</font>

853
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:20,709
uc3m so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a clarifying question of</font>

854
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,110
the day goal of the meeting itself my

855
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:27,160
understanding was that the goal of this

856
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:31,240
effort was to identify some issues that

857
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,859
Phi Z may may bring and related to ATF

858
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:35,319
and try to identify those issues and

859
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:38,860
then to identifying which working groups

860
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:41,800
those issues maybe taco not thinking of

861
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:44,920
both but first<font color="#CCCCCC"> in defined the gaps</font>

862
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,290
whether there is room already in in IDF

863
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,210
and and then start<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on those so</font>

864
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:53,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my understanding and if that's</font>

865
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:54,640
correct so how we can progress to get

866
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,380
there because I and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I thing is</font>

867
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,170
not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy SSID but I think that that</font>

868
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:03,900
will be the useful yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

869
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:07,000
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the issue is to scope better so</font>

870
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:10,570
like we we have an you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know many</font>

871
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,880
proposed I think who dirt talked about

872
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:14,140
congestion control which is more like

873
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,650
transport layer so

874
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:20,078
here we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do more ideal air</font>

875
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:22,869
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so by significant consequences in</font>

876
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,089
control of people are are interested so

877
00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:28,900
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I mean these guys have that</font>

878
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:33,599
aim that we can go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP layer</font>

879
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,599
and still find the good things to do

880
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nygren I one of the things that</font>

881
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:43,539
jumped out at me a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oh eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nygren</font>

882
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:45,250
on Eric<font color="#CCCCCC"> nygren um one thing that jumped</font>

883
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,539
out as a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides seem to be</font>

884
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,279
on the let's just throw away<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

885
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,839
architecture of the internet and come up

886
00:52:48,279 --> 00:52:52,269
with something whole new of new from

887
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:55,058
scratch it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a lot of</font>

888
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:57,879
that which it where I wonder why there's

889
00:52:55,059 --> 00:53:00,460
not more of a focus on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font>

890
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,599
forget about ipv4 we move on from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

891
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,970
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not try to deal with any</font>

892
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,920
compatibility for that other than as a

893
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,649
service over ipv6 but for everything

894
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forwards just look figure out what</font>

895
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:14,799
are really the problems we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

896
00:53:10,599 --> 00:53:17,529
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to terminate server IP</font>

897
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:19,210
connections to user equipment deeper in

898
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:20,589
the network rather than having to go

899
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:23,500
through centralized p gateways like it

900
00:53:20,589 --> 00:53:24,880
seems like if we could do that that and

901
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,650
just figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what are some of the</font>

902
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,049
changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing protocols that</font>

903
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:31,210
we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the there's</font>

904
00:53:29,049 --> 00:53:33,279
less of a throw everything away and more

905
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,720
of um and then it becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

906
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:36,220
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we need to</font>

907
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,500
do to focus on the mobility<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff or</font>

908
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">which are the bits of the congestion</font>

909
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,279
control that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go change in</font>

910
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,869
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the existing framework</font>

911
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:47,160
rather than starting from scratch with a

912
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:49,990
whole new framework so you sorry

913
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,029
anything that the you're suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

914
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:54,549
we should more look be revolutionary and

915
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think more i think more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm making a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little sketch i think more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

917
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:01,930
seems like being more evolutionary maze

918
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:03,099
is no like these look most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

919
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:05,710
here looks completely and totally

920
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:08,710
revolutionary<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a a throw everything</font>

921
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:11,859
away start from scratch like if rather

922
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:16,650
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evolutionary which is is ok we</font>

923
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:19,119
have we today we have effectively on

924
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:21,190
ipv4 and ipv6 a lot of the mobile

925
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,470
networks are now really<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploying ipv6</font>

926
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,789
to the point where we're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a path to</font>

927
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:27,609
being able to not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

928
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:29,860
the ipv4 other than for legacy stuff

929
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:33,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even that ipv6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continent</font>

930
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,590

00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,299
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet something that in a place</font>

932
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,710
it's far away from where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> handset is</font>

933
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,840
it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets tunneled over some</font>

934
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,880
other some other protocols before it

935
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,710
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> there how do we move that like if</font>

936
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,930
we focus more on how do we move that

937
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,250
closer to the edge which i think is what

938
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,859
some of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cameron was trying to</font>

939
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,450
propose what you're talking I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you</font>

940
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,180
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been talking about with is</font>

941
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:57,310
like trying to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP the same trying</font>

942
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually just keep IP the same but</font>

943
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,299
focus more on what changes you we need

944
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:04,180
for congestion control what changes we

945
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,450
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the routing side what things can</font>

946
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:09,480
we do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make multihoming work better</font>

947
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:13,029
what are ways we can hook better into

948
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,410
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns or DNS for being able to</font>

949
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:17,110
handle some of the load balancing

950
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,490
mapping situations better than then it's

951
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:21,670
something that becomes a more tractable

952
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:23,919
problem to solve with you with kind of

953
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">with existing real world situations I'm</font>

954
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,430
relieving a problem understanding your

955
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:30,129
your proposal because I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

956
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:32,200
this is what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing here all these</font>

00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes especially I NLP is basically</font>

958
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,930
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolutionary approach so small</font>

959
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:39,610
changes and I think some of it is it's a

960
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:41,740
bit but<font color="#CCCCCC"> still even an island pier look</font>

961
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,630
when you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the do well</font>

962
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:45,069
let's just replace TCP with something

963
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,900
slightly different to require kernel

964
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:49,240
level changes everywhere you start

965
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,240
getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the realm of things that</font>

966
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,069
take a really that that are very hard to

967
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,089
actually practically roll out like this

968
00:55:54,070 --> 00:56:00,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the the side of a a kind of from</font>

00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:02,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content delivery operator side just</font>

970
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:06,009
seeing how hard it's been to get to the

971
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:09,580
from type just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get from to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font>

974
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,790
narrow hourglass less you change the

975
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:20,380
easier it is to roll out<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks a lot</font>

976
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:23,290
yeah I have to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi I'm Natasha</font>

977
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,810
Rooney and so I was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font>

978
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:28,120
slide and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that we</font>

979
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:31,870
were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with the output of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

982
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,540
week is to promote more people in telco

983
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:41,359
space to create drafts based on some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

984
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,808
these problems

985
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,609
so the presentations fantastic but if

986
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:49,220
you write this up as some sort of

987
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:50,930
informational document in an ITF format

988
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:54,140
that would be beneficial to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

989
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:56,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and my personal viewpoint on the</font>

990
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,910
congestion yeah that's a good point we

991
00:56:56,029 --> 00:57:01,009
need to write yeah I and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

992
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:03,739
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of that myself actually so it's</font>

993
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:05,450
a reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> to myself to and the other</font>

994
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:07,759
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that with the regards the</font>

995
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:09,950
congestion controls stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still feel</font>

996
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:11,960
that that exists perhaps in existing

997
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,489
groups or new groups that might come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

998
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,220
or new work that might come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

999
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:19,489
court rather than in here and this is

1000
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:21,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">more 5gn IP so I i think it probably</font>

1001
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:24,529
needs to be more focused towards the IP

1002
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:27,170
stuff and in the presentations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only</font>

1003
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:29,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">saw one real clear reference to a piece</font>

1004
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:33,710
of work which was the aisle MP piece of

1005
00:57:29,869 --> 00:57:35,569
work the rest seems to be suggested sort

1006
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:37,640
of ideas of things that we could look at

1007
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:39,288
which seems too cool for something more

1008
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,779
than you know jumping straight into

1009
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,369
doing work but gathering more people

1010
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:45,890
around in a bar before<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

1011
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:47,480
that I'm not sold myself my hopes are

1012
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:49,069
this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1013
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,509
their kind of requirements of stuff

1014
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:53,349
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> come through on the internet the</font>

1015
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:56,630
week of perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring to the 5g space um</font>

1016
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:59,329
but that hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really coalesced I guess</font>

1017
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:01,430
um but yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my commander thank</font>

1018
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:03,799
you I think I suggest said you put these

1019
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:08,029
things into a mailing list and maybe try

1020
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:10,099
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers a better more better</font>

1021
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:12,259
discussion later they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all appreciate</font>

1022
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:14,710
that actually for everybody who asked

1023
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:17,960
questions that if you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1024
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:20,799
discussion threads on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list nothing</font>

1025
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:24,170
let's go to help us a lot yeah so so I

1026
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,210
Eric Nam<font color="#CCCCCC"> marquee on so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that at</font>

1027
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:27,859
least I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so there's some</font>

1028
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,599
high-level problems that have been

1029
00:58:27,859 --> 00:58:32,029
described that people want to solve in

1030
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,829
the 5g space but I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

1031
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to sort of drill down into those</font>

1032
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:38,119
a bit more and understand those problems

1033
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,710
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and there might be some of</font>

1034
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:42,259
them may I understand better than others

1035
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:44,480
but but what what motivates these things

1036
00:58:42,259 --> 00:58:46,670
that people are proposing because then

1037
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,440
we can see do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have IETF technology</font>

1038
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:51,319
that already applies her work that's

1039
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:54,430
underway etc because right now if you

1040
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:57,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough information to</font>

1041
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">I what kill me what's already there all</font>

1042
00:58:57,309 --> 00:59:01,839
right what is it just an educational

1043
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:06,868
problem that all we have this piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

1044
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:11,078
here you can just go use it thank you

1045
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:13,809
Tom Tom Herbert again so I agree mostly

1046
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:15,760
with evolutions better than revolution

1047
00:59:13,809 --> 00:59:17,920
but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font>

1048
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,170
needs to be addressed and was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1049
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,710
alluded to and the since we're

1050
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:26,800
encrypting packets we're losing

1051
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:28,270
information and this is specifically for

1052
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,430
forwarding and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's kind of a</font>

1053
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:32,500
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's an architectural</font>

1054
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,808
flaw or why but speaking from the end

1055
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">house we never really think of</font>

1056
00:59:33,809 --> 00:59:41,500
forwarding as using definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

1057
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:45,040
payload or TCP header is even and it

1058
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:48,400
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice if and somehow this work</font>

1059
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,660
became more protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gnostic so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1060
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,900
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed something in the</font>

1061
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:55,690
forwarding paths that is related to say

1062
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:58,119
the transport layer put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that into l3</font>

1063
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:00,790
information somehow so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the</font>

1064
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:02,890
day if forwarding would just be layer 3

1065
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:04,270
and we use a light information that

1066
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:07,598
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and I actually think ipv6</font>

1067
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:14,470
has some nice hooks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

1068
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:16,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this anyway sis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patnem so</font>

1069
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:18,459
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1070
01:00:16,299 --> 01:00:20,859
have been saying and I i came to agree

1071
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:23,680
with eric is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1072
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:26,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of requirements and some of those</font>

1073
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:29,169
proposals of those architectures need to

1074
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:31,390
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> assessed and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> refined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think</font>

1075
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a one solution that fits all</font>

1076
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:38,319
the requirements of 5g in any of them so

1077
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:41,950
I really encourage that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1078
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:44,259
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirement and like you just</font>

1079
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:46,629
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me borrow pieces that we know</font>

1080
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:48,700
work maybe but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think that we</font>

1081
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:50,980
have a ready solution we can just say

1082
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:55,210
jump on that one and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working right</font>

1083
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:57,549
now thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>
