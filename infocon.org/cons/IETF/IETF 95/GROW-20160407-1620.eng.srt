whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to present the other</font>

18
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,849
draft sorry I didn't catch that was must

19
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,819
beat we have the filtering threats stuff

20
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,829
is often editor q roughly problem

21
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,260
definition is often editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q as well or</font>

22
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,170
no sorry it's a nice guy HD evaluation

23
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,649
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF last call now what I</font>

24
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,649
understand

25
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:08,810
gee shut is waiting as it has always

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,510
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting on the last bit but it</font>

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:13,730
anyway I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> what thoughts about our</font>

28
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">psl via has recently expired and i think</font>

29
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,959
we're waiting on an update from Joe

30
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:23,959
who's not here this week beach we reject

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,480
00 still need some discussion on on some

32
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,500
comments and so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr t add pads i</font>

33
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,649
think mr t<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,049
positive review group adoptions so we

35
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,860
should spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some time looking at that</font>

36
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:42,799
making progress the routing policy

37
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:45,019
considerations is off as an RFC thanks

38
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,260
to the iesg folks and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two</font>

39
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:52,790
drafts grow BMP is an editor q finally

40
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:58,160
along with route server operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

41
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,510
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two other presentations oh we</font>

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,370
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jabber scribe in a note sticker</font>

43
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,780
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can restart me back up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

44
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:12,920
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgot is there someone who</font>

45
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:16,988
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take notes John's got his</font>

46
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,599
hands full so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't and no tools</font>

47
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">rüdiger know you could take notes just</font>

48
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:28,700
very quick all right anybody else I

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,050
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I can't use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

50
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:37,469
threat of not starting all right notes

51
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:44,640
jabber

52
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:46,050
no great we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just write down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

53
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,250
what you think happened and email the

54
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,320
chairs at the end will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great grow</font>

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:05:04,110
dash chairs at a tip that order and then

56
00:04:49,320 --> 00:05:09,260
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a jabber escribe still can keep</font>

57
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:21,240
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess ruger you know Jabbar oh</font>

58
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:28,760
come on that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse oh no one</font>

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:30,900
wants to Jeff Jarrett Wright come on

60
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,940
because I can make my laptop do it but

61
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,940
it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard for everybody else yes</font>

62
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,380
that's fine if it's not perfectly Iger

63
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,570
we can keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

64
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,540
right I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll call that good</font>

65
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:54,479
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i said this stuff we</font>

66
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:58,340
talked about the draft status all those

67
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now we're back to presentations</font>

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,650
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot who's okay great</font>

69
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:28,169
where where are the blue sheets oh

70
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:48,929
they're going around Gordon word

71

72
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:57,180
telecom yet today's topic is now

73
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:00,600
something new it relates you some

74
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,100
scenarios we<font color="#E5E5E5"> family of ease including</font>

choose different website to ice P just

which you have choice on insurance for

inbound traffic but I CP may choose to

probably be such attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect</font>

270

this pass so another that<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiated</font>

271
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:58,159

classification mechanism the policy

275
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,389
decision procedure and the last one is

276
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:15,350
the negotiating mechanism between the

can summarize that for the native<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

ended the traffic scheduling mechanism

continue to collect more requirements in

288
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:04,129
teacher Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Joely egli so I see</font>

289
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,070
that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting set of</font>

290
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,760
requirements I think one of the

291
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:13,310
observations I would make is that I've

292
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen these requirements before in some</font>

293
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">places in many cases I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are</font>

294
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,420
components that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have as requirements</font>

295
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:28,490
that are actually kind of impossible and

296
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:31,580
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have some concerns that</font>

297
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:35,510
translating those requirements into into

298
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:39,939
functions is a bit problematic in

299
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:41,720
particularly with requests to a

300
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,940
scheduling

301
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,860
that with fine granularity like a lot of

302
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:53,600
scheduling that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has these long feedback</font>

303
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:57,770
loops um results in a tendency to

304
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,689
polarize your traffic ie the one that

305
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best right now is it going to be</font>

306
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,540
the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks best in 200</font>

307
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,149
milliseconds when you put all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

308
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,440
traffic on there and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden the</font>

309
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,420
other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be idle and</font>

310
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,250
those will look<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until they</font>

311
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:15,910
get traffic on them and that can result

312
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:18,050
in a nice tight feedback loop that

313
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:29,600
alternates between a lot and no

314
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:41,000
performance yeah yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah it's</font>

315
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:42,080
an excellent robot hi Chris um so a lot

316
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,690
of your presentation seems to me like

317
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,929
you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do software-defined</font>

318
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:53,840
networking didn't say that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

319
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:56,360
you could do if with the right set of no

320
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,399
stay on its own with the right set of

321
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,820
computation you could do what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

322
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,920
to do in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network right but it means</font>

323
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,240
a bunch of SDN stuff has to happen a

324
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,820
bunch of interfaces to all the routers

325
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:10,040
all the I to RS businesses to happen

326
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,280
like there's a bunch of heavy lifting to

327
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,840
happen before you could do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

328
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve some problems that the</font>

329
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,970
drill points out but I mean that it

330
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,970
seems like it's a sort of an SDN<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

331
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,169
so I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control I just want to</font>

332
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,680
comment on the control system that you

333
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:33,800
need to do oh sorry I'm Peter Lawford ah

334
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,990
the control system f is you have a PID

335
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:41,540
regulator and in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

336
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:45,680
infinite gain and no dampening and it's

337
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:48,139
proven<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be unstable um and so it</font>

338
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,330
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do the reason</font>

339
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,800
traffic if you try to find the math who

340
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,270
you look at all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that do</font>

341
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,320
traffic engineering with their<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite</font>

342
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,418
traffic engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

343
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,740
you try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what they're</font>

344
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:59,690
actually doing and you end up finding

345
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,539
that well what they're doing is they're

346
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:04,639
inserting a delay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control loop</font>

347
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,700
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random generator that's the human</font>

348
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:10,399
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the math for most traffic engineering</font>

349
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:15,799
cases is it sad the delay and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random</font>

350
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:17,479
generator yeah and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jolie egg</font>

351
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:19,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">league and this is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

352
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,039
actually model kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in our own</font>

353
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems with respect to load balancing</font>

354
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,220
between pops is what is the difference

355
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:30,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">between doing it I random which has a</font>

356
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,149
tendency to result in something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

357
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:35,360
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an even distribution at least</font>

358
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,459
at very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale and actually making</font>

359
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,799
decisions which turns out to be much

360
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:47,629
harder um so particularly if it's if

361
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:50,929
it's about working around resource

362
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:53,350
constraints<font color="#E5E5E5"> um that are imposed by other</font>

363
00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:55,909
parties that has a tendency to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it</font>

364
00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:00,740
another sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deep game theory</font>

365
00:24:55,909 --> 00:25:02,720
exercise because the other party is also

366
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,029
working around some constraints with

367
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,129
respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their posture to you and so</font>

368
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:11,029
you're actually engaged in traffic

369
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:15,408
engineering arms race um and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

370
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:24,139
are things that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get fed into</font>

371
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:26,659
models and I they they contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

372
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:31,250
set of irreducible complexities that are

373
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:33,529
hard to engineer out of this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

374
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a gun if what you're trying to</font>

375
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:37,730
achieve is that slide that says gold

376
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,959
bronze and silver service you can

377
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:44,029
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by are introduced you</font>

378
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,460
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by actually doing edge</font>

379
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:49,009
functions delay drop you introduce the

380
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,960
crappiness at the edge for the gold<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

381
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,210
the gold people has less crappiness than

382
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,279
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grunch people and then you add up</font>

383
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> statistics some of those traffic's</font>

384
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,990
and then that's that's your size of your

385
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,428
back home and no now everybody get

386
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,559
exactly what they paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and you don't</font>

387
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:05,860
need to sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send the traffic</font>

388
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,860
around

389
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maria for a while okay evil Peter</font>

390
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Peter's assumption is that you throw</font>

391
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,450
sufficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> over-provisioning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

392
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,360
game so that while okay actually you

393
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:31,210
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> high quality and no problems from</font>

394
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:37,240
the start and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peters game works not</font>

395
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:41,020
not ever no well okay not not everybody

396
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:45,040
has sufficient resources in all the

397
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:48,220
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time but having</font>

398
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:52,000
sufficient resources is something that

399
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:55,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">can not be emulated by any magic if you</font>

400
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,350
don't have sufficient resources so kind

401
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:05,889
of my question would be how much spare

402
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:11,199
capacity or how much overloading is in

403
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:15,250
your is in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set if you are</font>

404
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,820
running at five five percent spare

405
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:22,270
capacity in the complete network for

406
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:27,000
half of a day you cannot do good quality

407
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:36,040
service or even even even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tired</font>

408
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:43,590
service by any means of control and well

409
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can afford a serious serious</font>

410
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:51,030
spare capacity which of course is also

411
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed for securing against failures</font>

412
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:59,139
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

413
00:27:54,370 --> 00:28:03,399
I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think Peters notion of</font>

414
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:07,800
well okay delaying delaying computations

415
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:12,309
and tuning of unit tuning of parameters

416
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:14,680
actually works in an extreme example it

417
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:16,899
might work like well okay you measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

418
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,750
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure for a week and figure out</font>

419
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:23,230
what the main problems in the load

420
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:25,809
versus the capacity are and you compute

421
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:29,530
and you compute the best distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

422
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:34,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">fo and for the next week you are at</font>

423
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:34,290
least approximating a good distribution

424
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:46,840
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're really in from Java</font>

425
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,210
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanical Jane how can we schedule</font>

426
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:59,800
flows automatically with fine

427
00:28:49,210 --> 00:29:09,990
granularity details yeah I know yeah you

428
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:12,760
guys are concerned of the oral<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

429
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:16,330
understand what do you worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one</font>

430
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:18,970
is performance another<font color="#E5E5E5"> is maybe the</font>

the requirements next time so uh we're

we're out of time so I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about this it</font>

490
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:37,749
actually created a whole bunch of

491
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion on the middle list I think</font>

492
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:42,100
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't really explain the</font>

493
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">intent of what we were doing about the</font>

494
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,748
mechanism so the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing the changes</font>

495
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:48,928
between then and now are mostly clearing

496
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:51,159
up exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this is intended to be</font>

497
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:55,240
in fact from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last discussion that we</font>

498
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:58,869
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC 7789 resultant out of that</font>

499
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,649
which talks about potential effects of

500
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:04,240
filtering in the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

501
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:05,739
read that i receive talks about the fact

502
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,570
that if you filter some things that may

503
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,480
affect some Wells's policies for example

504
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:12,730
any of those true the intent of this of

505
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,359
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is an optional</font>

506
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:17,840
mechanism it's there in green it should

507
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:20,569
be in red and make

508
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,930
whatever an optional mechanism to remove

509
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,340
a prefix without overlaps we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

510
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:29,540
there are people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in their</font>

511
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:32,480
network for whatever reason and all

512
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,270
we're specifying here as a mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

513
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,639
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maybe automate that in your</font>

514
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,860
network again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not intended for</font>

515
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,330
internet white deployment we're not

516
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,060
saying everyone should go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this</font>

517
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,909
on everywhere we're not recommending

518
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:50,060
people to filter anything we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

519
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:52,460
saying if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already filtering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

520
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,350
may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this mechanism instead</font>

521
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:59,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> manually going to put filters</font>

522
00:34:54,350 --> 00:35:01,910
everywhere so with the objective of not

523
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:06,529
getting any spam about the q6 examples

524
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:09,500
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TAC example and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

525
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,780
other shows is somebody else on here

526
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is heaven as in two runs one long</font>

527
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:18,140
route in one short route they're

528
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:20,750
overlapping runs and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy's</font>

529
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,120
advertises this long on the short up

530
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,910
this way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the long run the other</font>

531
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,130
way so what happens is of course 6403

532
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:32,690
gets all the routes from everyone else

533
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that 6503 wants to go this</font>

534
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,260
way because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy maybe they</font>

535
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,960
make the decision that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

536
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">filter the more specific route that</font>

537
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,790
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change their dynamic over the</font>

538
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,870
network right they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going down</font>

539
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,540
this way because that's what they

540
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,980
decided to do and in fact in this

541
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,990
example and I know the intern is

542
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,880
obviously more comfier than this the

543
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,029
guys behind him don't see a change

544
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,290
either right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would come this</font>

545
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,630
way he would make a decision to go down

546
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:04,160
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way and that's it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go all the</font>

547
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:07,130
way down the line and great so again

548
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is intended to be the case where</font>

549
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:13,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably already filtering like</font>

550
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:16,930
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you may want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I'll me</font>

551
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:19,220
that oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some terminology there is</font>

552
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,819
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> call an overlapping route which</font>

553
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:25,490
is a longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> route and the maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

554
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:28,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">agree or whatever your advertising your</font>

555
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:31,470
block is the covering ground so when you

556
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:35,220
go read the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what it says</font>

557
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:37,740
we use the term the term bounded and all

558
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,480
this means is we're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

559
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,890
community that we use which is a normal

560
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,920
community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put and define</font>

561
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:46,500
yourself in your network the intent is

562
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if we're going to filter the</font>

563
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,340
overlapping around and you bound you

564
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,869
retain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route in your network that's</font>

565
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,840
the intent of bounty right for you two

566
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:00,510
to bound the propagation around and then

567
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:03,359
in the draft we talk about fully

568
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:06,619
overlapping so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means basically</font>

569
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,109
is that if you receive the route from

570
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">both overlapping and covering routes</font>

571
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:14,190
from the same pier and they have the

572
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,040
same way as path that means that they're

573
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:19,440
functionally the same and so like in

574
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,800
this example over here the routes coming

577
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,500
three so if you remove one the longest

578
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:36,509
one there's functionally no change for

579

<font color="#E5E5E5">65,000 three the draft does say that if</font>

identifying in marking your black routes

587
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:02,609
you can by looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them or by having</font>

588
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,200
the router<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lesson you know which</font>

00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:07,410
ones are overlapping and fully

590
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,910
overlapping for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> is path top and</font>

00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,270
marking them with this bounded community

again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just community you use</font>

596
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:26,130
that more specific we don't want not

597
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:29,759
only that route but other more specific

598

routes that match it to escape<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras so we</font>

599
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,710
only mark the overland route with the

00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:38,580
bound of community and we make that be

601
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,770
preferred inside Ras bonus up how do you

602
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that you can do a little preference</font>

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:44,820
if you want to or our preferred

607
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:55,049
we say use the absolute value of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

608
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:58,170
community inside you Ras you can

609
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:01,980
optionally if you want to not install

610
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:03,390
that route<font color="#E5E5E5"> round table its marked you</font>

611
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,000
want to not install it you probably the

612
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:10,980
sale of course so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can filter it or</font>

613
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:12,750
compare it using the community and then

614
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,610
what we're saying in the draft is that

615
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should not you're going to go</font>

616
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">through all this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should not</font>

617
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,580
advertise this to your external peers

618
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,140
right at all purpose is that you're

619
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,869
already filtering you're replacing those

620
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,868
manual filters with this mechanism you

621
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:31,619
probably should not advertise this for

622
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:35,790
12 years and the graph goes further to

623
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:39,840
say that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you may want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

624
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:44,850
no export the wrong Oh what would happen

625
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,880
is this same drawing out before same

626
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:50,910
routes that what happens is what 65,000

627
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 router a gets the two routes that come</font>

628
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,549
from down there then router a would

629
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:59,250
notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are overlapping routes</font>

630
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:01,650
so it will remark the longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one with</font>

631
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:03,390
the bounded community as it gets routed

through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s for example through</font>

633
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,629
outer be they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would get the other the</font>

634
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:10,799
same longer prefix the the one with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

635
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,240
bounded community because we're using

<font color="#E5E5E5">either local preference with Kazmir</font>

00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,109
course rather see of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we'll get</font>

639
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:20,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well if you're implementing that</font>

640
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:24,180
should not advertise external e than

641
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:26,310
65,000 for would only get the shorter

642
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,819
prefix again for what we talked about

643
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:33,440
before this doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the dynamics</font>

644
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,810
of the routing and this is my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

645
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah uncle my aunt Maura a lot of people</font>

646
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:45,750
office work what is sent from 65 000

647
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:48,810
free to 6500<font color="#CCCCCC"> to em from 6500 to 265 /</font>

648
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:50,790
free there's no arrow there is 6500 to

649
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,490
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disconnected for this prefix or</font>

650
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:57,240
what no yeah sorry you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

651
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,959
this error is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there what's on what's</font>

652
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,848
the policy on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire</font>

653
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,470
correct so we're assuming here in this

654
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:04,030
simple diagram that everyone's just

655
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:07,720
having everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> too or else so that</font>

656
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:11,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">means is that yes 60 / 64 is propagated</font>

657
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:13,750
from 0 to 2 to 3 up there so normal

658
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,020
propagation of course what will happen

659
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,250
is 65 thousand and three flex its best

660
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">method</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to our place another</font>

661
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,320
song your normal BTW propagation we're

662
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:29,530
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming any other policy in there</font>

663
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:33,520
at all gabriel cisco are excellent

664
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:35,560
proposal arm should consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now i'm</font>

665
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,880
most implementations do take into

666
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:41,859
account that if the least specific route

667
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,070
and the most specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> most specific</font>

668
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:48,190
route our encounter at sea and the next

669
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:52,839
stops being sane they can auto aggregate

670
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think you can extend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to say if the</font>

671
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:58,450
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific route comes from a</font>

673
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:02,770
instance of more specific route coming

674
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,868
from the same next<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop as well you can</font>

675
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,240
order aggregate it which will

676
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,619
effectively increase the scope right

677
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,589
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we didn't put anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

678
00:42:08,619 --> 00:42:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">education here because the mechanism</font>

679
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,250
right now is sort of a general mechanism

680
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,960
we don't know if 65,000 three actually

681
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,000
owns the block if they can aggregate it

682
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,010
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> us up but yes the same concept on</font>

683
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the outgoing yeah of what we're</font>

684
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,089
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the income side and to just</font>

685
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,619
finish to that you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably make</font>

686
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:28,660
a reference to add but saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

687
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:36,040
where add parts could be effective as

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:39,790
well sure thanks hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi hello</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nicholas</font>

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:48,040
know if I didn't misunderstood what you

691
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">explained it you basically mark the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> /c</font>

697
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,970
don't know and a different one you

698
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:19,930
this way upstream yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that /</font>

699
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,899
city for a complimentary one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

700
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:26,819
little that's so overlapping by this is

701
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:29,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 but how about if you want to do that</font>

702
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:33,730
normal way you do because you don't want

703
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:37,839
to export the / city one and the other

704
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:42,880
asn that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> install that route he</font>

705
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:47,109
needs routers so you I mean you normally

706
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,380
may do that for load balance proposes

707
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:53,020
you publish the beer blog one small from

708
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,359
here once more from here but if you

709
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:59,290
discard this you are you know you are

710
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,630
screwing my load balancing yes I will so

711
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,220
jealous<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent question because</font>

712
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,020
that's that's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that we</font>

714
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,490
this again I'm not saying filter

715
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,560
everything if you have customers that

716
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:13,450
are giving you more specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> route so</font>

717
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that hidden load balance and you are</font>

718
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,080
telling them because they're paying you

719
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,589
or because whatever sure your opacity

720
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,670
more specifics that's your policy what

721
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:23,200
we're saying here is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

722
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,240
policy where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're filtering the</font>

723
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,279
overlapping route you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use those</font>

724
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,660
records if you're if you don't have a

725
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,490
policy that filters you overlapping

726
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,259
routes well don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a policy to focus</font>

727
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,859
your playground we're not recommending

728
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,300
we're not nothing that you change your

729
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:40,540
policies we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying if you</font>

730
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,849
already have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that policy this is a</font>

731
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,560
mechanism you so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be clear you</font>

732
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:48,030
have to pre arranged if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

733
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,080
be sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not on purpose overlapping</font>

734
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,390
right right so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons we</font>

735
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,640
showed it in this example up here is

736
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,740
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably this guy appear is far</font>

737
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,650
enough from the origin but he doesn't

738
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:01,959
care anymore right so he may be fine

739
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:05,589
with filtering the more specifics<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

740
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:08,260
local policy Peter yeah so good love her

741
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:09,609
this is slightly off the talk but it

742
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,510
must have happened on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mailing list</font>

743
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:15,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I didn't read so why why there are</font>

744
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,530
two I can see two reasons why they're

745
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,930
more specific is coming out of the 65

746
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:21,130
000 a they don't know what they're doing

747
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:22,690
or be<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are trying to do traffic</font>

748
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:26,020
engineering is there any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

749
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,289
and that brick and my next question is

750
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,630
going to

751
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:30,069
be how what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the split</font>

752
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,769
between don't know what they're doing

753
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:34,150
worse is they do traffic engineering the

754
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:36,160
first question the answer to both

755
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,289
questions is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

756
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,640
if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other reasons and I don't</font>

757
00:45:38,289 --> 00:45:41,890
know what the split is but video<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I</font>

758
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,660
figure those are the true reason we see

759
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,910
or I mean everyone sees that reporter

760
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,229
comes from jeff i think in others of

761
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:50,410
everyone that though that doesn't

762
00:45:47,229 --> 00:45:51,689
aggregate right and that's or the one

763
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,279
that will you leave all the routes

764
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:56,288
although more specifics and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

765
00:45:54,279 --> 00:46:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who just advertise all the</font>

766
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:00,999
specifics just because they can which

767
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:03,160
probably means they don't know what

768
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:07,390
they're doing I don't know how at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

769
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:10,689
slightest and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think Jeff is next but 2</font>

770
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:13,509
comments Geoff Huston and the first one

771
00:46:10,689 --> 00:46:15,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">wyd if I do this when I actually asked</font>

772
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:17,829
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> poker at the top of the cider</font>

773
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:19,359
but why do you do this their answer at

774
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:23,019
the time was so no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

775
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">hijackers with the / 24 and I kind of</font>

776
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:27,160
can't argue with that I make it seems a

777
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:28,599
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy but it's true you know the</font>

778
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">best they can do the attacker can do</font>

779
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,579
another / 24 let's play routing games

780
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:35,919
rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than more specifically so bear in</font>

781
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:38,409
mind there's a third thing what kind of

782
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:40,390
an kinda just kind of gets me on this is

783
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:42,069
you have a diagram where all this works

784
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,949
then I sort of think I yes I can do a

785
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:46,749
diagram when it doesn't work and part of

786
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:49,479
the reason I suppose why I'm sort of

787
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:52,538
getting up here is we've talked about

788
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:54,308
this kind of filtering of either more

789
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:58,569
specifics in various ways proxy

790
00:46:54,309 --> 00:47:01,390
filtering lots of times and as far as I

791
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:05,189
can see the real issue is what I want to

792
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:07,629
do in routing is Trump your policy

793
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:10,538
that's what I want to do when I announce

794
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:13,779
this stuff so no matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do I'm</font>

795
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:16,029
going to counter it because I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

796
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">win and then you try and defend so I'm</font>

797
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:21,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets us anywhere</font>

798
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:22,719
other than you escalate one step up and

799
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,569
I go hot you're escalating let me

800
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:29,529
escalate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> while well I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

801
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:31,329
fine and in an abstract sense you could

802
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:34,029
knock out around twenty twenty-five

803
00:47:31,329 --> 00:47:36,039
percent of the advertised routes 600,000

804
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:38,079
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400,000 yay let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the pub</font>

805
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:39,440
you know everyone wins in actual fact

806
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,690
you'll have 650

807
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,420
thousand routes because i'm going to

808
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:47,330
Blackmoor in and through various ways to

809
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">get around you because bgp is actually a</font>

810
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:51,740
negotiation policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an announcement</font>

811
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:54,470
policy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the protocol is all</font>

812
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:57,859
about who wins and you know who<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets to</font>

813
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,029
determine this so I'm trying to I can

814
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,540
see what you're trying to do and it's

815
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:04,910
great the pessimist in me says near not

816
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:11,930
going to work ok so to personally answer

817
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:13,279
one is reason well one is yes again if

818
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,720
you already have the policy we're not

819
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,890
telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go full term or if you</font>

820
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,220
already have a policy you can use this

821
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:21,740
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look back at ITF whatever</font>

822
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:24,259
number it was in product last time there

823
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,180
was a guy who came and presented he won

824
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:29,200
the applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> Deborah research price</font>

825
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,940
because it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called dragon</font>

826
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,430
dragon is this or this is dragon or

827
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,530
whatever it is right so but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise</font>

828
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:40,490
what I want to say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i don't have</font>

829
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mathematical proof he does that you</font>

830
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">know even if you and what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did is</font>

831
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommending what they</font>

832
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,520
did is they simulated this and a large

833
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,980
scale and for many of the policies that

834
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,830
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm likejust we even</font>

835
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:58,040
look at your diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slash 63</font>

836
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:01,009
somewhere go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and hit is 650 for</font>

837
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:04,700
now the reason why there's a / 64 going

838
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:07,190
that way is the originator 65,000 wants

839
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,200
the traffic to go you know CA Lee or

840
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,790
whatever it is right all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

841
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,460
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you remove the more specifics again</font>

842
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:16,460
there's policy going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what do i do in</font>

843
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,410
the result down the bottom I'd yeah work

844
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,510
a little bit harder in appetizing even

845
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:23,629
more junk to try and get over<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

846
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:26,840
policy let me see you never win yes so

847
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:29,420
let me say this again if you already are

848
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,400
doing this you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spec you</font>

849
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,690
listen I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling everyone to go</font>

850
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,780
run out and change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

851
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:38,300
configurations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not advocating the</font>

852
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to go filter local IP realms</font>

853
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,860
I'm saying if you're already<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

854
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:50,450
then you can use this mechanism that's

855
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:52,950
all very simple it's bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> WR folk well</font>

856
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:57,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I would</font>

857
00:49:52,950 --> 00:50:02,069
change we discussion topic slightly I

858
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:04,979
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been thinking about policy a long</font>

859
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:09,180
time and once in a while I did thought

860
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:12,810
experiments were a feature like this was

861
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:16,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">used I'm not going to dive into what</font>

862
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:18,740
policies can be used the question that

863
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:22,740
occurred when I did Hoover thought

864
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:25,319
experiments was well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what kind of</font>

865
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:29,549
feature is actually implementable in the

866
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:32,520
bgp implementations saying yes well okay

867
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:40,380
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced the generation of this</font>

868
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:47,060
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NOT</font>

869
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:51,780
into the bgp code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess that</font>

870
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:56,099
generating and with drawing attributes

871
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:58,650
on a route depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> existence on</font>

872
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:00,660
the existence of another route is

873
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:05,609
actually something that is not

874
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:08,910
straightforward and so I really would

875
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:11,369
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask some of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who know</font>

876
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:14,578
how the code can work that are in the

877
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:16,920
room whether doing something like

878
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:20,760
bounded and getting it withdrawn right

879
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:37,470
and so on actually is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

880
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:42,210
feasible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only play a bgp</font>

881
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:43,740
implementer on TV anymore um so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

882
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll try to answer that which is</font>

883
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:49,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you know everything can be done in</font>

884
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:53,040
software right<font color="#CCCCCC"> um sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John Scudder um</font>

885
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:56,009
it's it's not completely trivial i'm

886
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,720
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that RFC 4271 still says</font>

887
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:02,160
you're not allowed to but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

888
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:04,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can ignore things but yeah I</font>

889
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know point point taken that</font>

890
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,690
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a completely straightforward</font>

891
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:09,029
feature to implement

892
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,460
um the thing I actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to the</font>

893
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:16,220
mic to say Jeff mostly already said I

894
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:19,710
want to agree with his comments i will

895
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:22,259
add on I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think he ever quite fully</font>

896
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:24,690
expanded out the the example which is

897
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:28,410
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the rest of the game here</font>

898
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:31,319
right is when s6500 one starts you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

899
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:34,770
playing his filtering game is a a 65,000

900
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:37,440
you know takes that / 61 and explodes it

901
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:40,500
into whatever the you know hopefully

902
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,310
minimal but maybe not it could be all

903
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 64's and starts advertising them</font>

904
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:47,880
same answer because it seemed cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

905
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,680
definite same answer and we're not

906
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">advocating for anyone to pilot we're</font>

907
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,730
assuming that 6500<font color="#CCCCCC"> three is the one that</font>

908
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that policy right now and then that</font>

909
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">was my last comment was to reply to your</font>

910
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:02,000
answer which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know spoken like a</font>

911
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:05,280
true arms merchant takes one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know one</font>

912
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,130
but but on the other hand since we're

913
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,480
here in the grow working group if you

914
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:13,680
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

915
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">not advocating for it um how are we</font>

916
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,029
making the internet a better place by by

917
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:20,220
publishing this RFC or this draft so I

918
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,869
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't think that some</font>

919
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:27,240
people's policy are not a good idea it

920
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:29,910
works for that so sorry Robert yes John

921
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:32,578
you have any hints on the phone cut off

922
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,859
the mic yeah I did want to follow up to

923
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:39,390
that and if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if we have time so</font>

924
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:41,700
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up is of course if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um if</font>

925
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,859
all you were doing was enabling a policy

926
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,029
and it wouldn't make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference why</font>

927
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:46,200
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you publishing a document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

928
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,520
doesn't make any difference the answer

929
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,109
is of course it does make a difference

930
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,960
when you introduce a convenience feature

931
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:53,339
um and even though you you know are

932
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,960
saying a disclaimer what you're actually

933
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:56,310
doing by introducing a convenience

934
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,710
feature is you're encouraging people to

935
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:03,599
turn it on and so my comment is you keep

936
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,180
referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> alvaro that if someone has</font>

937
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:08,069
that policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

938
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,230
the policy to filter more specifics

939
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:11,550
however the point of more specific

940
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,099
specifics as Peter mentioned this

941
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:16,619
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTE and now we have the white</font>

942
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:18,839
communities as part of that i collected

943
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,280
lot of feedback from operators and they

944
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:23,610
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have one value</font>

945
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:25,740
which would enforce te and hops away so

946
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,020
if that community is attached to 64 and

947
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:33,629
you just delete it you're making those

948
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:35,670
lives miserable right so again that guy

949
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,280
over there<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 may already have that</font>

950
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,190
policy because he doesn't care doing

951
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,600
what 6500 is the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know maybe</font>

952
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:47,250
he's not getting paid or whatever it is

953
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:49,170
if the white community somehow says must

954
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:51,570
never delete the route or something

955
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and still in hops away then this</font>

956
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy should be applied because</font>

957
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,910
obviously that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right the</font>

958
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">meaning of do I communities actually</font>

959
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:02,220
make it preferred and hops away right so

960
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:04,649
and and and your and your decision is lo

961
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,330
que esta and next up will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

962
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:08,520
and then you're treating them as bounded

963
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:10,920
yeah and just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more thing you people</font>

964
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,560
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> focused today they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this</font>

965
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:19,800
today they do this today just with

966
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:21,120
another tool right I mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we</font>

967
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,460
can't sit here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say they were gonna</font>

968
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,290
take yikes controls and roadmaps away

969
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,270
from people because they might do the

970
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:28,880
wrong thing they do the wrong thing

971
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:36,540
already many people do the right thing

972
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:38,760
but you know Chris tomorrow so I this

973
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,759
strikes me is a lot like VA when I read

974
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:43,050
it originally and it kind of still in

975
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,960
the same concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> so sort of let me</font>

976
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:48,240
reduce my routing my individual routing

977
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,940
domain review but still maintain reach

978
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,189
ability right which you're doing you're

979
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,750
saying there's overlapping routes I want

980
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,490
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the small stuff I want to</font>

981
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,650
save some<font color="#CCCCCC"> space time memory speed what</font>

982
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,680
have you I still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

983
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,170
reach those places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems fine right</font>

984
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,149
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think all the conversation about you</font>

985
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,710
know she did this or not people like you

986
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,450
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> people already do it if you're</font>

987
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to document a process or</font>

988
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,169
procedure or configuration I think

989
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:15,150
that's interesting I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

990
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:17,040
would do it but you know that's that's

991
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,170
cool right everyone does<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own thing</font>

992
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,200
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it falls into like a</font>

993
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:23,550
consenting adult problem like right you

994
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,020
know you decide to lose route to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

995
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,180
network so that you can save<font color="#E5E5E5"> money time</font>

996
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,310
speed whatever cool but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font>

997
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,450
the day you still have to reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it</font>

998
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:32,279
the rest of the internet so there's some

999
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:33,879
complexity that you're implicitly or

1000
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,310
explicitly adding

1001
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,250
that may they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not save you money</font>

1002
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:42,400
like you think it does I would you I

1003
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:43,630
think I think your paper document sort

1004
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,970
of says that but at the end of the day

1005
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:47,410
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your documented configuration or set</font>

1006
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,410
of configurations that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems</font>

1007
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:53,170
fine right so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think people</font>

1008
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:57,790
already do this this may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just easier</font>

1009
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:59,860
to hear then chain ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend Cisco I</font>

1010
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,290
just wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a follow-up comment</font>

1011
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:05,500
that I actually think it will end up

1012
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:08,290
reducing the Internet table size for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1013
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,750
reason that more specifics can be

1014
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,430
aggregated it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to spoof and</font>

1015
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,720
inject the less specifics into the

1016
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:15,399
network because there are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1017
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,529
origin validation that you can enforce

1018
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and if you can</font>

1019
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:23,350
effectively start filtering more

1020
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:25,630
specifics at your in your example 65,000

1021
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:28,930
or three then you have a good solution

1022
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:31,600
now obviously if 65,000 03 has some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

1023
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,609
of business arrangement with 65,000 012

1024
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:41,230
League then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fail with</font>

1025
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:46,410
that we're three so chermont<font color="#E5E5E5"> a um right</font>

1026
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:48,700
John hey understand what you're I

1027
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:53,759
understand what you're proposing up here

1028
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:58,600
I the benefit it could provide however

1029
00:57:53,760 --> 00:58:03,130
like Jeff I have my doubts about its

1030
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:05,770
efficacy in the sense that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1031
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these lines on the graph there may</font>

1032
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">be assumptions made about the the</font>

1033
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:17,470
interconnectedness of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> guesses that</font>

1034
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not necessarily true or at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least not</font>

1035
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:22,930
necessarily true<font color="#E5E5E5"> in certain regions of</font>

1036
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,570
the world meaning there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1037
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:28,509
internet exchange points out there there

1038
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:31,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a lot of providers and not all but a</font>

1039
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,730
lot of providers that have a very set of

1040
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:36,010
rich interconnection help excuse me

1041
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,830
policies and if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your diagram</font>

1042
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:41,560
up there this<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically will fall apart</font>

1043
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:45,839
if 65,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> to has a direct neighbor ship</font>

1044
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:48,390
with 65,000 for right so no

1045
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:50,430
no the answer's no for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65 thousand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1046
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:53,069
three at one fall apart because it it is

1047
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:55,019
implementing its policy well fact that

1048
00:58:53,069 --> 00:58:56,549
the effect is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doesn't get all</font>

1049
00:58:55,019 --> 00:58:58,258
the specifics that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intent</font>

1050
00:58:56,549 --> 00:59:01,769
right the intended for three to filter

1051
00:58:58,259 --> 00:59:04,710
its own stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens behind it no</font>

1052
00:59:01,769 --> 00:59:05,999
but what I'm saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're I'm</font>

1053
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:09,420
understanding correctly you're

1054
00:59:05,999 --> 00:59:12,058
attempting to only<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced the less</font>

1055
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:14,759
specific right from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand three to</font>

1056
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:18,690
65,000 for the save table space in

1057
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:22,259
65,000 for know the intent is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6500</font>

1058
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:25,349
and 32 may be safe save the table space

1059
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:27,739
in its yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's okay well then same</font>

1060
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:31,380
comment still applies though because

1061
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:34,769
he's going to need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to see or</font>

1062
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:36,539
65,000 for or other a<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas as they form</font>

1063
00:59:34,769 --> 00:59:38,910
these adjacencies are going to need to

1064
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that more specific as the</font>

1065
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:46,170
interconnection mesh<font color="#E5E5E5"> increases in</font>

1066
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:48,839
density so I just again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I doubt the</font>

1067
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,640
efficacy of this proposal in courtroom

1068
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:57,869
is it quick Ruettiger because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1069
00:59:50,640 --> 01:00:01,440
yet yes yes again I know we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

1070
00:59:57,869 --> 01:00:04,140
eye dr IDR should shoot and needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1071
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:08,519
decide whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Baja the feature can</font>

1072
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:12,239
be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the any feature that is</font>

1073
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:15,629
introduced can help<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to create bad</font>

1074
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:19,559
policies I know I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the feature</font>

1075
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:22,739
for things I cannot do without it that

1076
01:00:19,559 --> 01:00:26,369
that are beneficial for my network and

1077
01:00:22,739 --> 01:00:28,469
do not have any external consequences

1078
01:00:26,369 --> 01:00:32,460
except<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm serving my customers</font>

1079
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:34,259
better solution we're not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDRs</font>

1080
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:38,039
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduces no changes to</font>

1081
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:39,690
the protocol so I think base of our

1082
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:42,289
discussion we need more discussion on

1083
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:46,849
the list on this draft so

1084
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:50,029
I think your next steps you want to call

1085
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:51,529
for adoption I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more</font>

1086
01:00:50,029 --> 01:00:56,089
discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list based off the</font>

1087
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:57,829
feedback today thank you so that's

1088
01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:01,308
that's it our microphone doesn't work

1089
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:03,529
but that's it for this meeting will see

1090
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:13,689
you all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin and on the mailing</font>

1091
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:21,880
list thank you what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly back</font>

1092
01:01:13,689 --> 01:01:21,879
saturday yeah
