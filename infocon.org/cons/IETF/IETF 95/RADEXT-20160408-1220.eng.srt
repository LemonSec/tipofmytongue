74
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,280
time on this because there is a slide

83
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,330
hoping to finish it in the flight when I

84
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:46,810
get back one question i had when i read

85
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document is this was a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

86
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,039
legwork and there is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> table with</font>

87
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,220
approximately 200 or something

00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,630
are getting now a data type where they

90
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,190
didn't have one before and one question

91
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would probably have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> treat in the</font>

92
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,400
white<font color="#CCCCCC"> hapus did all these attributes did</font>

93
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,169
all this work get enough eyeballs on it

94
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,510
i mean it's alan's work and actually

95
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,030
drank terms of coffee while writing it

96
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,889
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing really far a job but</font>

97
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,159
errors might have happened and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wonder</font>

98
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,650
if all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these attributes actually got a</font>

99
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,880
second pair of eyes checking through it

100
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:27,460
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sad if not but well we'll have</font>

101
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see about that the action on that one</font>

102
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">is of course for me to complete the</font>

103
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:34,990
right up and then at some point we can

104
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,520
advance this to ITF last call we also

105
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,430
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents which are currently</font>

112
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:59,680
deck on that to discuss the remaining

113
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,659
open issues there and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have my</font>

114
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,279
draft on<font color="#E5E5E5"> considerate considerations</font>

115
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:05,590
regarding the correct use of response

116
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,999
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> which triggered a fair amount</font>

117
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,619
of discussion of the mailing list which

118
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:12,580
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect at this stage but never</font>

119
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:18,629
mind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was fun so this was the</font>

120
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">initial draft submitted on 2016 March 21</font>

121
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,150
actually meanwhile thanks to all this

122
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">lively</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion I have lots of</font>

123
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,419
homework to complete for another one

124
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,460
written and they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a slide deck</font>

125
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:32,310
which tries to summarize all those

126
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:32,310
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we've been talking about</font>

127
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,300
lastly we have one piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new work</font>

128
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,610
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not currently on our stack but</font>

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,020
might become<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which is the radius</font>

di<font color="#E5E5E5"> erent and colleagues actually we have</font>

submitted january nineteen twenty

135
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,270
sixteen and the authors have a slight

00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">deck on it I hope somebody is going to</font>

137
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:09,520
present doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like it well</font>

138
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:12,129
anyway what we also have roughly on our

139
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,188
radar is some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who submitted</font>

140
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:17,349
drafts with the radix twerking group

141
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">named in them some of which we talked</font>

142
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,188
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier but we haven't heard from</font>

143
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:24,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">them in a while so there's draft Clemmie</font>

144
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:27,669
reset radix very common vs a's and draft

145
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:29,199
erevan try text message bundling these

146
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,508
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussion there</font>

147
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,180
was no real consensus to take them into

148
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the working groups so I'm prepared to</font>

149
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,779
just drop them off the radar unless

150
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,750
somebody really thinks this needs

151
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,789
discussion still<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also noticed that the</font>

152
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">data tracker has one other new draft</font>

153
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,140
which I haven't heard anything about but

154
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:50,290
it sits there which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called draft one</font>

155
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,209
or a text multicast radius extensions so

156
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,339
it's an active ID somebody published

157
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:58,779
that with the intent of coming to radix

158
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:00,459
but I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard anything so yeah if</font>

159
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:05,279
somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about it would be</font>

160
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:05,279
nice to raise discussion points on the

161
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,569
yeah and that's pretty much all i see on

162
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:17,019
our radar at this point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

163
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:20,229
immediately like to continue with the

164
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:23,279
slight<font color="#E5E5E5"> x we had so the first one would</font>

165
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:26,110
be the IP port radius extensions arm

166
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:52,290
question is is there somebody here and

167
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:55,990
able to present on them yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

168
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,118
here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go yes sir so yeah this isn't a</font>

169
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,649
bit of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Trotters ask me yeah</font>

170
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:04,839
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just as a reminder</font>

171
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,579
this this dress has passed working with

172
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,860
classical since last year so with the

173
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,099
foreign key for the review that has been

174
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,540
come there recently so web we integrate

175
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,199
the comment that we ship from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the union</font>

176
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:20,709
but again it may thanks for a detailed

177
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:22,508
review yes Jerry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I very appreciated so</font>

178
00:10:20,709 --> 00:10:24,609
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't agreed all the Knesset hub</font>

179
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:26,799
that has been raised during that review

180
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,549
and also some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a trail coming that has</font>

181
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:32,799
been raised also from from Alan but

182
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:35,049
still we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one issue there that is</font>

183
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,499
displayed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next slide it's about</font>

184
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">the inner section in fact we have the</font>

185
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:42,279
current approach in the draft we all the

186
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:44,920
attributes all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tvs have the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

187
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:49,179
same name and the same the same the same

188
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,459
ID but unit has a point is that he

189
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:54,490
thinks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is more straightforward</font>

190
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:55,959
to to to define dedicated to just wait

191
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,179
for the nested attribute so that you

192
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,819
that this attributes even if they have

193
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:04,269
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same name DM we have identified will</font>

194
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:06,519
depend on on the parent attributes so as

195
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:09,129
author of this graph don't have in the

196
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,379
am you know we will fill out the

197
00:11:09,129 --> 00:11:13,239
recommendation from the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> up but</font>

198
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,889
despite there is no recommendation in

199
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:19,179
existing that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RX is to how to</font>

200
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,129
proceed with this issue so it's we were

201
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,978
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> adore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

202
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:26,410
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the draft or to go</font>

203
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:28,359
with the proposal from from your unit so

204
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,799
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more working on this so that</font>

205
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:46,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this soon and ship the draft</font>

206
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:52,679
hopefully in after this this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font>

207
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:58,269
yeah it's a little yes the point is that

208
00:11:52,679 --> 00:12:00,189
as it was defined and how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> registry</font>

209
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maintained are meant to be maintained</font>

210
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:05,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it just about codes it's not</font>

211
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">about name so at least I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just repeating</font>

212
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:14,349
my my comment but I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it</font>

213
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:16,779
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easier because the main points</font>

214
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:20,220
was the extensibility and to be able to

215
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:23,769
create any number of new attributes

216
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,389
using a speaks name whereas you are

217
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,669
using the same sub attribute in

218
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:31,779
different parent attribute will restrict

219
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:35,350
the number of possible values so it's

220
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:39,279
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was proposing to just follow the</font>

221
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:41,559
recommendation of the of the of the RFC

222
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,459
defining the use of the extended AVP

223
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:48,399
attributes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and to just have a</font>

224
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:51,878
unique identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will comply with</font>

225
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,679
so that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be relevant only for</font>

226
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:56,109
apparent attributes so it would mean

227
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,470
that the name need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because we need to</font>

228
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:05,619
have a unique name we you will have one

229
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:07,659
name pair parents actually so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

230
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:10,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposal I think it's otherwise if you</font>

231
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:12,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">are using the same names whatever the</font>

232
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:14,699
number of parental abuse that will use

233
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:18,459
these attributes you will you will

234
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:21,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">reserve unnecessary a number of venues</font>

235
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,400
that would could be allocated parent

236
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:29,380
attributes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it why I would propose</font>

237
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:31,120
after that it's a discussion so may I

238
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:35,350
don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alan is saying something</font>

239
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,290
but my recommendation would be in this

240
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,620
direction now except if someone has a

241
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,750
strong opinion against I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

242
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be better and it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a clear also</font>

243
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,070
because it is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that we</font>

244
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,610
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use cyber tribute to multiple</font>

245
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:53,560
parents attributes but it may come with

246
00:13:51,610 --> 00:14:01,390
the next draft we need to have a clear

247
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:11,410
guidelines yes so jess is not in the

248
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:12,910
queue no Alan I'm sorry I woke you just

249
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,620
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead no wine I was just surprised</font>

250
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:26,890
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with you yeah i GQ button here</font>

251
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:28,690
anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> um wait there's no games but we</font>

252
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,980
have to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time</font>

253
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:35,650
we're using multiple tvs in multiple

254
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,570
places I don't really have a good

255
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,520
solution here and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

256
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense that doesn't shoot ourselves</font>

257
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,090
in the foot

258
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:56,110
well I wonder and how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

259
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,540
shooting ourselves in the foot with any

260
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,610
other two suggestions it's just

261
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,829
allocating a different set of integers

262
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,780
for the same things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see any</font>

263
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,150
interrupt problems no matter which

264
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,490
approach we choose it's mostly beauty

265
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:11,290
contest so anyway I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have many</font>

266
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,270
steaks in yourself and let's all say or

267
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,579
take and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current approach in</font>

268
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,770
the draft is more simple from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell</font>

269
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone there's no dedicated to register</font>

270
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,240
for each of the air tubes as we already

271
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined in the draft so I think it's</font>

272
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,690
more it's more simple but I understand

273
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the one the proposed that has been</font>

274
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:30,730
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> by value net but please give us one</font>

275
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,849
day I feel so so that we can speed up so

276
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,290
I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have it's one year</font>

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,130
that we are we are waiting so for a go

278
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:43,180
for its draft I think that's the ice if

279
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:45,550
it's mike want was just actually looking

280
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the iono and the algae registries</font>

281
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain so the recurrence for the</font>

282
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,550
ionized simple when you have one single

283
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,060
name exactly but the consequences on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

284
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,920
registry is more complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> because when</font>

285
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,920
you are declaring the in the registry

286
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:03,370
when you are decrying this attribute and

287
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,010
the sub attributes you need to define to

288
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:11,170
allocate an idea in the registry itself

289
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:13,870
yes video but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that</font>

290
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">this value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be unique whatever the</font>

291
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">apparent attribute you will need to</font>

292
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">declare for all the existing or next</font>

293
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:25,450
parent attributes that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> value can</font>

294
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,400
only be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> this name will be used</font>

295
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,790
whatever the parent attributes and there

296
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,660
is no way to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> closets in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registry</font>

297
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,819
yes this is part of the specification

298
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:38,199
itself in which you specify this kind of

299
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,880
behavior but but anyway yeah yeah so so

300
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,089
we are wondering here about whether or

301
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,380
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the complexity so maybe</font>

302
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,800
one way forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be to actually</font>

303
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,420
actually ask I Anna um do you mind if we

304
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,709
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you handle that complexity</font>

305
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,540
hey I do think is a recommendation from

306
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,010
this working to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is</font>

307
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,959
this is the first time you I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

308
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,710
you have this kind of issues to to

309
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,380
process it would be good if you

310
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,120
what you know just for the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab</font>

311
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can you will have the main issue</font>

312
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,199
so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guideline so to say</font>

313
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,020
that so we don't have this kind of

314
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,990
discussion again in the future so the

315
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:16,879
proposed unless if you you know as an

316
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,170
objection is agree that we go for the

317
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,360
current option that we have on the draft

318
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:22,520
and during the discussion with Diana we

319
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,929
can you know once the draft aspect we

320
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,930
passed the East your review look at we

321
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:31,670
can we can we ask ask again this this

322
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:36,490
question if this with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corey oh ok that's</font>

323
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,490
that as we BN and he be cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

324
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so this means for the Shepherd</font>

325
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,690
right up probably that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should put an</font>

326
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,450
extra note I and I should carefully look

327
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,820
at this particular aspect and tell us if

328
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:52,580
they can handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or they want this</font>

329
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:54,169
changed but but it is something anyways

330
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,399
that will need to clarify because it

331
00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,230
cannot be left for finance it will be in

332
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,540
the report of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting but we should</font>

333
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something here because how it is</font>

334
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,830
defined in the RFC it is said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is</font>

335
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,750
only relevant pair parent attributes so

336
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,760
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make clear that if it is not</font>

337
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:13,250
the case at least to put an errata or

338
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,040
something as it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by anyone</font>

339
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,320
after that because we don't have to

340
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:22,940
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> each time how to do that for</font>

341
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,960
for the next for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next draft yeah I</font>

342
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's clear that whatever we come</font>

343
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,770
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is the way to go for all</font>

344
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,770
future draft yeah

345
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay advanced okay if not then the next</font>

346
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,910
discussion would be about cui proxy for

347
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,460
which we have allocated 10 minutes and

348
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:06,320
since elements with us I guess we can

349
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:12,390
just start right away all right over to

350
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:21,710
put the slides up not a whole lot new to

351
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:25,500
add here for the next slide so is the

352
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:30,720
the real organization here is the

353
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,700
ability to spoof the replies coming back

354
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,430
so when you send the package from a

355
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,590
visited network oh my god that's great

356
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,180
straightforward that works<font color="#CCCCCC"> andreas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

357
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,730
hardest because there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

358
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:45,270
occasion credentials in that packet you

359
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,120
can't spoof of how users password the

360
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:52,170
packets coming back the other way the

361
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:58,409
authentication data like<font color="#CCCCCC"> stated is</font>

362
00:19:52,170 --> 00:20:00,710
visible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of the proxies that means</font>

363
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,810
that the whole proxies can spoof it

364
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:09,360
minimize it by not prevent it in

365
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:13,710
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that 3576 and 51</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> others it's</font>

366
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,530
written assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russell as possible</font>

367
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,170
but not really talking about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

368
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,530
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mass treated all the attributes</font>

369
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is intended on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is as you</font>

370
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:29,280
start adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> / leaves which are specific</font>

371
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,949
to proxying you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

372
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,710
the local radius server<font color="#E5E5E5"> romanum is all</font>

373
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,800
those attributes earth where it sends

374
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,790
them fact this is only what's happened

375
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:43,850
to the real whatever

376
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:47,629
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this if the mass received</font>

377
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:50,120
proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> state then it generates an error</font>

378
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,340
saying unsupported attribute even<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">fit a 1 706 says you are required to</font>

380
00:20:52,340 --> 00:21:00,169
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proxy silent and bad knees we</font>

381
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:03,050
added with a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a text of pain and</font>

382
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Andy actually tickets ahead Emma knowing</font>

383

room at the workman's back to operate

385
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,710
other than Peter T keep us in comments I

386
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:17,780
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> try you like further clarification</font>

387
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:29,390
on and i think that's it bring these

388
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:32,410
things back side yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just just</font>

389
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,410
talks about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was saying earlier</font>

390
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:41,300
that's what I we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much to say</font>

391
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:49,370
i have not said a year for most likely

392
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:51,560
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah because this is all the</font>

393
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:54,530
best additional information so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

394
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:57,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in slice pick the number</font>

395
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,370
of land you cry

396
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,300
so one question for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> site is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

397
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:21,640
suggested<font color="#E5E5E5"> two alternatives for the text</font>

398
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:24,520
here I can get back here on the second

399
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:28,120
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> says all server attributes and you</font>

400
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,129
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in quotes here I think that from</font>

401
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,989
the wording this should need some

402
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,940
clarification because what is itself

403
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,720
right route it's kind of undefined

404
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:39,400
technology at this point are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm not</font>

405
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,200
totally happy with that formulation but

406
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,540
the first one actually are it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

407
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:51,300
me yeah those are the first one under

408
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds less attributes been</font>

409
00:22:51,300 --> 00:23:00,010
signaling<font color="#E5E5E5"> attributes as planned perhaps</font>

410
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:05,020
basically a pasar a different statement

411
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:06,879
of the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> but in most vs rogers</font>

412
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:13,110
economy we can rephrase the first one to

413
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:15,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> co a proxy must add after betraying</font>

delay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the okanagan are very difficult</font>

426
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,920
so yeah so what we have in the first one

427
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,320
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-defined whiteness because</font>

428
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually observe what the client</font>

429
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,399
was in before for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the natural</font>

430
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,649
setting before and the second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

431
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,070
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite so well defined blacklists</font>

432
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:22,980
covering all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

433
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:36,970
enumeration those is probably hard oh

434
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:42,970
yeah but anyway that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> rimshot coming to</font>

435
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:47,020
the night Mac<font color="#CCCCCC"> gym shot so in reading</font>

436
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:52,690
these two things I know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

437
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:57,220
one says the second one bothers me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

438
00:24:52,690 --> 00:25:01,380
lot of respects including trying to

439
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:03,490
decide how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I'm a final proxy and</font>

440
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:12,820
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what I'm supposed</font>

441
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:17,740
to remove and that just it just doesn't

442
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:22,120
feel me with warm glowing feeling sure

443
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:26,260
so all i'll update the document to use

444
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,120
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> persian and try and add a bit</font>

445
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,500
of excellent sort of explanatory text

446
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,709
around it um to explain why it's

447
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,710
necessary

448
00:25:43,010 --> 00:26:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm so any other discussion points</font>

449
00:25:47,280 --> 00:26:03,899
on the draft wonderful then the next

450
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,450
topic would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the populating of</font>

451
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,830
identity and allocated five minutes for

452
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,420
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since i'm the chair i can</font>

453
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:12,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">immediately adjust this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess it takes</font>

454
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:20,760
a few seconds more than that due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

455
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:33,620
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion we had so could you</font>

456
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:36,000
advance the slide so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

457
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,739
populating<font color="#E5E5E5"> of identity and it is the</font>

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,340
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that clogged up the mailing list</font>

459
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,380
in the last couple of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this was</font>

460
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,220
finally accepted as a working group item

461
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:49,980
and the changes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime were</font>

462
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,150
that this is now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp drag</font>

463
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,790
arm there is a terminology section in

464
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:59,760
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make up some identifiers but my</font>

465
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,530
choice maybe was not the best so we

466
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually discussed this on the manliest</font>

467
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:07,139
quite a bit the important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about</font>

468
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,480
this is that we very much converge that

469
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,730
we only care about the one identifier

470
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,010
that is transported it sides eep

471
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,450
response identity and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

472
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">about anything that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening inside</font>

473
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,560
the method and that should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

474
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,470
guidance for all following discussions

475
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:24,210
are because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in no way trying to</font>

476
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:27,540
interfere with eat methods as they are

477
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:29,220
deployed well the basic advice of the

478
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,700
document is still unchanged from the

479
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">times of my individual draft so you can</font>

480
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,510
do on the supplicant whatever you like

481
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use and holdings wherever you</font>

482
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:41,370
find them the thing is as soon as you

483
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,220
actually choose to put a string on the

484
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:46,830
wire inside the response identity make

485
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,350
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is utf-8 at that point for the</font>

486
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,090
supplicant this means yes maintain stage

487
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,860
if he start all these strings in its

488
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,649
local config and the local conflict was

489
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,080
using ebc dick or something else that's

490
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:02,340
all fine but as it goes out to the wire

491
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,949
it has to be utf-8 the second point

492
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,949
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably bit more worthy of</font>

493
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,929
discussion as we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned last days</font>

494
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:13,110
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pool of more than one</font>

495
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:16,049
method and more than one realm

496
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier as a consequence you can</font>

497
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:21,030
choose from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those it may be that one</font>

498
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,918
obsession<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not enough to get a sexual</font>

499
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication so the one who chose</font>

500
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe just lot of work and then there is</font>

501
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,500
a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe third fourth alternative</font>

502
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,149
and you should try<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out if the first</font>

503
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:36,450
one failed and this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

504
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,460
run an entirely new EAP conversation so

505
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not about deep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> training in any</font>

506
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">way so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

507
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,799
obsession alive these are several

508
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,030
distinct obsessions until one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

509
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:54,480
plentiful identifies you have actually

510
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:56,879
succeeds exactly so we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

511
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,460
discussion on the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> on much</font>

512
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of which actually led to pending changes</font>

513
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,090
in the draft I was creating these likes

514
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,610
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few days ago with many more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rent to be</font>

515
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,280
discussed points but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

516
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,049
terms of what goes into the draft most

517
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,530
of the text is now excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> converged</font>

518
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">at and solved so one point was that i</font>

519
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,510
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using these inner and outer identity</font>

520
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:25,469
notions which many eat methods actually

521
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:27,990
use but maybe it is better in indy to to

522
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,760
invent some new terminology to steer

523
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,460
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all kinds of misunderstandings</font>

524
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,890
in terms of which method meant what has

525
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,510
an identity so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we now</font>

526
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,330
have user identifiers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and realm</font>

527
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:41,070
identifiers and these are the things i

528
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:45,689
will use in the next revision of the

529
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:51,510
document then the other point was can we

530
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually tell our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> z</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3748 that everything</font>

531
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:56,190
has to be utf-8 at this point it's

532
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,190
arguably slightly beyond our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandate</font>

533
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:02,130
because we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> only supposed to clear</font>

534
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,590
about the AP vividus transported over a

535
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,200
triple

536
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:08,168
rennsport but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time it is and</font>

537
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,610
actually been at a boba said it would be

538
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,799
better if somebody actually made that

539
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,779
global statement inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay eep</font>

540
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:16,960
response identity is always under all

541
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:19,299
circumstances utf-8 or you doing

542
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">something wrong so we can have an</font>

543
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:23,590
updates relationship to 3748 and we can

544
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,539
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> write it in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that should</font>

545
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:30,820
be it local and coatings of identifiers

546
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:33,490
you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's true</font>

547
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:35,710
so there are no restrictions on what

548
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,029
happens in this applicants so talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

549
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vegas what happens in the supplicant</font>

550
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,470
stays in the supplicant but as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

551
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:51,010
you communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the outside world</font>

552
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:53,710
you use utf-8 and that's it then we had

553
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:55,539
an interesting discussion about what is

554
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,580
the relationship between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realm</font>

555
00:30:55,539 --> 00:31:03,490
identifying the user identifier and one

556
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,168
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there are situations where you</font>

557
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,120
can't do with one real man in the file

558
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,580
could have multiple methods and they

559
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,770
have multiple different identifiers in

560
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,439
the methods and there has to be some

561
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:15,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of link between what is inside the</font>

562
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,919
method at what is sent as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font>

563
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,570
identity it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean they have to</font>

564
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,860
be identical they can be totally

565
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,710
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> strings that can be totally</font>

566
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">different encodings but there is a</font>

567
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,659
dependency in the way that if you have

568
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:30,909
children eat method and you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

569
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:33,370
choose one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realm identifiers</font>

570
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:35,710
which makes sure that your request

571
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,870
actually terminates at a server which

572
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,480
can handle whatever comes inside that

573
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:43,418
eat method in the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">draft I always said well this means that</font>

575
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:47,919
the Rev identify is specific to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,140
method<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it an method specific</font>

577
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,049
identifiers and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised all kinds of</font>

578
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:56,559
concerns so<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that we just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

579
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:58,360
is a dependency of some sorts it might

580
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's say you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> methods</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and two of those actually can be catered</font>

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,610
for with the same same realm<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier</font>

583
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,860
lucky you so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not necessarily a</font>

00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,350
one-to-one relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> are could be</font>

00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,110
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> relative fires then there are</font>

586
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:23,169
methods on the system are but

587
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:26,350
you don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logic</font>

588
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:28,420
in terms of selecting the realm

589
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,969
identifiers first you select the method

590
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:32,500
with which you want to authenticate with

591
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:35,020
then you look up which of the realm

592
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,090
identifiers is suitable for using that

593
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,040
you responds identity there and then you

594
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:45,100
send bad realm<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in response</font>

595
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:47,830
identity in terms of the user identifier

596
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:51,189
that was probably the most controversial

597
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:54,220
pointed at this point so if somebody

598
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,830
were to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new eat method probably</font>

599
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,260
it would be a good idea if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

600
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:02,918
used nai identify us for its user

601
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,660
identifiers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is for some</font>

602
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,929
reason not possible and also especially

603
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,669
for existing methods we're not

604
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:12,610
suggesting any changes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed</font>

605
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:14,679
reality out there so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only advice</font>

606
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,110
for the future if you happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to design a</font>

607
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,860
new eat method it would be better if you

608
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:25,270
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a magnet nai and finally the last</font>

609
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,668
issue are the realm identifiers what

610
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:30,809
about the local parts and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

611
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:34,390
structure we want to it goes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

612
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:37,389
one point which came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is that</font>

613
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,360
aah what the nai document suggests is

614
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,980
that the local part should be empty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

615
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,320
there is this backward compatibility for

616
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,870
I'm universe that this is just this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

617
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,790
spring which is suggested if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

618
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,939
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you cannot do with the</font>

619
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:54,909
low with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the empty logo part and then</font>

620
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:58,720
the second thing is that we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

621
00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:01,000
to see any eyes are on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in</font>

622
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,510
the response identity are so you can

623
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,370
have good routing rules it's maybe too

624
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,260
much to ask it for everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

625
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,638
planet even inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprises because</font>

626
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,929
inside an enterprise you don't have to

627
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,340
hear about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

628
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,710
does but the suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must be</font>

629
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,050
in LA I if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to interact with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

630
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:22,270
outside world in any way and it should

631
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:24,609
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anime</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i if you are in a closed world</font>

632
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,989
just in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might at one point to</font>

633
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:27,989
decide you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave your closed</font>

634
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:29,279
world but if

635
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:31,949
you want to stick with some local

636
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:37,230
identify it which is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any I there</font>

637
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:38,460
is no way to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> here anyway yeah the</font>

638
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:40,619
last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we didn't touch on the</font>

639
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:45,570
mailing list yet I guess we have to at

640
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,629
some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i remembered honolulu and it</font>

641
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:51,360
was this point discussed in the meeting

642
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,290
that when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> utf8 were you may also</font>

643
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,490
want to talk about normalization

644
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:58,619
actually I don't but the idea there was

645
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:02,160
that we should follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ni document</font>

646
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:04,080
then say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay every peer things it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

647
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,509
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to normalize the string before</font>

648
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,319
putting in each response identity then

649
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,910
it can do that nobody else are should

650
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,610
try to fiddle with it while it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

651
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:17,279
flight on the way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server I think</font>

652
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:19,020
that's with a good same suggestion and I

653
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,530
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> put that in the document I've</font>

654
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,190
simply forgot about that so yeah

655
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,500
actually we

656
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:31,980
converged on most of these issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will</font>

657
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:36,990
write a new wrath um just maybe this one

658
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,940
word of of extra discussion here if you

659
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:42,299
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most recently exchanges with</font>

660
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,040
banana and Ellen the question was really

661
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,310
nothing about the wording of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

662
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,920
itself but about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use case is it in</font>

663
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,259
any way normal or can it be expected

664
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have more than one method to</font>

665
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:58,440
use for a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and that was</font>

666
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,839
pretty exotic out until recently because

667
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,079
if you configured your supplicant let's

668
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:05,609
say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wi-Fi enterprise network the</font>

669
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">configure in your sample can typically</font>

670
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:11,009
ask you so which method do you want to

671
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,430
use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this SSID and that's it so there</font>

672
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a one-to-one relationship between SD</font>

673
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:20,149
and the eat method unfortunately the

674
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,460
word is getting getting more complex and

675
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:25,380
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> true everybody actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are has</font>

676
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,660
realized that or actually cares enough

677
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,770
about this world so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

678
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:36,089
arguably 802 11 interworking chapter

679
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:39,000
which basically has as a as an

680
00:36:36,089 --> 00:36:40,859
underlying theme the SSID<font color="#CCCCCC"> listening a</font>

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,050
string<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's burnt and it's not good</font>

682
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:47,130
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to select the network we devise</font>

683
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:49,079
completely new ways of arm for network

684
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,050
to show which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of identifies it</font>

685
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:55,160
supports one of those is that the Wi-Fi

686
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,560
beacon can say hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

687
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:03,930
cellular sim card and it is from the

688
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,849
operator mcc<font color="#E5E5E5"> 123 and MNC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e45 then you</font>

689
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,710
can log<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this network never mind the</font>

690
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:09,720
SSID we don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the SSID and</font>

691
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,609
there are other things like roaming

692
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,950
consortium identifiers with the same

693
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:16,770
idea so if you've contributed the

694
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:19,078
clients to know that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

695
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,839
credential which is valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a roaming</font>

696
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:24,510
consortium and the Wi-Fi access point

697
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,099
the midst I support logins for people

698
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,619
with an account at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> roaming</font>

699
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:31,230
consortium then the SSID is just not

700
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,869
relevant anymore and the consequences of

701
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:36,089
that is you might have may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

702
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:39,510
configuration on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your device which says</font>

703
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:42,540
if i come to the SSID at your own i use

704
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,220
prudential if i come to networks which

705
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,290
support my sim card i will use my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim</font>

706
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:49,020
card and then the unpleasant part is

707
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,000
when the Wi-Fi network actually has an

708
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,100
its beacon why I society is at your own

709
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,410
and you can also connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your sim</font>

710
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,259
card and all of a sudden with these

711
00:37:55,410 --> 00:38:00,319
multiple independent ways of finding out

712
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:03,810
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can authenticate to the network</font>

713
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,430
the supplicant is stranded with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice</font>

714
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,430
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> heat methods and they're totally</font>

715
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,350
independent and there is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no</font>

716
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy way to choose and it might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

717
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:15,690
one of those doesn't work and the advice

718
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,480
in the document here is then simply that

719
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:19,740
if you have a choice and your first

720
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,990
choice didn't work it didn't

721
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,549
authenticate you to the network maybe

722
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,560
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run a second obsession</font>

723
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:29,010
and try this other way of connecting to

724
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network that's all I don't think I</font>

725
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,590
can can do much in terms of text in the

726
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,710
draft dextrous says if you have multiple

727
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:40,170
opportunities to use be sure to iterate

728
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:43,170
through all of them on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

729
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,820
adding this this use case of a Wi-Fi

730
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,370
network with these multiple networks

731
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,910
election identifiers I hope it gets

732
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:52,830
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> before clear hands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are well helps</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to to check but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

736
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:12,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">is at least see the case of Machiavelli</font>

network may may be supported in 3gpp

739
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:22,740
especially when they have introduced apk

740
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:25,470
and after that APK prime so the way and

741
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:29,279
and the user don't even know what is

742
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:32,730
reported by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the triple-s ever so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

743
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now it's to use a</font>

744
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:40,220
specific a notifier with prefix like a

745
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,370
zero or six depending on if you d ck or

746
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:47,250
ik prime but at least it is having a

747
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:50,089
user / the same Wi-Fi access reporting

748
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,059
manipulators it's something relevant

749
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,609
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

750
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:56,709
I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot knew enough about 3gpp but</font>

751
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:58,509
at least you have the lucky case that

752
00:39:56,709 --> 00:40:00,519
the realm identifier for both eat

753
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:04,119
methods would be the same course to be

754
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:05,709
at VG PP network org so both eat methods

755
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,170
probably terminate at the same server

756
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:12,819
and then eat method negotiation can<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

757
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,799
kick him and so yeah yeah it's using the

758
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:17,558
prefix anyway you you are able to use

759
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:19,959
the CMC but I was more speaking about

760
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the access network issues during that</font>

761
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,430
you have much cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and so on but</font>

762
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:27,098
it is something at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> so use case</font>

763
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:29,348
exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty sure we should</font>

764
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:30,880
keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> text in the draft for this</font>

765
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:32,739
extra piece of advice actually I have a

766
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,779
war story about why I actually wrote the

767
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:37,029
text that was years ago before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

768
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:38,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">was there that wasn't a potential</font>

769
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:40,559
problem of once applicant vendor but I

770
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,578
don't think it matters anymore the

771
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,459
interworking thing is the much better

772
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:48,660
reason so now have a specific question

773
00:40:45,459 --> 00:40:51,969
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been through all the</font>

774
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,249
gmail exchange recently on the

775
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:57,609
definition of the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

776
00:40:54,249 --> 00:41:00,368
identifiers so first of all is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bia not</font>

777
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:02,469
okay with the last so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the last</font>

778
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:04,839
status on that when you said so it's

779
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:07,929
means that Bernard is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with what was</font>

780
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:12,549
said or when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernard is valid</font>

781
00:41:07,929 --> 00:41:14,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ababa yeah I think he is but you would</font>

782
00:41:12,549 --> 00:41:17,769
have to confirm himself now the real

783
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:19,929
problem is that I used to turn method

784
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:21,249
specific identity for the realm

785
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:24,279
identifier which gives in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deep</font>

786
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:27,029
response because it is kind of specific

787
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:29,799
to the method but it is not the reserved

788
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,509
method specific identity and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

789
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:34,479
just the source of much confusion and

790
00:41:31,509 --> 00:41:39,939
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question for my side is what is</font>

791
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:45,489
the real so the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier so where</font>

792
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:48,160
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it used exactly but it is used</font>

793
00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:52,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be put in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ypres sponsored entity</font>

794
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,368
it is not used inside the method the

795
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:55,989
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it is something</font>

796
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:58,689
already done actually you receive

797
00:41:55,989 --> 00:42:00,640
something like at orange red car or yeah

798
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:04,439
it's pretty common deployed practice

799
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay okay thank you</font>

800
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:31,500
okay at that point we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> nearing the</font>

801
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:45,210
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation of today and that is</font>

00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the multi-point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP yeah so yeah this</font>

803
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be it should be quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah and</font>

804
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,529
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a proposal yet to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so this slide is just</font>

809
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,860
providing you the context of this of

810
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:07,770
this of this work why we are why we are

811
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:11,250
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to define why we are trying to</font>

812
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:13,110
provision this information to add to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DCP</font>

813
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,720
the overall context is that the current

<font color="#E5E5E5">transfer bed made by by vop writer is</font>

815
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:21,240
that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doctors of some network</font>

816
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,160
access technologies they are there is a

817
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,080
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide a more enhanced quality</font>

818
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,279
of experience to customers but the

819
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that for in some of the</font>

820
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">segments and some of the customers we</font>

821
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,680
can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade to exit technology to</font>

822
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:35,910
provide more bandwidth and more capacity

823
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to customers so the strategy for for</font>

824
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:46,259
some of this of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network segments is</font>

825
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:48,180
to aggregate multiple access networks so

826
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,000
that we provide an enhanced quality of

827
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,230
service to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers so one of the</font>

828
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,360
solution that that is currently

829
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,580
integrated in our project<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called MP</font>

830
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and this protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is meant to</font>

831
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:02,279
aggregate various connection that are

832
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:04,680
sent over various access networks and

833
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,870
present them as one single connection to

834
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:11,000
attitude to the customer so this is for

835
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:13,290
better quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience and bitters</font>

836
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,930
including service continuity and also

00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">they increase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them increased bandwidth</font>

00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:26,190
yeah so NP<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp in in principle is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

842
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,760
the information so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell the</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my IP addresses and my set of port</font>

845
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,130
number so that you can establish

846
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple connections and then you can</font>

847
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,370
glue all these connections so that it

848
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,990
can be perceived as watching a

849
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,370
connection but the problem is that for

850
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the service providers that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

851
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,029
control the neck the terminals and we

852
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:52,770
don't want all the servers and today the

853
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,540
current rate of the penetration of of

854
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:57,660
impedance observer is that there are

855
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,670
only few servers so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

856
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,270
to benefit from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality than</font>

857
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,950
the filter or provided by IP tcp we we

858
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,230
are currently investigating the need to

859
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:10,759
introduce any new features into the CP

860
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:12,840
itself and to introduce some dedicated

861
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,970
service functions at the network which

862
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:20,220
we call the concentrator so the overall

863
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:22,230
field overall there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> three tcp</font>

864
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,720
legs the first one between the hot the

865
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,550
internal host and the CP and disappear

866
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,250
from slate in fact the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappearin</font>

867
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:32,390
action into a multipath TCP connection

868
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,680
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data will be split into available</font>

869
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:36,330
network attachment and then the

870
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:39,120
concentrator will terminate the sessions

871
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:44,600
and then from Staten<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM into an to a</font>

872
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:48,509
TCP connection next slide please yeah so

873
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:50,490
then this document is a focusing on the

874
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:53,400
provisioning part at the network network

875
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,990
side there will be multiple in

876
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:57,180
participate contrast concentrator

877
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:59,129
instances that will be deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

878
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,230
network yet just one important aspect

879
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,760
here is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with in</font>

880
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:04,860
participate in general for all the

881
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,600
confusion is work of aggression we are

882
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,460
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one specific configuration</font>

883
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,740
which is we are controlling those

884
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">network accesses so there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conflict</font>

885
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the Khufu graph that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

886
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from various networks because we</font>

887
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,770
are controlling both the mobile one and

888
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the fix defects connection the in</font>

889
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:25,920
participation criteria is sort in a

890
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,299
triple a server this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very important</font>

891
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,940
for us because we don't want to

892
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,760
introduce another authorization

893
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,589
phase between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CP SF and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the constant</font>

894
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,510
writer and we want to leverage on

895
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:38,310
existing on existing techniques during

896
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,589
the network attachment<font color="#E5E5E5"> as both for the</font>

897
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,599
fixed and for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile itself so</font>

898
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,369
this document is about radius extensions

899
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:48,180
and not about MP disappear in general

900
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:50,099
next slide please and yet this let's

901
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,049
just summarize the rationality and the

902
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,190
design that we adopted in this in this

903
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,839
draft is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to say that we are</font>

904
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,540
following closely the recommendation

905
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:59,369
from this working group so all is

906
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,880
especially the ones which are in the

907
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">data type draft we are also avoiding</font>

908
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,950
polymorphic attributes so we are defined

909
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,859
two attributes one for ipv6 and 14 right

910
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:13,290
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> one multiple instances of the set</font>

911
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:15,328
of the same in Pacific concentrator can

912
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:20,849
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included in the in do in the india</font>

913
00:47:15,329 --> 00:47:24,780
tribute and both may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the same in</font>

914
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:27,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same message next slide please this</font>

915
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,460
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as there is nothing new there</font>

916
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing specific to attitude to the case</font>

917
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:35,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">is just to tell you how we can we are we</font>

918
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:37,799
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancelling including this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attribute</font>

919
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:40,230
in ind architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweet it will be an</font>

920
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,240
so the dhcp server or the last faction

921
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:44,550
will we contact the server then we see

922
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,500
if the customer is is ha subscribe to

923
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:48,510
the server we will contact we will

924
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,760
convey to him the information about the

925
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">HTC the concentrator ipv4 or ipv6</font>

926
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:56,310
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will be translated into a</font>

927
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,700
dedicated dhcp or dhcpv6 option so that

928
00:47:56,310 --> 00:48:01,799
the CP can use that the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

929
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:05,310
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are returned to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> active next slide</font>

930
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:09,480
please so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think yeah we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

931
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:11,430
received an interesting review from

932
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Veronica and we integrated all the</font>

933
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,690
commands that here he raised we are

934
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can will come in all the commands</font>

935
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can receive from the working</font>

936
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,880
group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would like to water</font>

937
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:31,920
progress this this item<font color="#E5E5E5"> in radix command</font>

938
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:34,170
question you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question for</font>

939
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,440
clarification first could you show this

940
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:40,859
yeah on this one it's an so you need to

941
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">send back empty CP MP TCP information to</font>

942
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:46,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client or</font>

943
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:49,109
yes okay okay this is done at adoption

944
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">dhcp and the cheaper option okay because</font>

945
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:58,500
in the first one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that the CP</font>

946
00:48:51,329 --> 00:49:04,290
for instance was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> indus said diagrams</font>

947
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:07,230
the CP is who's a mass know the dhcpv6

948
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,849
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there is no modification</font>

949
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:11,160
at this okay good it's not aware about

950
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:14,310
about about the radius exchanges<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

951
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:18,319
good and the second point was that is

952
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:21,960
this discussed somewhere else oh is this

953
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:24,420
proposal to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it is only for</font>

954
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:26,609
right this working up because this is

955
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:30,119
where reddish extensions are yeah so

956
00:49:26,609 --> 00:49:31,890
okay so Z and there is no need of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

957
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:37,440
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address of the</font>

958
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:40,020
concentrator for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP stuff to</font>

959
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,609
work you don't need so from a CP point

960
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,540
of view on Lizzie IP address will be

961
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasonable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly okay okay thank you</font>

962
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:53,040
so I also have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

963
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:54,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">same diagram so it I'm not sure where</font>

964
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,170
this information exchange that happens

965
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:02,480
in the excess acceptance here is related

966
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:04,560
to triple-a it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the being ass</font>

967
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,089
realizes oh I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send the</font>

968
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,490
HTTP option but I have no idea where the

969
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:10,710
concentrators are so it it does this

970
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,930
request just to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

971
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,060
about the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> topology not only</font>

972
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,250
about the network topology is also to

973
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:20,310
see whether this customer disappearo

974
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:21,960
rise to use the mb tcp server service

975
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,509
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an example of the use of</font>

976
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,510
the of the attribute this is not the

977
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:30,089
purpose of the draft but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font>

978
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:32,520
one example of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we plan to use it</font>

979
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is Delta Korra yeah so when you</font>

980
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,770
deploy this MPG city in the background

981
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,710
thing you do that selectively for

982
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:43,140
customers it means some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

983
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,390
some of the fe because in fact we have a

984
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,819
big group you have various diplomat

985
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,109
context and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> this feature is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

986
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:51,810
necessarily provided to all the

987
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:53,130
customers but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

988
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,080
bragging this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the purpose of the</font>

989
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,650
draft but

990
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,029
no but it raises the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so if</font>

991
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is if it's not related to</font>

992
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:03,950
authorization I didn't get your topology

993
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:07,690
information from elsewhere you don't

994
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:10,910

so it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it more question</font>

996
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:13,970
but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have the answer</font>

997
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:16,250
but do you need something<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific in</font>

00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:19,520
the request to indicate that you want to

<font color="#CCCCCC">wedge ah and they also</font>

1034
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:06,810
I i will review the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document okay thank</font>

1035
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,240
you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd be glad if we if you can</font>

1036
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:11,100
consider adding on an item in the

1037
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:16,250
shorter for this for this document so

1038
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:16,250
that will be an area code thank you I

1039
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:24,030
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion about you you</font>

1040
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,330
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the discussion at the end</font>

1041
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:29,820
because it is under the same in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">minus administration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sizing to</font>

consider if it needs to be a standard

1044
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:39,660
attributes or it could be relying on

1045
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:41,550
vendor specific attributes I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I've</font>

1046
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,799
no I've not checker already the draft

1047
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:46,230
but because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Assumption today so says</font>

1048
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,410
that it is under the same inside the

1049
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:53,100
same so it will be managed by one single

1050
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:54,540
administrator right yeah this is the

1051
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,190
activation of the MP<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappeared said</font>

1052
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,410
that mean that this information about

1053
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:00,780
the rich ability of your concentrator

1054
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:02,279
you will receive that through network

1055
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,260
has emerged by the same entity which

1056
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,670
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there won't be any conflict</font>

1057
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,380
between provision information if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1059
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,700
this is why this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important by the</font>

1060
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:15,180
point about communicating between an ass

00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:17,819
and the triple a server you you need to

1064
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:23,550
because this may be provided by

about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> relative change he's only what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you are using to configure your recipe</font>

1075
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:51,320
so the interoperability issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something which is again this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

1083
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i would also review this</font>

1084
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,810
document anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we pretty</font>

1085
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:21,420
much done and the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

1086
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:25,080
depending kind of a undone homework is

1087
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:28,560
that people here wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advance RC</font>

1088
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:32,430
6614 radios over TLS to send its track

1089
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,960
and that's nice the thing is we would

1090
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">need somebody to actually edit the</font>

1091
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,320
document slightly at some point Sam

1092
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,689
Hartman said if nobody else does it

1093
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,480
argued that Sam has moved on from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1094
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:44,400
ITF at some point and he may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1095
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,720
the time for that so document still

1096
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:51,810
lingers around and when we do update it

1097
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,660
we should also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be wary of TLS changes</font>

1100
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:01,109
could be there be some replay attacks or

1101
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,420
you just send an accounting packets

1102
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:05,100
inside radios about here less twice just

1103
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,730
begin you because you can replay it with

1108
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:25,830
was the only point I had so this is kind

00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:29,250
of an open mic for 30 seconds or

1110
