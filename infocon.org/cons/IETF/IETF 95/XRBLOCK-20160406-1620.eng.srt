list another time if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any kind</font>

66
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:02,420
of IPR considerations that we should

67
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:07,520
know about we learn to be pre-emptive on

68
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:11,110
this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then if the</font>

69
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:23,330
consensus is confirmed on the list will

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:25,670
submit to the ASG so regarding a waxy

71
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:28,490

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,740
sent a liaison statement to w3c just

73
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,680

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:37,460

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:51,050
receive any feedback on the list and as

78
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:53,599
far as I know there were no issues

79
00:05:51,050 --> 00:06:01,790

82
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,460
microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so the speaking with</font>

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,849
my chair head home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

84
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,890
hats in this string including the author

85
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,800
including makeover with viral number

86
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:31,219
stats documents but this is the chair

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:33,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands of the of the WTC work group web</font>

88
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,740
RTC which is a home of the stats

89
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,280
document we were not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure</font>

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:43,610
whether any response was really needed

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:47,119
we looked at looked at the

92
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:53,870
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lazon statement and said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

93
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:56,060
we're informed thank you so right so it

94
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,000
was for information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were kind of</font>

95
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:03,319
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that if something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,069
terribly wrong you will sate yet so

97
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:09,650
speaking with my quite personal

98
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:15,490
contributor hat on it's a bit confusing

99
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:15,489
to me whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> intended to set up a</font>

100
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:24,289
mechanism to an eye on a mechanism for

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:26,960
that you expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to influent roll the</font>

102
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:30,229
WTC document or whether you it was

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,500
parallel to the WTC document the letter

104
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,810
could be a little confusing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay where</font>

105
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">would want to address this I i can</font>

106
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,539
answer but so might take and now i'm

107
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,539
speaking also is a contributor because

108
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm a quarter of the document so</font>

109
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:52,580
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the document quite explicitly</font>

110
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:54,680
refers to the w3c stats registry cause

111
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,210
at that point in time no no it's a work

112
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,719
item<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the but it</font>

113
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:05,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually says it so we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

114
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:09,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stats as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WCC consider is</font>

115
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:13,960
important if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> rtcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XR deployed</font>

116
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:16,279
on on your end points or whatever

117
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,948
entities are gateways or whatev

118
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:24,050
identities are running on the web RTC

119
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:27,349
flow then you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is a</font>

120
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,159
way you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in your support yeah</font>

121
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:36,890
the point was so why why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

122
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:39,649
ini registry in it I mean we have you

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,049
already have all the extra blocks

124
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:45,050
registers and other documents and the

125
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:49,160
stats document is its own registry so

126
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:52,609
why say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and iono registry in here yeah</font>

127
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,189
energy she was not created for yeah well

128
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can I can try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer some of that I</font>

129
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font>

130
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:05,989
the original idea was that the web RTC

131
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:10,190
stats document<font color="#CCCCCC"> has as literals or has</font>

132
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:12,529
metrics defined in it or defines metrics

133
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:15,230
that would be used by the stats document

134
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,390
I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea within this working</font>

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,700
group was or we have the matrix but we

136
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,500
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the metric names so maybe we</font>

137
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,040
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just register the metric names</font>

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:32,740
and i think that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the premise</font>

139
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:36,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the anna registry europe damn it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

140
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,220
kind of unsure if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has an 8-bit in any</font>

141
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:44,740
benefits either we get the same names in

142
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:47,600
the stats document eventually and it has

143
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:50,029
no added benefit or we get conflicting

144
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,300
names in which way where is we have a

145
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:55,520
problem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what in which</font>

146
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,140
case it having the registry would be a

147
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,140
benefit<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not Holly in the registry</font>

148
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,910
Alyssa Cooper so if you do it that way

149
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:15,770
then in the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to add</font>

150
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:20,240
a metric what's the process and go to

151
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:22,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WJC and follow the WTC process you</font>

152
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,970
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update that document it's like a</font>

153
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,750
document process I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking at the</font>

154
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,150
moment WTC seems to be a fond of doing

155
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,920
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way yes so having having</font>

156
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,439
document updates instead of registries

157
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:42,410
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot of discussion about it</font>

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where WTC currently is so</font>

159
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,790
that's maybe that's actually there the

160
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,529
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference is the process</font>

161
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,760
that you used to do an update and

162
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:51,620
obviously with<font color="#CCCCCC"> ini get my registration</font>

163
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,360
policy and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to spin a</font>

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,360
whole new document to get a new measure

165
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:03,410
yeah so i think when we had this

166
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:07,270
discussion about two or three I etfs ago

167
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,949
and I think we added the the registry

168
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,079
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> later to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

169
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:19,130
I think the premise was to create a

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:21,110
registry in and in case the w3c ever

171
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,390
needs to know which metrics are defined

172
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,490
where they would know where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look it</font>

173
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,040
up I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the general premise</font>

174
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,720
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the discussion that Harold's</font>

175
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,599
bringing up is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font>

176
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:42,260
premise or not so I'm hoping there's

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:47,840
some feedback so Harold<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

178
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:52,850
suggesting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we not create the</font>

179
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,330
registry and then oh so they have the

180
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,230
draft list out all the metrics that

181
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend for WebRTC and then if you</font>

182
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:06,260
want to add anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> new that comes out</font>

183
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,700
of this working group will inform w3c

184
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,110
that it is a recommended metric they

185
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,800
should be added to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stars draft in</font>

186
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:16,760
WCC yesyes I think so that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly</font>

187
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,760
make the WGC<font color="#E5E5E5"> document normative and not</font>

188
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,840
create a parallel existence so this

189
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,700
document would be then be

190
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommendations from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idx ITF to the</font>

191
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:33,680
step to the author to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the WC and since</font>

192
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,420
their authors are kind of overlapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

193
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,579
think the recommendations would be

194
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,150
likely to be accepted and we would have

195
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,280
we would add a section on how to add

196
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,740
extra metrics in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft yeah</font>

197
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:51,350
basically say go Cody the stats element

198
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:54,700
and follow the procedures their genre

199
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">mechanic again speaking as a contributor</font>

200
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,600
one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe it by the</font>

201
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:04,370
time we're talking it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear</font>

202
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,220
whether it was the status<font color="#E5E5E5"> of for the</font>

203
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:10,340
type of project the breeze is taking

204
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:15,530
because at some point it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a wiki</font>

205
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:18,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">page of some kind so I believe as a</font>

206
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,120
decision to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a document was</font>

207
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:28,390
taking kind of

208
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:28,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the Z ITF decision and now I</font>

209
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:39,319
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's roughly correct so probably</font>

210
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:47,209
the liaison help the liaison actually

211
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:48,460
helped all the so Cooper so um I mean

212
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,210
there's a question here right which is

213
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:56,480
if the we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you do this</font>

214
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,060
in the w3c is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in flux then that</font>

215
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,410
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you sort of know right now</font>

216
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,969
if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a new metric in the</font>

217
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,329
future approximately what you would have

218
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do but maybe in the future that will</font>

219
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,029
change again and who knows what you

220
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:12,529
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do whereas we have I think</font>

221
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,000
fairly strong consensus of like what

222
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:15,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it mean to have the specification</font>

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,970
required with expert review and you know

224
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,779
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do and that's unlikely</font>

225
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,250
to change right so I don't know what I'm

226
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,589
not saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have any opinion I'm</font>

227
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,480
just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people reason about</font>

228
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,529
it a little bit it's but it does seem to

229
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,900
me like there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

230
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,520
certainty in terms of knowing what you

231
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,410
would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to get a new metric in</font>

232
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,750
there if you have an eye on a registry

233
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:40,550
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you get one</font>

234
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,980
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well defined and stable let's</font>

235
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,810
say exactly the argument I used to in

236
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,470
order to have an eye on a registry I'm

237
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:52,729
in the few places we need it and I lost

238
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:56,690
the argument every time in a WK z so the

239
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:00,980
so if if if I have to find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

240
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:04,310
WGC spec and WTC doesn't follow it it

241
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">creates trouble actually we can there is</font>

242
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,380
a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid this so so basically we</font>

243
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,339
can write in the instructions so I

244
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:16,370
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be a expert review or</font>

245
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:19,029
the policy will be expert review and the

246
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,160
specific instructions to the expert

247
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:26,240
actually will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to keep the document in</font>

248
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:30,160
sync with the metrics that are being

249
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,160
defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by a fabulous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> racine</font>

250
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:38,529
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I that effectively</font>

251
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,529
assess that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the IANA does is to keep</font>

252
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:44,860
an extract of the WTC whatever it is

253
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:48,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">right right but but it's also prevents</font>

254
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:52,439
also preempts a future change in policy

255
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:55,869
is that alyssa was referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so if</font>

256
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:57,879
tomorrow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> WCC changes against the</font>

257
00:15:55,869 --> 00:16:03,189
procedure to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not</font>

258
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">really normative reference or normative</font>

259
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:13,238
referential still the iron expert should

260
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:15,309
know what to do well it's so you again

261
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:17,980
again you have a conflict do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

262
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:19,719
they want to set up a conflict the

263
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,749
conflict is not currently stand

264
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,319
toe-to-toe to avoid the formalities not

265
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:29,769
trying to while keeping instructed to

266
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,988
experts to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> aligned on the content but</font>

267
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,549
that's that's quite an expanded role for

268
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,649
an expert than what we normally have

269
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:37,689
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's normally experts receive</font>

270
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,279
requests based on documents that are

271
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:40,899
being processed or people who want to

272
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,759
get things registered and it sounds like

273
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,919
what you're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the expert</font>

274
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:47,619
just proactively pays attention all the

275
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:50,559
time to what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on the w3c spec and</font>

276
00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:53,919
pulls things into the registry which I

277
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's that's definitely</font>

278
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,100
not what experts normally do right

279
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,040
experts are normally reactive they're

280
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,989
not proactive and also if that's what's

281
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,209
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the woman what's the point I</font>

282
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:07,500
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am an expert to a couple of</font>

283
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:11,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like for example the interface</font>

284
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,869
table entries<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> F entries and what we</font>

285
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:17,198
usually do is actually of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we're</font>

286
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:19,539
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing only with one organization</font>

287
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,299
but what we were dealing with smart

288
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:26,169
organization but what we really do is

289
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:27,490
actually we check sit there is a sound

290
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:32,649
the definition in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

291
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:35,710
organizations documents is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of</font>

292
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:42,250
covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> minimally formations that we know</font>

293
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:44,809
is required for interfaces yeah so do

294
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,610
you do you actually get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request</font>

295
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,918
to register something are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doing</font>

296
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,689
your active oh yeah no but so okay so I

297
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,980
guess we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get requests right but I</font>

298
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,080
thought what you were suggesting is that

299
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,029
the expert wouldn't actually receive any

300
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,730
requests are just posted you know read

301
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:01,309
the w3c document every week and keep

302
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,110
them in sync yeah because I went yeah

303
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,730
because I was imagining that six but

304
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,299
probably the primary expert would be

305
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody like Varun squeeze anyway he</font>

306
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:15,350
won't freeze there is a work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that WCC</font>

307
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:18,320
and and yeah I'm not forever well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

308
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:24,830
i I'm not kind of stuck on this and we

309
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:29,059
lost we lost our own um should we take a

310
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,259
hominis I don't know so I mean it i

311
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:35,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's going to come down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> teen like</font>

312
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:37,879
if you want to have to reference point

313
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,610
right so one in one in WPC any on a

314
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:44,869
registry because I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

315
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:46,699
expect wc2<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WC to reference our</font>

316
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:48,439
registry so it's gonna be either we're

317
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,029
gonna have to potentially having to or

318
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,340
which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

319
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:54,019
recommendation draft suggesting if in

320
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,590
future we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adding new</font>

321
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:59,779
extension or new new new metrics I mean

322
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,570
the recommendation will inform WCC I

323
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,869
think that's going to be the two I don't

324
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,990
see any and any other option yeah really

325
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:12,070
so I mean I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> theory I guess you know</font>

326
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,749
if this collaboration doesn't work and

327
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,428
and you know we decide to create a

328
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:18,049
registry because us that we feel like

329
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,119
that's the only way we can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

330
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:26,600
the draft and create a registry then I'm

331
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:29,360
assuming so the I think the simple

332
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,219
version of the harm is either keep the

333
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,320
registry section in the document or

334
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:38,600
delete this legacy section on documents

335
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,789
right okay good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um Oh what was</font>

336
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,259
anybody's gonna just you know think

337
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:47,019
anybody can turn up the volume a little

338
00:19:42,259 --> 00:19:47,019
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a small</font>

339
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,799
so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow come loud yeah</font>

340
00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:00,750
keep serving three so I'm gonna I'm

341
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:04,550
gonna I'm gonna ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for two arms keeping</font>

342
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:13,260
the registry and removing the registry

343
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:15,930
so plea so keeping keeping the registry

344
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,530
means WCC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf only to collaborate</font>

345
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:21,660
the strength the recommended metrics

346
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,220
right and delete we move in the registry

347
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,400
means the draft is going to be all about

348
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommending what metrics WCC should use</font>

349
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:35,520
and then should including their stash

350
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:40,010
draft starts document well well I go

351
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,010
we'll send out of liaison state minix I

352
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:45,390
mean the documents gonna get updated uh

353
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,570
and yeah we could send an email like

354

we should just remove the registry and

384
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:50,650
make this draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> solely a</font>

385
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:53,860
recommendation to WCC okay so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

386
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so removing the registry burn you</font>

387
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,729
wanna can you update the draft and lack

388
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,179
of the bull pen<font color="#E5E5E5"> register just curious</font>

389
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">why one person who wanted the registry</font>

390
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,429
what the concern was to keep the history

391
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,100
Rachel do you have any particular

392
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:11,320
concern about removing the base<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no</font>

393
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:16,389
it's fine was it sympathizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> guzzi</font>

394
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:21,570
editor all right we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the authors</font>

395
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:24,700
to update the draft accordingly and but

396
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">and affordable I'm curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font>

397
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,530
the recommendation should be like should

398
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:35,290
we just list at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this action</font>

399
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:39,340
the the metrics I mean the draft itself

400
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:41,520
lays out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recommended right so</font>

401
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:45,280
maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a list at the end</font>

402
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,490
saying you know yeah so this will you

403
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,620
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this patient and and the</font>

404
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,800
registry classes that's all right right

405
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:58,360
right cool that's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and make</font>

406
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:02,169
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference to the diversity</font>

407
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:09,508
see stars stars document this normative

408
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:14,169
I okay I'll do that oh okay

409
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:16,419
next the annals of next slide yeah run

410
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:18,909
even just to clarify so when if someone

411
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:21,999
would want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change to see to add some</font>

412

new so we'll add that on the world

413

decision about what to do next so but

488
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:23,880
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already been through our history</font>

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,520
evaluation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just holding a discuss on</font>

implementer community after this

496
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,879
withdrawal is actually in a worse

497
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,590
situation than they were before

498
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,380
it's not your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault it's absolutely not</font>

one who is here so that I be a

00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:19,450
terms we have at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment at the</font>

this draft under reasonable and

513
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:38,860
non-discriminatory where's with this

514
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:41,950
with this particular statement on file

515
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,590
they are so keep that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind when you</font>

516
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:47,200
asked this type of when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask this</font>

517
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,750
type of clarifications in the future not

518
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,370
addressing you Rachel I mere addressing

519
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,380
the gang here and I wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alain where he</font>

earned we're listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that maybe he</font>

521
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,910
is the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a general</font>

522
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,800
remark also it's a good idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

523
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,380
printout of that statement in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

524

if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have all read about IP are</font>

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:12,250
generally speaking while it still exists

526
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:14,020
Thank You Alyssa Cooper um so this we

527
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,540
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have a general</font>

528
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:20,830
discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPR on the ITF here but</font>

529
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:23,500
um just like to respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

530
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">point it's not obvious to me that that</font>

531
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,650
position makes a whole lot of sense

532
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to its logical</font>

533
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,570
conclusion that means that we're all in

534
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,130
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst-case scenario with most of the</font>

535
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,720
drafts that get published without any

536
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,460
IPR disclosures and the best thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

537
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody to do is like file all kinds</font>

538
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,510
of spurious disclosures on every draft

539
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,460
and that would improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation so</font>

540
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,160
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it's really the</font>

541
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,950
case that you are necessarily in a worse

542
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,960
situation now than you were before it

543
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,110
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your your own personal</font>

544
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:56,290
evaluation of the claim and its

545
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,600
applicability to this draft and again

546
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:00,700
like nobody made anybody change their

547
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:05,050
mind everybody is allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in</font>

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">defending about this so just take that</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my in as part of that your</font>

systems just an observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed</font>

552
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,070
the email that Allen had sent and I see

556
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,370
a mention in the acknowledgments section

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,439

following people who contributed to to

573
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,969
this and just ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ellen if he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

574
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:36,130
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point has been made and I</font>

575
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,139
believes it's a fair point support has

576
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:40,090
been maintained the meeting that he he

577
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,270
is a significant significant contributor

578
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:46,690
to the document even if not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> order but</font>

579
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:49,030
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> he comfortable with being thanked for</font>

580
00:34:46,690 --> 00:35:00,300
the contribution and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he may say no you</font>

581
00:34:49,030 --> 00:35:00,300
may say yes yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thanks thanks</font>

582
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:09,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and this kind of brings us to our</font>

583
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:13,830
next steps discussion right now we have

584
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">no proposal on the table for new work</font>

585
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:25,590
we entertain the discussion back like 44

586
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:29,820
ITF sessions ITF 91 and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

587
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:32,730
concluded to is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> where at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

588
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,410
in time as optimistic as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> today by</font>

589
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">next time everything will be progressed</font>

590
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:39,359
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we will not need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

591
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:40,920
meeting assuming there is new work there

592
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,260
is no there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is New York we entertain</font>

593
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">each activity there is no new work the</font>

594
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:48,720
proposal was to keep the working group

595
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:51,750
in a dormant or semi dormant state

596
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,480
meaning we don't conclude the working

597
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:57,650
group leave of course they may least

598
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,560
open for any discussions new proposals

599
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:05,160
clarifications<font color="#CCCCCC"> air artists and we have</font>

600
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,980
an open group when because we we are

601
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,629
kind of estimating that the need for new

602
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">metrics because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of new applications</font>

603
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,660
actually may arise in the future and we

604
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,650
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go through the overhead of</font>

605
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,710
chartering or the chartering a new

606
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:24,060
working group therefore the consensus

607
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:28,170
like four meetings ago Bob the chairs

608
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:32,190
discusses with the director and we tend

609
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:35,940
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way but it's our time to say</font>

610
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:40,020
if there is anything anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

611
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,840
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do something else Ronnie</font>

612
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:46,190
heaven I think we probably will need to

613
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,800
look at a whole work on the old apt

614
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking you how to continue because I</font>

615
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,580
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we created this work ago</font>

616
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,100
because we had all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack of of</font>

617
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,040
Exile blocks document i think there was

618
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,009
to a 10 or 12 documents they didn't have

619
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,259
time to go over but maybe if we try to

620
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,600
do restructure or something we can put

621
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,220
it in one of a new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

622
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,069
together with other words it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

623
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,899
we we figure the work right but there's

624
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">already a dispatch from Addis page</font>

625
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:20,840
problem almost I don't know this

626
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,840
purchase<font color="#CCCCCC"> estructuras right</font>

627
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,240
right yeah uh so i think when we talked

628
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this before it's basically like</font>

629
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,229
it's sort of what you get with a working

630
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,529
group is you get chairs as opposed to

631
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:35,960
you know not having one and these fine

632
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:38,810
people seemed willing to be Anna dormant

633
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:41,450
state of working group so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just seemed</font>

634
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:45,790
like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all that us to do is to</font>

635
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleep yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> witty way but yes there's a</font>

636
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:51,560
at the point at which apt is talking

637
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">about being done or something then not</font>

638
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,750
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flow we could talk</font>

639
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,669
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again but it's really no skin</font>

640
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:07,340
off of anybody's back was kind of the

641
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:11,000
conclusion lesson<font color="#CCCCCC"> hollis jump strictly</font>

642
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,680
as a matter of principle I to guard the

643
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,890
idea of government working groups as a

644
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,460
bad one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> finishing work should be a</font>

645
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:24,740
cause for<font color="#E5E5E5"> celebration shutting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font>

646
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:28,760
making ready for the next levels so I

647
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,220
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that argument last time and people</font>

648
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,110
seem to think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it given the nature</font>

649
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the working group it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is likely that</font>

650
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:38,000
new metrics will arise so in this case

651
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,670
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you like have to go through</font>

652
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,860
the chartering process again just to

653
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:44,860
standardize a new block like one block

654
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,299
that's that's fine I mean again I was

655
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">arguing last time that we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font>

656
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,450
the group so I'm totally ambivalent oh

657
00:38:55,990 --> 00:39:02,629
yes thanks I mean the other fault you

658
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,220
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is that you know XR if X our</font>

659
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,410
blocks weren't it's on working group it

660
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,779
would be and thoughtful i think fall

661
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:11,120
into the scope of a vtx because it's an

662
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:16,400
exception to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the apt to the RTP protocol</font>

663
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,900
so I mean not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I you know if not</font>

664
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,620
nothing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I about that I</font>

665
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:23,120
particularly need to have a zillion XR

666
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,900
blocks dropped on me but you know I

667
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

668
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,890
zillion I shower blocks so

669
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:35,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">one even that seems reasonable to do a</font>

670
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:38,560
dominant thinking in terms of just the

671
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,720
management of that that if you have a

672
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">document to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> review you want to have some</font>

673
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,029
time in the meeting then probably what

674
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:48,730
we can do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have it with one of</font>

675
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,320
the other apt<font color="#CCCCCC"> workgroups to say in the</font>

676
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,510
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeslot another night if you don't</font>

677
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">think like this is this meeting for</font>

678
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">example maybe tico we make we we said</font>

679
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,170
that we probably will want just one hour

680
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,260
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next meeting because we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

681
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,990
any more document currently so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlike</font>

682
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,880
here that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

683
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:09,729
you don't even need the whole hour then

684
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,130
we can look at having just there to do

685
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:17,590
this at the same time slot and makes but

686
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:19,660
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad so i'll come at first</font>

687
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,370
as an individual been commonly first is

688
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:26,020
an individual and then second as the

689
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:28,060
irresponsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> lady in the room the as an</font>

690
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,780
individual I kind of agree with Harold

691
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,790
and for a slightly different reason it's

692
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,680
been my experience that dormant or

693
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,259
working or working groups that don't

694
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,879
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of activity people tend to</font>

695
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:41,290
forget about and then if activity

696
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,990
happens so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying attention</font>

697
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:47,020
so it's actually often hard to get your

698
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:49,569
constituency to notice if someone drops

699
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:53,230
a a new metric you may find a whole lot

700
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:55,660
of crickets and then as the

701
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:59,500
irresponsible ad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a conversation</font>

702
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:03,129
with Magnus on a similar subject at the

703
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,110
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a BD core this morning and we see</font>

704
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,270
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion which I tend</font>

705
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:09,100
to agree with is let's just sit maybe

706
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,410
for a cycle and see where things are

707
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:15,190
because right now ABT core is looking

708
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:18,160
really quiet and accel x our block is

709
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:21,970
looking really quiet and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

710
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,730
only a vtx is got clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to do</font>

711
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,439
so we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rethink the current</font>

712
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,600
structure but it probably makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

713
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,240
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>
