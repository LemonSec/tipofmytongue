1
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:03,720
now let's stop the hour man you're right

2
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,479
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of newcomers are</font>

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:18,390
the newcomers<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could i recognize</font>

4
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:19,530
most these faces<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh we're going to</font>

5
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,110
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're at the top of the hour</font>

6
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,119
here as i was commenting a few moments

7
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago I recognize a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the faces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

8
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,320
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't see an awful lot of</font>

9
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:37,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">newcomers um who here is like new to the</font>

10
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:40,830
ITF yep I've got how about new to art oh

11
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,020
that's okay so a couple new guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:46,710
this is being recorded for posterity so

13
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,340
um and who's here to heckle yeah that's

14
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> liked about going on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

15
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,720
welcome to art this is of course covered

16
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they note well we don't really</font>

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,140
anticipate having any technical

18
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,310
conversations in here but if you do go

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone and start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

20
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything that has IPR implications</font>

21
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,369
you need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of the visions in</font>

22
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,509
BF c p 79 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's related things you</font>

23
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,760
should have seen this when you

24
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,529
registered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> really if it's to be</font>

25
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,090
discussed you should be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in</font>

26
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,209
the working group later<font color="#CCCCCC"> strip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

27
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,500
what is here yes what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is art well</font>

28
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:26,760
classically it's the expression of

29
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">creative ideas or creative expression</font>

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,340
through painting music sculpture also

31
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,260
happens to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time zone we're all in</font>

32
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,160
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Argentine time zone is</font>

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,079
listed as art and at the ITF it's also

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,540
sometimes referred to as an area review

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,459
team but the real reason we're here is

36
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,870
because there's another definition and

37
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,909
that's the applications in real time<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

38
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,189
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is applications real-time well we</font>

39
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,569
basically cover sort of the top half of

40
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,799
what's been traditionally the OSI stack

41
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,299
we hit applications and things

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,180
all the way down to even handling some

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the transport for things like media</font>

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:08,230
video and audio that kind of thing it's

45
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,440
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a new area that resulted from</font>

46
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,079
the merging of an old r I which is real

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">times application structure group and an</font>

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,840
apps or application dear a group and it

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,429
covers protocols formats and that sort

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,060
of thing for applications both real-time

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:29,310
and non real-time now right so like we

52
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,420
said for apps we cover infrastructure

53
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">long snapper with application</font>

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,549
infrastructure so this is a HTTP FTP

55
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:41,230
smtp IMAP pop3<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the things you would</font>

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:47,310
be doing today to communicate whether

57
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,310
it's email its web pages it's also the

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,580
application oh gosh I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I read</font>

59
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff so application infrastructure</font>

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:57,820
stuff so like DNS labels the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPP that</font>

61
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,619
we'll talk about later and it's also

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,230
been more traditional building blocks

63
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,489
things like ldap<font color="#CCCCCC"> auth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OAuth is</font>

64
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,540
now actually in the security group it

65
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:10,840
did start in apps things like JSON media

66
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,910
types things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and historically</font>

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rai covered things like voice and video</font>

68
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:19,060
over IP signaling and the transport as

69
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,738
well as things like instant messaging

70
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,410
using simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> xvv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those sorts of</font>

71
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:25,299
protocols and then the protocols that we

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,510
use to support those kinds of

73
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,490
time-sensitive technologies like geo

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,320
probe which could tell you where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

75
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the planet which is important for</font>

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,250
emergency<font color="#CCCCCC"> services as well as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate</font>

77
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,210
which define the protocols used to

78
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,630
communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those emergency</font>

79
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,090
services now a quick note on the meaning

80
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of real time here in in computer science</font>

81
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,320
more traditionally you'll hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>

82
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,790
referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things that have like</font>

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,419
millisecond or sub-millisecond timing

84
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,910
and and guaranteed execution time that's

85
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,349
not what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is real-time</font>

86
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,290
communications which means we're talking

87
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:01,630
about exchanging media with enough

88
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,220
latency that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have informal</font>

89
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,600
conversations over without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having you</font>

90
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,000
know say over at the end of a

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,250
transmission and generally this means

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,080
you have round trip<font color="#CCCCCC"> time its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> media on</font>

93
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,259
the order of

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">in milliseconds or less before we move</font>

95
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,169
on to the other sections of this we're

96
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,330
actually going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> diving into the</font>

97
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,948
specific work i do want to point out

98
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have any question comment</font>

99
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,090
etc please<font color="#E5E5E5"> come with a microphone at</font>

100
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,620
that time we'll have a section<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

101
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,020
end professions and answers as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but</font>

102
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,419
it works well in the moment also<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

103
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:38,430
we're happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be interrupted Gardy fat</font>

104
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:42,840
does that work right it's got number on

105
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:45,240
the top I'll shout<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um what is their</font>

106
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,609
review team for art<font color="#CCCCCC"> cold you know we</font>

107
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,650
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but we I I would love to</font>

108
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an art art right house just for</font>

109
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the name art critics critics</font>

110
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,258
would but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> app the the former</font>

111
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,349
applications group did have an

112
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,330
application apps directory and some of

113
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:05,128
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is still ongoing but there's</font>

114
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,800
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for the entire new art</font>

115
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,300
area I mean the parallel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd have</font>

116
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">an art director it I guess with an art</font>

117
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,090
director yeah yeah so now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">dive into some of the details here we're</font>

119
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the administrative</font>

120
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:19,889
things we've got in art one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first</font>

121
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:23,400
things you'll probably hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

122
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:26,759
dispatch what is dispatch well much like

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,400
we have protocols for routing data we

124
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,289
have protocols for routing work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">case that's what the dispatch of working</font>

126
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,990
group does if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have work to do that</font>

127
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,759
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in you can bring it to</font>

128
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,699
dispatch to figure out what where this

129
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,250
ought to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done whether that's here in</font>

130
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,349
an existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group whether it's a</font>

131
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,389
to spin<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a new one of our smaller</font>

132
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,250
lighter faster working groups whether

133
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:51,449
there's a need for both to figure out

134
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,360
whether this really does need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,339
progress or if the a DS think it's just

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,789
it's enough for them to just sponsor it

137
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:02,610
or if it just belongs somewhere else but

138
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,500
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said there's nothing this group</font>

139
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,270
doesn't do anything itself other than

140
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,879
figure out where work needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with</font>

141
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the exception of certain I anna action</font>

142
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,360
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something needs to be at a thai</font>

143
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,000

there this is to help people on board

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a working group that would fit</font>

and it didn't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like spinning up a</font>

at being closed like with the emphasis

on trying to do smaller you know working

internet with timing information

191
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,839
associated with it and generally you

192
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,760
have these streams of media<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

order protocol and then they're received

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,400
at the far end with something that you

199
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,620
know weights enough time for things to

200
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,480
show up reasonably reassembles them into

201
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,060
the right order and then plays them out

202
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,410
as necessary so the groups that work on

203
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,660
this historically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was all done in</font>

204
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">one working group called a</font>

205
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,889
for audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> video transport but the</font>

206
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,329
workload became somewhat larger than

207
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,889
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reasonably handled by a single</font>

208
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,560
group so a few years ago we broke that

209
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:49,290
apart into four groups we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bt core</font>

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,869
that works on sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that</font>

211
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,519
impacts the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire core protocol for</font>

212
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:57,540
example those work going on right now

213
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:03,089
for multipath RTP we have a vtx which

214
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:04,560
defines extensions to of RTP so well RTP

215
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,569
and there's a companion protocol called

216
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,689
rtcp that provides like statistics

217
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:12,240
information in the opposite direction so

218
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:15,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we might send request messages for</font>

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,360
getting a new layer on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video codec</font>

220
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:21,779
payload which defines the way to bind

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,629
new codex new audio and video codecs

222
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,550
onto the real-time transport and then XR

223
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:28,560
block which is deals exclusively with

224
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,849
rtcp and specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the types of</font>

225
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,018
reports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sends back so there's</font>

226
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,790
work going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right now for</font>

227
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:36,000
example to define statistics associated

228
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:40,889
with web rdc which we'll talk about in a

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,660
few minutes so that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the media gets</font>

230
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,279
from one end to the other we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

232
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,810
and there are actually a few different

233
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocols that do this the one that has</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">received the most work in the ITF and</font>

235
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,170

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it provides two fundamental</font>

239

me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact her server and have</font>

247
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:25,079
negotiation where our endpoints will

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,579
talk to each other and determine what

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,329
have you know which codex is going to

252
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,540
use those sorts of things what other

capabilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session can have so</font>

254
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,500
here's you know a rough network diagram

255
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:42,029
of how this is typically deployed this

256
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,740
is going to look an awful lot like email

257
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,079
to those you familiar with that we're

258
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,970
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a home server ready as a</font>

home server and I send stuff to my

260
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,339

to her<font color="#E5E5E5"> Klein</font>

262
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,449
and that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way things end up</font>

263
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,249
getting set up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only real difference</font>

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> dwai email typically works in</font>

265
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:59,490
the way that sip typically works is with

266
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,930
email she can come along at any

267
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,790
arbitrary point in the future and pull

268
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,829
this from her server whereas with<font color="#E5E5E5"> sip</font>

269
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,029
she has to be online and registered with

270
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,638
the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server has to know</font>

271
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:10,110
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to her device in real time</font>

272
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,889
you know fast enough that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can make</font>

273
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,410
her phone ring reasonably so there are a

274
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,569
lot of working groups that have spun up

275
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,160
and spun down over time dispatch came

276
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:21,329
out of the right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things so we've</font>

277
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">had a lot of working groups that were</font>

intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be small single purpose type</font>

things we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple of</font>

long-standing maintenance groups and

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:32,430
music is the great granddaddy of all

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the group that originally</font>

actually it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:17,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrates how dispatch works</font>

356
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,740
well we had a group of participants come

357
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,810
into the IETF who had previously not

358
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">done I HTF work they just knew that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

359
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,939
had these these formats they wanted to

360
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,649
have work done on in the ITF and then

361
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:33,449
formal specifications published for them

362
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:34,920
so they came in to dispatch and within a

363
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,599
relatively short period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time got a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">working group and what they're working</font>

365
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,790
on is standardizing a couple of lossless

366
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:44,040
formats ffb one is a lossless video

367
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:48,420
codec black is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lossless audio codec</font>

368
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,069
and then matroska which is a container

369
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,939
format for storing these sorts of things

370
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:57,000
like on<font color="#CCCCCC"> discs as well as the binding</font>

371
00:15:53,939 --> 00:16:00,240
between that container and the protocols

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,790
themselves the<font color="#CCCCCC"> codex themselves we also</font>

373
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,250
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mostly done working group called</font>

374
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,639
codec this was the first codec work we

375
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,829
did in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ICF so the name was codec it</font>

376
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,139
developed a wideband audio codec called

377
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,388
opus where the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

378
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:17,400
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was state-of-the-art or</font>

379
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:21,900
better and

380
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:23,760
believed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be royalty free and they met</font>

381
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,020
the actually met both of those goals

382
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,069
they met the first goal with flying

383
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">colors there's it's hard opus is</font>

384
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,980
probably the best audio codec out there

385
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:36,750
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment it's still</font>

386
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,170
believed by most people to be royalty

387
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,240
free so it met its goal net bc is going

388
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:45,900
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now where the goal is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

389
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,720
same sort of thing for video codecs so

390
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,090
we're developing next-generation video

391
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,950
codec we're actually meeting this week

392
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,010
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that sort of thing come by</font>

393
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,840
I'm advertising it because on the chair

394
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:00,120
it is a lot of math it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of math</font>

395
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,620
yes sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with one of the guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

396
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,420
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually working on the code and</font>

397
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,010
they're more than happy to explain this

398
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,899
stuff to you and you will learn about

399
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:12,959
entirely new branches of mathematics you

400
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,459
probably didn't know before ah perk so

401
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,470
this one is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my heart I'm</font>

402
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,180
not not sharing it but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

403
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">some really cool work that's going on</font>

404
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:23,640
right now so there's privacy enhanced

405
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:28,530
communications is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the working group</font>

406
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:32,160
is called and it was chartered develop

407
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,139
protocol extensions to mostly RTP than

408
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,560
the other protocols sort of in that area

409
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that allow multi party conferences to be</font>

410
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,750
encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to end and there's also</font>

411
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,460
some work that's going to go on

412
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,390
networking group to show exactly how to

413
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,380
work that in sip WebRTC and clue which

414
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,790
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working groups I didn't</font>

415
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:58,940
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its telepresence using</font>

416
00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:01,170
sip protocols so in a traditional

417
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,120
multi-party conference you have a

418
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,190
conference server in the middle and if

419
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,320
it's enlightened enough to be an

420
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,030
encrypted conference which is actually

421
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really state-of-the-art right now</font>

422
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,149
but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are you know blocking</font>

423
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,820
these things down then you have

424
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,640
encrypted connections between all the

425
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,800
participants and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference server</font>

426
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,220
but the conference server necessarily

427
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,409
has access to the media in this set of

428
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,150

429
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:28,770
use drop on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation if it wants</font>

430
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's great if it's in a trusted</font>

431
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,450
domain but

432
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,969
more frequently you're seeing hosted

433
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,190
services for these kinds of things where

434
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,660
the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> server is trusted to</font>

435
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,059
handle the conference but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

436
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily trusted with the contents of</font>

437
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:48,289
the media and that's the problem that

438
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">perk is being set up to address so and</font>

439
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:52,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">this really is a simplified view of how</font>

440
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:56,039
this all works but the general idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

441
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:59,130
that we have a key management function

442
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,750
that resides in a trusted domain and it

443
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,390
hands out the encryption keys to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

444
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,250
participants and they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

445
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,140
encrypt the media that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're sending</font>

446
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,539
to each other but the conference server

447
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,309
doesn't have access to those keys now

448
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,299
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some keys that the endpoints</font>

449
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:14,070
use with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference server to</font>

450
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:16,530
encrypt the parts that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>

451
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,210
server needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and then potentially</font>

452
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,668
change but which you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily</font>

large so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it important like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

455
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,169
you have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font>

456
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,700
architectures where the conference

457
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">server itself can reside in the middle</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a network in potentially an untrusted</font>

460
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,039
enterprise use cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

461
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,510

enterprise domain this key management

463
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,400
function which ensures that the cloud

464
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,230
service doesn't have access to you know

465
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,049
proprietary corporate information and

466
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,330
then for public<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet services we're</font>

467
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:52,620
making certain that the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> perc</font>

468
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,360
also allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this key</font>

management function and co-located with

470
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,770
one of the endpoints which means that

471
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if they're only three people in</font>

472

decode the media those the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only people</font>

475
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,919
with the keys so this would be

476
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,470
applicable in like a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,970
service that you know has a mixer in the

479
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,809

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">most interested in for this kind of</font>

00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:23,879
thing which<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes us to web RTC so one</font>

482
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the other interesting work groups</font>

483
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,539
that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had going on recently</font>

484
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,530
although this is actually relatively

485
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:33,720
mature nowadays is web RTC which defines

486
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,480
the protocols for doing voice and video

487
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,820
calls inside browsers as well as

488
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,740
real-time data that you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,330
support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or to do things like you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">know real-time online multiplayer gaming</font>

491
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,610
what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is because</font>

492
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it covers web browsers there's actually</font>

493
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,610
a significant amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work needs to</font>

494
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:55,770
happen between the web browsers and the

495
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,209
content that runs in them as well as a

496
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,030
lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to happen between the</font>

497
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:01,440
web browsers and the network so this has

498
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a cooperative effort between the</font>

499
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,230
IETF and the w3c<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the w3c is working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">on the web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap eyes and the IETF is</font>

501
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,950
working on the stuff that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

502
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network like the social negotiation</font>

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,879
sctp which is what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for that that</font>

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,880
real-time data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

507
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I covered all of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

508
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,100
last bullets will interesting one so

509
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,390
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of dealing with sip there</font>

510
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,639
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a number of things that have</font>

511
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of developed as known best</font>

512
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,180
practices at least in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF they're</font>

513
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:44,520
not necessarily well deployed but the

514
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,550
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> pardesi effort incorporated these as</font>

515
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:51,420
mandatory so for example there's no way

516
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:54,330
to send unencrypted RTP with WebRTC it's

517
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,590
all encrypted using<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS srtp so you</font>

518
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,610
basically have you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tippy helmet</font>

519
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,409
handshake between the two endpoints

520
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,280
which means that if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone in</font>

521
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:04,110
the middle you're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

522
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,610
detect it and we also use ice which I

523
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">said we use for nat traversal but it</font>

524
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,169
also serves the important purpose of

525
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,699
determining that the far end wants to

526
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,680
receive the media<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're about to</font>

527
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,560
send them otherwise you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

528
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:19,650
blasting UDP at arbitrary people on the

529
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,770
network and this could easily be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to</font>

530
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,600
build a very effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser-based</font>

532
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,600
happen in terms of adoption there it's

533
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,389
not standardized yet obviously but we're

534
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,459
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> close and we have opera firefox</font>

535
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,620
and chrome already have priests and

536
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,990
implementations of this and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

537
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,179
well you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up there but edge</font>

540
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,959
an apple mouthpiece the WebKit page also

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">or formerly apps and one of the biggest</font>

547
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,700
ones that we have in apps was HTTP for

548
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,699
those that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may or may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be familiar</font>

549
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that what what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it's</font>

550
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,960
respect it's a request response protocol

551
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,610
so the client makes a request the server

552
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,160
comes back with a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

553
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:22,370
especially true in our HTTP 1.0 and 1.1

554
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,020
is usually done over port 80 and

555
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,689
hopefully that's going away for 443 and

556
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,790
TLS everywhere but it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been used as</font>

557
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,070
transport for many many new things that

00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,730
are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> along there's many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

559
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,139
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go through that the in order</font>

560
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,460
to pass the data around instead of it

561
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,170
coming up with their own transport layer

562
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,960
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just building on top of</font>

563
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:47,430
HTTP and so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the first</font>

564
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions are often often going to be</font>

565
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,690
asked if your brain your work is well

566
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:55,230
why didn't you use HTTP if you're doing

567
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:58,320
a request-response most of this has been

568
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,290
handled by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> https working group so</font>

569
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,659
they're the ones that first sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

570
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:07,230
formalized HTTP 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot one updated that</font>

571
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,600
for the cover all the errata and issues

572
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:13,320
everybody's found they've also worked on

573
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:17,879
h2 so you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of h2 HTTP two as</font>

574
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,480
taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core of the core ideas of</font>

575
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,940
HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and providing essentially</font>

576
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,530
multiplexing so clients can ask for

577
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,360
multiple things at one time if the

578
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,250
client asks for something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

579
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,899
knows that that one thing really you're

580
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:33,960
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need for more things it could</font>

581
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,180
start sending those to you without

582
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,880
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously without direct pushing</font>

583
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,220
of it without directly asking for it

584
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,350
it's also helped with header compression

585
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:46,680
so to reduce the size of each request

586
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,050
response these guys have also worked

587
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,080
very closely with the TLS working groups

588
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:54,780
there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that because</font>

589
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,510
of how HTTP works it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

590
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,860
helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this in TLS they've</font>

591
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,810
worked with the TLS working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

592
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,729
that core protocol there and there's

593
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,220
been things that TLS<font color="#CCCCCC"> is made sure would</font>

594
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,230
play nice with HTTP when they've come

595
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,179
about so the to do work very<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely</font>

596
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,059
together even if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not this is one</font>

597
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:14,600
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same so</font>

598
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:17,809
things that do work with or use relate

599
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,998
to http we've got CD and I so this is

600
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:24,408
taking content delivery networks that's

601
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:26,659
the Occam eyes and the other cat global

602
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:27,919
caches and and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way that</font>

603
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">these guys could talk together that's</font>

604
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,299
what this working group is for there's

605
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:36,169
also web push so you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

606
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:39,830
as the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of enabling the things you</font>

607
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:41,570
get today with a P&S and GCM for pushing

608
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,949
data to your phone making that

609
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:47,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web based applications</font>

610
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,509
some more things to deal with HP you're

611
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:52,549
looking to be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> our core so this is</font>

612
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:56,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">iot over something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks an awful</font>

613
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:58,220
lot like HTTP they are four reasons to

614
00:25:56,059 --> 00:26:00,320
keep it you know fitting within the

615
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,450
constraints of very small low power low

616
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,049
memory devices they've taken some things

617
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">press even further for their use cases</font>

618
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:10,429
although there are some mapping they are

619
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">working defining a mapping to http of</font>

620
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:14,840
their of their<font color="#E5E5E5"> work there's also skin so</font>

621
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could think of this as user some</font>

622
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:21,350
directories over HTTP so this is often

623
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">used between say large organizations to</font>

624
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,389
populate a you know a cloud service with

625
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:28,429
their users and what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups those</font>

626
00:26:26,389 --> 00:26:30,860
users long in and help share that data

627
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:34,340
in a relatively quick and searchable

628
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:38,449
manner then there's also TZ<font color="#E5E5E5"> dist which</font>

629
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,639
is actually closing down this week this

630
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:44,090
was time zones so this is past my under

631
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:46,008
each time zone database files over HTTP

632
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,080
so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying on your package</font>

633
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:50,210
manager to hopefully someday update that

634
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,340
when some government somewhere decides

635
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,570
time zones now going to be this this is

636
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,499
one way to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass the information</font>

637
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,730
around in a more timely fashion the

638
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:01,490
other thing that we've also dealt with

639
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,929
more in our apps and now art has been

640
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,840
data format so we heard some things

641
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:09,049
about data formats for real-time media

642
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,019
the Codex well we have similar thing

643
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:15,408
more broadly here<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes we're all</font>

644
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:17,419
pretty familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content like</font>

645
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:19,129
when you're making that HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request and</font>

646
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:22,389
that that stuff you get back with that

647
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">content you're pushing or posting up</font>

648
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:26,000
work very quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's thing</font>

649
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,590
like JSON that's your content types

650
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,320
that's your content but there's also

651
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,730
other places but its context for this so

652
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,129
things like saying our media types or

653
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">link relating to language there's also</font>

654
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:43,340
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we identify how we tag these things</font>

655
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:45,140
the URLs the paths the domain labels

656
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,760
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all data formats and these are</font>

657
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,390
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that do get worked on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

658
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:52,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">art one of the biggest ones still around</font>

659
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:56,480
is JSON related ones so there's the JSON

660
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,290
this working group that was taking the

661
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,710
original well now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standards</font>

662
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:06,190
track 7159 and updating this for fixing

663
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:08,240
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> errata and aligning better with</font>

defines<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript the making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,630
everything lines correctly with them

667
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,370
we're covering you could kind of sort of

668
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,320
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this as what we've done is the</font>

669
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,510
over the wire stuff and they were

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:30,560
alignment now and going on we also

674
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,660
building on top of that have geo<font color="#CCCCCC"> JSON</font>

the preparation and comparison of

international a string so this was a

688
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,050
spiritual<font color="#CCCCCC"> successor to string prep once</font>

689
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,760
we realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem was even</font>

690
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,200
harder than<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all imagined and we were</font>

realizing it's even harder<font color="#CCCCCC"> than we've</font>

imagined the second time around but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

693
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,540
idea is if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting strings from</font>

694
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,640
other places how can I see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

695
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,980
matches something in my database well

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,410
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say well if the octet</font>

697
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:29,210
Saul lineup but everybody types things

698

differently especially if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

validation rules so most common one is

usually DNS registrar's when you enter a

00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:51,199
your end this this is defining what you

know uniform resource names look like

00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:53,510
right

have touched on is applications deal wat

764
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,720
with security whether it's real time

765
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,790
whether it's email whether it's some of

do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this work and see how it</font>

771
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,570
directly relates to applications being

772
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:36,889
done here it's mostly since we are

focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how we are getting bits</font>

around<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it seemed to have made sense</font>

775
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,070
put these groups here so groups like

776
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,960
Utah or using TLS with applicant

777
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,270
applications they started off by

778
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,940
defining the best practices of how TLS

779
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,889
should be applied to your application

780
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,929
whether it be HTTP although a lot of

781
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:57,470
that focus happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be this but</font>

782
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:59,809
also things like XMPP and moving forward

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">how this relates to the various pieces</font>

784
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:05,420
of email with submission with your

also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> v-mart what this is my</font>

understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> though some people here</font>

789
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:20,030
might correct me here how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

790
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,530
essentially how to know that email<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

791
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,809
coming from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain that it was being</font>

792
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">delivered from and there's a number of</font>

793
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,990
pieces here that deal with if that

794
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,879
doesn't match up what should I be doing

795
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:33,140
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this hard error is this</font>

796
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,870
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need the flag is it</font>

797
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's the core protocol</font>

798
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,870
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been defined but this working</font>

799
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,570
group is spinning up to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

800
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,309
some edge case well so not so some edge

801
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,919
cases are actually fairly common things

802
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:47,899
the redirect what we what they call the

803
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,429
redirect the indirect flows things like

804
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,870
I send<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a mailing list this mailing</font>

805
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:53,090
list for words it out to a thousand

806
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,320
people well that didn't come for me

807
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,820
directly didn't come from my email

808
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,649
server directly came through this mailer

809
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,990
how do I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

810
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:02,030
there's also some forwarding services

811
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,309
and this is so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is trying to</font>

812
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">address concerns there on how to make</font>

813
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,550
sure this will email

814
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,170
is coming from a legitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> party even</font>

815
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:13,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">though it came through this indirect</font>

816
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:19,389
route also<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it related to security</font>

817
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:22,010
is d bound or domain boundaries in a nut

818
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:25,790
the primary question they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

819
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:28,250
answer is is the administrator for a

820
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,480
domain say food example calm is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

821
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:32,780
administrator for that the same as

822
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">example.com for a lot of us would say</font>

823
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,670
well yes it turns out it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not anywhere</font>

824
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,679
near that simple traditionally we've

825
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:41,830
used something called the domain suffix

826
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,149
list try to figure out whether something

827
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:48,139
where those kind of administrative

828
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:49,670
boundaries existed however that that

829
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:51,529
only helps for things like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

830
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,659
these the top-level domains it doesn't

831
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">help us in cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we may have a</font>

832

hosting provider that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowing us to</font>

833
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,480
have a name first a banding name under

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:04,100
their system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are they the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that</font>

are administrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lyra sponsible for it</font>

836
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,990
is the owner of the subdomain one

responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> today we don't actually know</font>

838
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:15,080
people take guesses and they're usually

839
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:16,490
wrong so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what this working</font>

840
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,990
group is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to help define what</font>

841
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,089
those boundaries are so that clients can

842
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,609
figure this out the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct impacts</font>

843
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,560
are to web browsers so things like

844
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:26,060
cookies is this is it okay for me to be

845

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,490
might be okay for food OCH example coms

848
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,230
cookies along there it may be okay for

849
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:39,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">example.com if they're in the same</font>

00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:41,480
administrative zone they're not that

851
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,070
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a leak</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that could be us very</font>

852
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,410
serious privacy leak and possibly even

853
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,660
other problems the other one that's very

854
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,029
important is validating certificates

855
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:53,120
today we match on the whole name if

879
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:50,800
dealing with security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> port or the</font>

880
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,720
captive portal interaction so we've just

881
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">about everybody here has traveled so</font>

882
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,339
we've all experienced these captive

883
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:01,669
portals these are the hotel wireless the

884
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:05,359
internet cafe wireless these are

885
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,890
networks that are highly restricted for

892
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:24,859
however today this seems to work but it

893
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,000
works because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks so much like man</font>

894
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:31,490
and middle attack that well it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> madame</font>

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,720
sitting in the middle trying to capture

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my traffic today those look</font>

901
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,520
identical the one of the goals of this

902
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:49,160
working group is to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

903
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,050
how we can have those announcements how

904
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,029
clients can figure out that they're

905
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,530
connecting in such a network and how

906
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:56,150
they can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that Network you know</font>

907
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,160
what is the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to go to to do</font>

908
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">login what are the capabilities of this</font>

909
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,240
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of network these kinds of things</font>

910
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,290
this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> another group I don't think</font>

911
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,790
they've made a terrible amount of

912
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:08,180
progress so if this sounds very

913
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:12,980
interesting please go join the mailing

914
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:17,419
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to them about it now we're</font>

915
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting into some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that don't all</font>

00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,619
don't always fit together<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

917
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,650
traditional things for applications even

918
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:28,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">before HTTP in some ways so one of these</font>

919
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,440
is protocols for email right now there's

920
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,070
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really one working group other than</font>

command<font color="#CCCCCC"> and imap work better for uploads</font>

924
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,460
from clients so that you know right now

925
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:44,590
their clients have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lot of</font>

926
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,210
guessing whether file up whether a

927

message upload is going to work or not

928
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,990
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help provide them some clues</font>

929
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:52,500
that can be more efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> with things</font>

930

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now there's no other</font>

specifically but if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

come forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> if part would be the best</font>

935
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,410
of an additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol bucket</font>

936
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,490
something called EPP which I wasn't

<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with until I started putting</font>

938
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,149
this deck together it's kind of a quiet

939
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,040
little protocol that is extremely

940
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,630
important it runs between basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

941
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,509
domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> registrar's and the domain</font>

942
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:22,720
registries where you know for example if

943
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:25,540
i go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> joker com to register a domain</font>

944
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,379
name they have to go around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

945
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:31,360
the dot-com registrar but registry to

946
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,550
say i am reserving this one of my user

947
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:35,650
so no one else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have it that's what</font>

948
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,810
EPP is in charge of this work was done

949
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:42,430
quite a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago in apps and nowadays</font>

950
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,870
there's EDP well<font color="#CCCCCC"> AVX just became reg ex</font>

951
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,149
time actually not certain what the

952
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,799
transition was done for but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

953
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,720
are working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing as far as</font>

954
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can tell which base the extensions DVP</font>

955
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,850
protocol to accommodate new use cases so

956
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:56,259
for example one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the more interesting</font>

957
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:59,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across here is that</font>

958
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:03,070
we have some registries that require

959
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:07,090
that you get two names at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time</font>

960
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,230
there's a dot with NGO and ong and if

961
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,820
you read or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> under one you must</font>

962
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,950
have it under the other one now

963
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,900
historically<font color="#CCCCCC"> EVP is required you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deflect</font>

964
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,799
register these independently and so one

965
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,900
of the things that working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

966
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,940
is a way you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a monolithic I</font>

967
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,520
need these domains and they either

968
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:24,970
succeed or fail together so that you can

969
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:29,440
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol help with the policies</font>

970
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and that's</font>

971
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,270
it that that's sort of every working

972
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,440
group we have everything we've been
