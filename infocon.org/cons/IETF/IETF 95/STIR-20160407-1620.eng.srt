3
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:35,710
taker we would like a backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> note-taker</font>

4
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,710
somebody volunteer to do that please

5
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:50,120
please while you're thinking about it

6
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:56,119
can the how about a jabber scribe can

7
00:02:50,120 --> 00:03:01,340
somebody do that for us thank you note

8
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:19,570
taker back up please<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sony's going to</font>

9
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:23,600
take notes anyway move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay genius</font>

10
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:29,500
feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to clarify what</font>

11
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:32,000
they want captured all right don't you

12
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right this is our agenda for this</font>

13
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,910
afternoon we have pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much one draft</font>

14
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:43,579
we're going to be going through

15
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:45,530
certificates with John I suspect that

16
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,660
we've lost you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know quite a lot of</font>

17
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:56,440
spectators to other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

18
00:03:47,660 --> 00:04:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in this slot anybody have any</font>

19
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,230
last-minute agenda batches John if you

20
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,620
could work your way up<font color="#CCCCCC"> while we'll start</font>

21
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">your slides</font>

22
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:32,300
ah getting towards the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weeks</font>

23
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,969
kinda nice right how many sessions we

24
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,490
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> left like gore I think first bits</font>

25
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,009
and bytes tonight pretty nice pretty

26
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,000
mellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the few the</font>

27
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:45,440
devout here to help out with us stir

28
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,910
hopefully though this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be pretty</font>

29
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,580
uneventful because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

30
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,639
going to say anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that has not</font>

31
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,960
been architected now over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past few</font>

32
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,370
months as we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had interims and</font>

33
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,370
revisions these documents to try to

34
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,410
better understand how to align our work

35
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,229
with a practical deployment strategy

36
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,270
when it comes to certs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think based</font>

37
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,190
on discussions that Chris and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

38
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,380
about the ongoing work and add us on sit

39
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">on shaken and our attempt to kind of</font>

40
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,400
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the best aggregate is</font>

41
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,340
and we have a good kind of consensus

42
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:21,049
story we can tell here first or service

43
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,849
today yep so the new version there was

44
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,259
the last time we thought we would go to

45
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:26,210
the trouble of putting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new</font>

46
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,070
the main thing we really did in this

47
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,989
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we divided the</font>

48
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,460
description of certificates<font color="#CCCCCC"> in into in</font>

49
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,930
the draft in to be sick approaches and

50
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,138
neither these approaches are presented

51
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,460
as being necessarily better than the

52
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,960
other I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have hard edges</font>

53
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,380
on them their advantages and<font color="#CCCCCC"> his badges</font>

54
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">as both in fact they're presented in a</font>

55
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,310
way I'd say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not entirely</font>

56
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,139
incompatible and we can imagine a

57
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,030
migration path that actually would allow

58
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,830
these two approaches to ultimately merge

59
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,989
going forward and I'll talk a bit about

60
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,280
that but otherwise I mean there's very

61
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,139
little different<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

62
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,489
four mechanisms that we had and that the

63
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:03,229
prior version of the draft are still

64
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,550
there and I think hopefully we're

65
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,810
getting pretty close to done there are a

66
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,550
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outstanding issues we are</font>

67
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,770
going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about towards the</font>

68
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're pretty close</font>

69
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,370
excellent so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the two</font>

70
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:18,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">approaches writ large I mean we know</font>

71
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,050
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole RFC 4474</font>

72
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,669
business we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signing mechanism</font>

73
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,979
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the identity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> header that it defines</font>

74
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:27,229
we know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the passport object</font>

75
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:28,820
which gives you what all the

76
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,440
critical headers and claims are that

77
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,409
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to prevent</font>

78
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,400
impersonation in these calls really now

79
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,320
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at what the</font>

80
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,780
credentials are going to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

81
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign those things and that</font>

82
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,099
could be clear none that signaling part

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,599
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a change based on what we do with</font>

84
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,370
these credentials I mean other than you

85
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what may appear in like the x5 you</font>

86
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,050
field or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something in passport</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

87
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,760
actually identifies the search itself so

88
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,640
we're talking here about ways to use

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,190
certs that are either certs where the

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,560
subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifies the number holder</font>

91
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,520
that's the first approach and the second

92
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,610
differential is where where their

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,620
certificate exists to identify the held

94
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,900
numbers and this is a very important

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,970
distinction to grasp here when we talk

96
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,169
about you know certificates typically we

97
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,330
think of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> as having a subject</font>

98
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,590
although for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pki case which is</font>

99
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,240
the case we're almost familiar with

100
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,520
actually the subject most frequently

101
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,680
appears in the subject all name field of

102
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,060
an x.509 certificate that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

103
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,220
domain name will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there will actually</font>

104
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,660
be checked when you're making a<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

105
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,450
about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to trust the sir</font>

106
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:32,030
you've been passed down through TLS when

107
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,620
you're connecting up to a website but of

108
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,539
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's all kinds of potential</font>

109
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,090
administrative or contact information

110
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,460
that can appear in<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 beyond just a</font>

111
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,400
domain name like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is comcast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

112
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,320
here as an example maybe it could be a

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,039
telephone network specific identifiers

114
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:51,590
in some instances like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> speedy em those</font>

115
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,780
could in turn be encoded as domain names

116
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in fact appear in the subject alt</font>

117
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,150
name field of<font color="#CCCCCC"> desert or they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

118
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,860
some new certificate extension we

119
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,750
defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's just syntax I</font>

120
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,340
mean the real semantic distinction of

121
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,500
this approach is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to talk</font>

122
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the numbers themselves in the cert</font>

123
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,640
at all held numbers are not a component

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the first approach it really</font>

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">just identifies the subject which is</font>

126
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,060
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that it has or some</font>

127
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,860
surrogate identifier for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

128
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,870
like a spit and to be clear network

129
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,250
might have many spits right and so we

130
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,780
would then have some sorts of and have

131
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,760
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> skids in them or perhaps we would</font>

132
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,099
have speed specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> service or all kinds</font>

133
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,780
of like ways to tune that to what

134
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,250
operators might want to do with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

135
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level that's the first approach</font>

136
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,080
the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one that we</font>

137
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,000
originally stressed and the stir sir

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,849
proposal which is one where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,349
downplay identifying the subject

140
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:45,440
and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more focused on the certificate</font>

141
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,839
being a way for you to ascertain what

142
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,000
the set is of held numbers that are

143
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,560
associated<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the cert and there are a</font>

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,930
couple of different certificate

145
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,268
extensions that might carry this either

146
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">by reference or x value within the cert</font>

147
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,810
and there are various trade-offs

148
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,579
associated with that but the big

149
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,869
property it gives you is that the cert

150
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,209
really doesn't even need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a clear</font>

151
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,519
subject and this is a requirement that

152
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">we discussed early on and stir that let</font>

153
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">us down this path because there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

154
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:14,329
of concern about potentially leaking I

155
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,790
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say private information but</font>

156
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:18,949
proprietary information perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

157
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,290
companies by revealing that inserts

158
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:23,300
themselves do people here get the

159
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,130
distinction that we're drawing anybody

160
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,839
seeing this doesn't understand what the

161
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,839
two approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they were documenting</font>

162
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,509
in the snow I see people nodding their

163
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,860
heads people if you cared you get this

164
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,069
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care you're not to nod</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

165
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,810
head I promise I mean it'll have a

166
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,639
subject right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean a sense of their</font>

167
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,258
there or<font color="#E5E5E5"> XY by knowing fields and so on</font>

168
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,410
but that subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not actually there</font>

169
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:47,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to identify the carrier ostensibly and</font>

170
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,370
i'll talk to actually about ways of

171
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:51,529
course you could migrate from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

172
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,000
to the second you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could take a cert that</font>

173
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:55,339
has a clear subject like that and then

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,569
add to it whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> these extensions are</font>

175
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,269
that help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify the health</font>

176
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:01,189
numbers yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy</font>

177
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,230
these two approaches as you know

178
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:04,730
specifying number ownership directly

179
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,829
versus indirectly the second option

180
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,529
speaks directly to authority to speak

181
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,439
for a number in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first case there's</font>

182
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,600
some implicit claim of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of IM</font>

183
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:18,019
signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a passport object or</font>

184
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,759
something like that the binding<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right</font>

185
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:22,310
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> is less obvious that's easy to</font>

186
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,779
verify yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again yeah it so</font>

187
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,310
we'll talk we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this and</font>

188
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:26,959
disadvantages these two approaches yes

189
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,279
is dead simple if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a number in</font>

190
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,689
the syrup and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

191
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:31,759
passport be able to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out should</font>

192
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:34,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> circus signed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without that some</font>

193
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,079
kind of look up<font color="#CCCCCC"> this require yes so I</font>

194
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,880
mean this seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like probably reason one</font>

195
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,319
has on me but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can help clarify</font>

196
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,139
our site<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me it looks like that's</font>

197
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:46,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">like an authorization list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include spits</font>

198
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:48,500
right on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess is that was</font>

199
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:51,079
one way we were right so in the way that

200
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,399
we have initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> find semantics we were</font>

201
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,099
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accommodate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to start with</font>

202
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,750
right and the second

203
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,540
approach I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just a syntactic</font>

204
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">leftover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay second approach so that</font>

205
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,800
the other thing to do though you can

206
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,508
imagine just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as easily having a domain</font>

207
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:10,508
name that is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yeah 1535</font>

208
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:12,040
xvid nanpa<font color="#CCCCCC"> com</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right and like</font>

209
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:13,630
having this bitch just be included and

210
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,949
good stuff to call him<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way why</font>

211
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,870
guess that was sort of my point was it

212
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:19,060
seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like seems like all</font>

213
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,430
the all the referenced one it seems like

214
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:24,310
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists for reference a</font>

215
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,719
list should be a listen listen listen

216
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,729
numbers you in one place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things that</font>

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">are just pointers to identity to another</font>

218
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,509
place but I wouldn't try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> merge them</font>

219
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,269
yeah i think is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the exceptional</font>

220
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:36,130
out of it for anyone listening remote

221
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:39,009
and couldn't figure it out that was

222
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:43,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">ecker Erica</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Scola</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Mike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before him was</font>

223
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:44,709
richard barnes it still it's really hard

224
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what is about the acoustics</font>

225
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:50,138
in there for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like hear people that</font>

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:53,889
are out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> my tears yeah it's really</font>

227
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:55,000
good anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

228
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:55,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">get let's go to the next slide we'll</font>

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,490
talk a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what some of the</font>

230
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,529
advantages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> disadvantages that a few</font>

231
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,600
roaches are this of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> just exists</font>

232
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,420
to remind everyone here who might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

233
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
following stir super closely what the

234
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,899
basic architecture is some kind of

235
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,839
logical authorities can be provisioning

236
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,800
these credentials down<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably into</font>

237
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,180
things like intermediaries

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,089
intermediaries are going to be doing

239
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,939
assigning her quest we call this the

240
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication service function of stir</font>

241
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,849
typically done in your community area

242
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">though we also show an example here what</font>

243
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,319
it's done in like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PBX endpoint you</font>

244
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:28,269
imagine IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> PBX doing it but at the end</font>

245
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:29,589
of the day the logical authority at the

246
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,329
top is with responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for making sure</font>

247
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:33,490
you get the credentials this is

248
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,199
unchanged<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think between the two</font>

249
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">approaches there's going to be some kind</font>

250
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of authority that's doling out search</font>

251
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,120
for this and it may be that it looks a

252
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,740
lot like a traditional web Authority if

253
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,639
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just operating on traditional DNS</font>

254
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,790
names right but nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the way</font>

255
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,680
that we do the actual signatures and

256
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,819
identity headers and things like that is

257
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,670
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be substantially altered by</font>

258
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:59,889
this yes um sorry more question<font color="#CCCCCC"> gee um</font>

259
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,010
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest there's a billy d rekt to</font>

260
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:04,809
have a reference rather than a you know

261
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:06,080
rather than entity itself is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion</font>

262
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,120
is that is that particularly for

263
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,640
impression or so also for for

264
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,320
flexibility I think it so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

265
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,180
couple of strategies and I think we have

266
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,220
thought about this that we use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

267
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">reference one of them is much more like</font>

268
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">an interrogation system where you to say</font>

269
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,620
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular certificate is this</font>

270
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">number within its scope right and</font>

271
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,450
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has different you know</font>

272
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,950
semantics for preserving proprietary

273
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,240
information than saying could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please</font>

274
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,470
tell me all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone numbers</font>

275
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,910
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know within the scope</font>

276
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,740
of authority of the certificate<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

277
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,390
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off and I think there</font>

278
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,360
are actually implementation environments

279
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,430
i can imagine working big right services

280
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might want to subscribe to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rock</font>

281
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,239
this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so they pick a local</font>

282
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,600
database and so I don't wanna rule that

283
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,780
out right so the concern you get at is

284
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,500
the referential integrity of the

285
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,089
information namely that um that it won't

286
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,280
impact upon the data directly in

287
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,770
client's difficult a signature not

288
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,780
covered by some<font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTPS dereference and so</font>

289
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,540
if the property your company obtained is

290
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:08,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> merely that you only want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

291
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,410
some of the records as opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

292
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,750
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have flexibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

293
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,980
it later then it's probably worth

294
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,990
considering if that's if we're

295
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,220
attempting to to tie the tie the

296
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,330
integrity all the way down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

297
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,040
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than tying it to a</font>

298
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,900
reference but is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then you know</font>

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">notnot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome resource protected yeah</font>

300
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">and let's let's revisit that short</font>

301
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,260
action with what ocsp might be for a

302
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,970
protocol that helps us with this versus

303
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,950
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a junior of web service you</font>

304
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">could remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this information things</font>

305
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,430
like is this telephone number under the

306
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,140
scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ocn is actually</font>

307
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of services</font>

308
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your own trust</font>

309
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,020
relationship can provide to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you whereas</font>

310
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,790
again ocsp has a slightly different

311
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,880
because is now you're trusting<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah okay</font>

312
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,959
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go into today okay yeah word and</font>

313
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,960
you can tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we get it right yeah</font>

314
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:57,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the first approach goes through</font>

315
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,350
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> verifiers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> felidae calls when the</font>

316
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,600
cert only identifies the carrier or has

317
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,270
a surrogate ID like anos en hora spit

318
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,790
now the very simple and extremely

319
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:10,400
deployable way to do this is if we have

320
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,199
major networks that have bilateral trust

321
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,050
relationships that are doing these

322
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,760
signings I i if i may just pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> out two</font>

323
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,609
friends of mine in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see dolly</font>

324
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i suppose when maybe like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 in</font>

325
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,250
ask of established this bilateral

326
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:23,990
business relationship and<font color="#CCCCCC"> trust</font>

327
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,790
relationship and they agree they're just

328
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,560
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust numbers that are signed</font>

329
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,810
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font>

330
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,579
consumer show them even that might grow

331
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,079
that to a certain size that is based on

332
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,510
those kinds of bilateral trust

333
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:37,579
relationships and that is the simplest

334
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,130
way to do this because you just get to

335
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:41,839
use the search that tell you comcast net

336
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:43,459
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and if you</font>

337
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,190
trust comcast does not then you trust

338
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,810
resigning it on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of it the</font>

339
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,279
advantage is very deployable the

340
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,760
disadvantages it's not very inclusive

341
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,100
and the inclusivity of this is I think

342
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,750
the part of it that we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

343
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,070
when we talk about the possibility of

344
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,170
having some kind of an external<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

345
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,240
but Richard you seem to speak those

346
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,740
words all of inclusivity like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

347
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,510
there's a scalability issue here as well

348
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,640
there is also a scalability issue

349
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,380
ultimately given it there are of stay in

350
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the United</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,000 local</font>

351
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,060
exchange carriers there are I think it's

352
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,640
ninety-five percent of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers are</font>

353
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,290
done by the top 12 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something I don't</font>

354
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,240
know the north on my habits it's like

355
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,760
it's quite a bit there's very long tail

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:29,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so Martin dolly I I think you could</font>

357
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,399
start out with uh with something like

358
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,459
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the long pole in the</font>

359
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,100
tent on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

360
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,969
hasn't been addressed yet is what's

361
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:44,360
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> displayed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the end user um</font>

362
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,730
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at this from a</font>

363
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,660
deployment perspective you know stage

364
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:55,040
deployments you know getting you know

365
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:58,969
the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> 78 to deploy the signing first</font>

366
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:04,339
and exchanging it this way while working

367
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:07,370
on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respect to the you know</font>

368
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:11,119
exchanging of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the serfs and whatnot you</font>

369
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:13,719
know to detect that I mean do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

370
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:19,119
that capability in at a later date on

371
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:23,089
which then coincides with the delivery

372
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,979
to the end user in some consistent

373
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:27,770
manner which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the scope of</font>

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work dad that this has been</font>

375
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:34,879
verified so on so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is a</font>

376
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,530
workable yell deployment type scenario i

377
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,910
said i have a migration path slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

378
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,300
think will make you very happy that you

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,650
will see and not ten minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

380
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,990
that but it's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very clear</font>

381
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,030
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> x component of this we are not</font>

382
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,520
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business of the ITF of telling</font>

you as an operator who you trust or wat

384
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,000
right and nor are we in the business of

Christmas night<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand there are</font>

387
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,280
some other bodies that are studying the

388
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,840
CX problem I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested in seeing</font>

389
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> done in the standard way that will</font>

390
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,800
be clear about what what level of

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,020
assurance and so on is being provided by

392
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I would be happy to provide any</font>

any input or support any hooks that are

394
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,570

395
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,740
right for them but I it is incumbent I

396
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,330
think on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are doing that</font>

397
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,500
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work let us know if there's</font>

anything we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do differently to</font>

399
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,010
get there here because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

400
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,580
to be that selfie results yes Chris

401
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:26,390
sorry Chris when I was just gonna point

402
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,530
out I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping this is more simplistic</font>

403
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:32,860
than what the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach is purely</font>

404
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,899
based on trust I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping that there's</font>

405
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,560
certificate infrastructure there that we

406
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,060
can rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on cryptographic dress not just</font>

407
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,060
are you implying here like we just

408
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,730
self-signed certificates and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATT trust</font>

409
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:48,530
Comcast's there that's implying you have

410
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,910
your normal web search for comcast net

411
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,160
and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not to sign this</font>

412
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,780
yeah so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if the first approach</font>

413
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,250
is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole notion that what</font>

414
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,720
you're a testing and the certificate the

415
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:59,480
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust the certificate is</font>

416
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,160
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> who who that entity is right</font>

417
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,780
and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you expressly that in</font>

418
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">India is we have a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> options but</font>

419
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,860
the simplest of those is just to take

420
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,030
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> credential is used today to us</font>

421
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:12,409
you know to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> test that you are</font>

422
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:14,000
comcast.net and to use those<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay our</font>

423
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,030
assumption is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font>

424

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,910
signature of their certificates and

426
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,830
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than just trust there I</font>

427
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,210
guess what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying yeah but let me</font>

428
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you like me to do that for you</font>

429
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,670
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't make this decision here in</font>

430
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,320
the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> right about about what what does</font>

431
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,210
yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pointing out what the goal</font>

432
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,330
is I mean there's the practical thing of

433
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,870
you know when is that available and what

434
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,230
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know chick chick sorry chicken</font>

435
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,879
or egg scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

436
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,850
where one is available than the other

437
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,130
but I mean the big thing to work on is

438
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,189
getting the protocol in place and end

439
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,049
end calls happening and we do but I get

440
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,660
certificates become before that then we

441
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:00,190
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something more complex if I think</font>

442
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,559
it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we document though</font>

443
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,630
what we think the range of possible

444
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,160
certificate usages are what we think is

445
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:07,210
a transitional strategy that's getting

446
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,270
us towards where you want to go and

447
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:11,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're one end as we do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and yes what</font>

448
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looks like I think it look</font>

449
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much look like what you just</font>

450
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:19,149
described um Chris um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Richard</font>

451
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,730
both I know you like to speak softly but

452
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,650
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way this microphone is working</font>

453
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,900
please go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and project go into</font>

454
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,360
public speaking voice mode yeah it is

455
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:31,450
like really hard for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to hear you I'm</font>

456
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,590
so farm dunno cat but yes one thing when

457
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,010
I stressed about this approach is that

458
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,409
any time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a carrier who perhaps</font>

459
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:40,629
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of those bilateral trust</font>

460
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:42,100
relationships one<font color="#CCCCCC"> alternative that I</font>

461
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,780
would put on the table immediately is

462
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some kind of Oracle could</font>

463
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,379
probably help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this if they have</font>

464
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,299
an identifier like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an OC n or a spin</font>

465
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,610
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be thrown out to</font>

466
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:54,160
an external data service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> inquire it</font>

467
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok I don't know much about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this person</font>

468
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it likely that this number that has</font>

469
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,640
follows from you know is actually under

470
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,689
their authority and there are a bunch of

471
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,190
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that you could do that</font>

472
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,720
this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be a golden root</font>

473
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,390
this casino this couldn't be done I

474
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,370
think a variety of competing services

475
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,990
could provide this as a function or the

476
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,010
certificate itself if the ca was

477
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,650
structured that way could bless

478
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,470
particular one that was trusted for your

479
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and I don't think we're gonna</font>

480
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,010
make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about which of those is</font>

481
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,320
right what we're going to do again is

482
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,500
provide protocol machinery here that is

483
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,760
going to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> those options and so as</font>

484
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment</font>

485
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,230
environment we'll see what works we'll

486
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,000
see what's useful I'd rather kind of get

487
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,270
all the moving pieces I think we might

488
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,130
need specified now and then we'll see

489
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,900
what gets used and we can then<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair this</font>

490
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,000
down and then the work that's being done

491
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,559
in addison elsewhere can really once we

492
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,660
get this into the test fads once we get

493
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,970
this into operational production can

494
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:54,100
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a lot more about what worked and</font>

495
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:55,210
what didn't next please so right the

496
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
second approach and this is the approach

497
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">that originally the stuarts draft was</font>

498
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,129
most

499
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:02,049
Gaston is this notion that a verifier

500
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,490
validates a call when the authority over

501
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:05,889
numbers is actually built into the cert

502
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,350
itself the purpose of having a sir is

503
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,940
for the cert to tell ya what numbers are

504
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,370
in its scope there are a bunch of

505
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">different ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this you know the</font>

506
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,020
most obvious them would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like there is</font>

507
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,760
this TN off list certificate extension

508
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,059
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> specified now and the stirrups</font>

509
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,309
document if it has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in it</font>

510
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:26,559
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that one number to the</font>

511
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:28,809
one number that was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> called in the</font>

512
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,879
from header field wizard any hitter they

513
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:33,879
don't match then you have a verification

514
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,740
problem you know it's dead simple that

515
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,799
is the advantage there's no rtts there's

516
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:41,110
no messing around the enormous

517
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,540
disadvantage of this however is that

518
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,270
some kind of a new CI system is needed

519
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to provide these certs and dealing with</font>

520
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">large heterogeneous block numbers is</font>

521
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,750
extremely problematic because of working

522
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,790
and cooling and all the other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

523
00:22:52,750 --> 00:23:00,580
know so well in the numbering space mr.

527
00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,850
says please second approach simply will

528
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,610
not work in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. numbers are</font>

529
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:18,580
regularly and for good reasons listed as

530
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:22,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the caller ID that do not have anything</font>

531
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,949
to do with the carrier so a legitimate

532
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,970
call under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second approach will be</font>

533
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">rejected approach to is DOA at least in</font>

534
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">North America and probably in most</font>

535
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,200
jurisdictions the issue also kills the

536
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,629
Oracle function John mentioned related

537
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,650
to the first approach the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most we can do</font>

538
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,419
is trust the vouching carrier i will

539
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:51,100
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> pause a note that somebody left an</font>

541
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,230
that's a very very strong assertion and

542
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think i would need too much better</font>

543
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,400
understand the motivation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

544
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,659
assertion because it's simply not my

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding that that that is the</font>

546
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:08,380
situation there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no regular that is</font>

true mr. Berger<font color="#CCCCCC"> then like I message is</font>

548
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,940
illegal obviously so we

549
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,350
you care to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain why why why we're</font>

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">not arresting tim cook for that long</font>

551
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:25,389
upper offenses at this point we're gonna

552
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:29,590
use the red button is audio editor there

553
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:32,380
we are hi there so the reason it's like

554
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:36,149
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a legitimate call center</font>

555
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,300
you're doing outbound calls for a client

556
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:43,090
the number you have in there is there

557
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,450
CenturyLink number your number is served

this whole like delegation thing that's

570
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,250
built into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> too right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that you</font>

571
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:27,000
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> delegate that way and it's been like</font>

572
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,260
a huge part of this from the start write

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,850
it that solves everything that you just

574
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,690
add and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we've been discussing like</font>

575
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:40,449
three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so and as this was part</font>

576
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:42,429
of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right it's problem we set out</font>

577
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to solve we've got an RFC that says we</font>

578
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:46,540
are solving that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I believe that</font>

579
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,730
that the second approach does have

580
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,559
mechanics to deal with that delegation I

581
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,720
mean trick they're like yeah we have a

582
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,610
rat model document the primal I've been

583
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,650
very explicit I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know I have</font>

584
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,928
the slide in and this one there's a

585
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text it says that what</font>

586
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,350
we were going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve in this</font>

587
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,980
group is a way to ascertain whether or

588
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,419
not the signature for these calls has

589
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,250
the authority design for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

number or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the suggestion that this</font>

591
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,640
is like illegal or something and every

00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:16,510
use of hell of you or impossible to

593
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:21,429
realize is absolutely preposterous it's

594
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:22,900
just I mean it sets end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the list what</font>

595
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,250
you think the laws is that I will be

00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,960
jailed for

597
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,340
Eric maybe you can clarify<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

598
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,960
you were asserting that it would be

599
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,290
illegal I think you were asserting that

600
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,030
it would it would not assert the

601
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,540
identity of the number that had been

602
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,399
delegated to the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and that</font>

603
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,010
you were making<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technical objection</font>

604
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,750
not a legal framework would prevent it

605
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,370
from being used it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the regulatory</font>

606
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">framework representative from being used</font>

607
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,250
was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said the first time then</font>

608
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you said a bunch of very different</font>

609
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:55,660
things the second time but so it's

610

00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was what I took from Eric's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that it would you know this is a I wish</font>

oh sure here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

623
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,310
tighter conversation about this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

624
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,980
when i got up at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone in your</font>

625
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,840
your lurk cloth there and said you know

626
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,850
I have this working group called stir

627
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,530
and they're like from you know visiting

628
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:31,629
networks and home networks and I can

629
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,399
like totally imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> ki proxying systems</font>

630
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,880
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know I mean I was</font>

631
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,590
being facetious<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like if that's the</font>

632
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,140
if you want to point to like ims

633
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,030
architectures and say that those are the

634
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,190
things that make this problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

635
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:47,379
there are ways to address secure

636
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,080
delegations cure redirection and even

637
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,400
work like approaches to that so six it

638
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,470
to suggest it's like technically

639
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,320
impossible or that it's like you know

640
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,110
against regulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

641
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:06,399
unless if it's not fun show me why it's

642
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">not Chris one so the middle ground I</font>

643
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,120
like to play here is that we do need

644
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,420
some mechanism to protect law

645
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,419
enforcement IRS school district those

646
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:23,440
types of numbers we should look to this

647
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,750
as a way forward for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then see</font>

648
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,910
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go from there so there are</font>

649
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:30,310
specific use cases for which this seems

650
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">like having that specific number</font>

651
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:35,409
attestation actually kind of useful it's

652
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,270
not ever use case and it may be not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

653
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,050
the main like carrier signing use cases

654
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,639
that are

655
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:41,710
motivating the considerations not us

656
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,170
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but precisely things here that</font>

657
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,180
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about if if so much of</font>

658
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,600
impersonation say around this time of

659
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,790
year comes from specific spoofed numbers

660
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,649
that are associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS for</font>

example in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

662
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,850
seasonal problem that comes up around

tax season<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is responsible for a lot</font>

664

scams tactically protecting particular

665
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:07,780
sets of numbers may turn out to be quite

666
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,890
meaningful for solutions like this that

667
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">go do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have something more to say</font>

668
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:15,130
about that I'm so far ahead around the

669
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with the protecting the numbers</font>

670
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:25,510
um but um so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously any</font>

671
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:29,050
situation where you get the cert and

672
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:34,900
then you do the fetch as less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal</font>

673
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:38,830
privacy properties um so it baby we can

674
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,110
make it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real binary simple</font>

675
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,480
you know is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number within the scope</font>

of authority for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> circus or not which</font>

677
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is better than other things we talked</font>

678
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:51,159
about for this right so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> start better</font>

679
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,820
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one then don't be the entire list</font>

680
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:58,810
of numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are associated sir well</font>

681
00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:00,220
yes well well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's better yes and no</font>

682
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:01,540
it's better for the person making the

call towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person receiving the</font>

684
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:13,620
call um yes um so I guess I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

685
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get back to understanding on the</font>

686
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:19,529
for for the particular design we're

687
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,710
looking at here in terms of their silly

688
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:25,710
our designs which would allow you to

689
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:29,100
attest to on which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are allow you to have</font>

a small certificate on only<font color="#CCCCCC"> reveal one</font>

691
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:34,860
of the entries in it and yet not require

692
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,928
database dip right so for instance Adam

693
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,240
Berkel hash tree with bit commitments

694
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:41,580
for the for the values so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

695
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,509
I Gilzean understand all yes that's what

696
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,869
were the constraints that were trying to

697
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:47,309
outdo eyes for I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're when</font>

698
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:48,720
people start getting terrified about the

699
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,389
direction of history search draft was

700
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,749
when Barnes you may need to go back to

701
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:56,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dunce position in the bathroom again</font>

702
00:30:53,749 --> 00:30:59,129
when we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about stapley right</font>

703
00:30:56,369 --> 00:31:00,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean if you're gonna do those ESP like</font>

704
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,699
you could do stapling which obviously

705
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,320
does invert that yes privacy

706
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,210
consideration and I can imagine doing a

707
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,158
set better that is a staple that's right

708
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:13,019
sure sure it did you think that

709
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,509
techniques like that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> essence that</font>

710
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,460
seems viable I mean I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> I that</font>

711
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:22,230
generally is not occur to me how OCSP

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:25,649
stapling is on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> be stapling looks a</font>

713
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:30,539
lot like short shorts right um right and

714
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:32,639
so I mean um on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean and the bottom</font>

715
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,408
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you need to that in fact in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

716
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,549
particular case if I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it OCSP</font>

717
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:37,320
stapling response i might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well have</font>

718
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:41,999
the cert and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so and so the</font>

719
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,580
the typical reason to have I mean the

720
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:47,669
typical reason to have the matter honey

I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so I think I mean I think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a given if you're given assert</font>

that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a testimonial for a large</font>

724
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,129

725
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,080
read and then it says please call here

726
00:31:56,129 --> 00:32:02,158
to find out which it is particularly

727
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate is valid like um then and</font>

728
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,659
you say invert that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say well the</font>

729
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:09,179
ocsp response would have gotten um is

730
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,799
the one that it basically is a

731
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,659
testimonial for a single entry in the

732
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,009
block and it's attached to the cert you

733
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:16,289
couldn't suspense with a cert and has

734
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:18,090
invested with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> search and had and had</font>

735
00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:19,408
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only Oct civil response or a</font>

736
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,908
shortlist for the corresponding sees

737
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,859
double response are very interested and

738
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:27,210
making sure we have an optimization that

739
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:28,230
will preserve the privacy properties

740
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:30,240
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have not</font>

741
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:32,760
right it would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turtle asserts is</font>

742
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,370
more viable option Scott's Franklin GSP

743
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,440
I I think we can get away with saying

744
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,049
we're punting on that to get this

745
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,750
initial thing out the door to help get

746
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:44,280
us on the migration path like another

747
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,870
thing I saying if you see something you

748
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,970
think we're saying here that is going to

749
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,559
prevent us from going down shortly

750
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,600
search for example as a path we should

751
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:57,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">find that and no i I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I</font>

752
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,500
guess this this is this is a very

753
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,210
flexible mechanism you designed with a

754
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,490
lot of possible options and I guess I'm

755
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:04,770
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out is are all those</font>

756
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,480
options useful or could be cover the use

757
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,650
cases a<font color="#CCCCCC"> small set options I don't I</font>

758
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,660
don't disagree with you I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

759
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:12,450
this would certainly enable us to do is

760
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:15,419
definitely voz usual asserts on it would

761
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,280
not enable us I believe to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

762
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:19,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable us to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something like hash hash</font>

763
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,879
trees where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you know where you</font>

764
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,820
subsequently revealed pieces of it

765
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,049
unless you I mean misery here's like

766
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,250
actually a concrete example of line you

767
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,770
can imagine with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash street right you</font>

768
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:33,120
say like basically on you know I give

769
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:35,400
you a I of it I the big I um I have a

770
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,600
sign I<font color="#E5E5E5"> even assigned a huge block and i</font>

771
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,130
get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i get essentially covers that</font>

772
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,750
entire block and as a signature on the

773
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,520
root of the hash tree and then I know

774
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,799
all my all my entries and then I give

775
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you as an entity because you got one</font>

776
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:47,940
you're allowed one phone number is I

777
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:50,010
give you a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my search plus the</font>

778
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:51,299
chain of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash tree for only you and</font>

779
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,160
then you can attach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this one entity</font>

780
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:54,540
but but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do a delegation</font>

781
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,720
down to you and I also don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

782
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,250
on on second you this wouldn't support

783
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,100
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you need a new a new data</font>

784
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,419
structure on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think if if we</font>

785
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,040
think search or enough then probably

786
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,020
it's fine if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the use case</font>

787
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,730
requires something more sophisticated

788
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:10,230
then on them perhaps we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not quite</font>

789
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:17,520
there yet but he actually this would

790
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:18,139
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> troll the search Chris when</font>

791
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,969
I

792
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,739
think this is less<font color="#CCCCCC"> about arguing about</font>

793
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:24,139
whether the technology is appropriate

794
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:28,609
it's more it's more about sorry and get

795
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:33,049
right in there it's more about how do we

796
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:35,150
get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> A to B and a lot of the thought</font>

797
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,010
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been you know making sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

798
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,860
verification services support both

799
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,770
approaches as much as possible from the

800
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,170
beginning so as the infrastructure

801
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,810
evolves you know we can move from A to B

802
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:50,690
but we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure we don't break</font>

803
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,270
things in between and we're really

804
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,710
flexible attackers playing exactly what

805
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,820
the verification service chooses to do

806
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,740
with these certs and we get to the

807
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,450
migration path which i think is like the

808
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,720
next slide after this then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

809
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:04,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about them so i just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

810
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,430
correct one thing on this slide on the

811
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,460
disadvantage and the first sub bullet

812
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:12,560
says knew that a new CA is needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

813
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,750
these are done with a meaningful subject

814
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,000
and some extension that encodes the

815
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:18,980
numbers your allocated that's perfectly

816
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,720
compatible with using existing web<font color="#CCCCCC"> bki</font>

817
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,790
certs it's just a different extension in

818
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,850
CA puts in yeah it's more of a question

819
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,370
of what the enrollment it's the CSP it's

820
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually like what CPS actually I think</font>

821
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">as they don't have for this to get</font>

822
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,400
enrollment you need for sure but I mean

823
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:36,110
ca's change their CPS is to admit new

824
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,690
extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> emit new extensions all the time</font>

825
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,910
it's a pretty low lift I yeah I've just

826
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,230
again reserves weekend for instance for

827
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:44,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prince's we just added the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stable</font>

828
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,370
extension we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fairly broadly</font>

829
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,320
used without a major revamp of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font>

830
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:56,779
yeah in York

831
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:58,940
eric berger first just note that he was

832
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:04,130
not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about law or regulation</font>

833
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:06,320
previously his comment is um that it's

834
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:08,420
worth noting the delegation mechanism in

835
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft which is in Section four point</font>

836
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,730
oh is is TBD there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one section saying</font>

837
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">there might be delegation and in there</font>

838
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,500
in 40 and then there's two parts to it

839
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:22,760
that our TBD saying future versions of

840
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:25,010
spec<font color="#E5E5E5"> may do this his suggestions is how</font>

841
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,020
about a concrete proposal break the

842
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,460
draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two or more certificate</font>

843
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,509
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> why bundle them together</font>

844
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:36,230
approach one works today approach to may

845
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:38,360
work if and when fleshed out and he also

846
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,130
says I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to tell the FCC we are</font>

847
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,620
late with stir because we are working on

848
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:45,440
an approach that may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used I don't</font>

849
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,819
want to tell the SEC that we are you

850
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,490
know delivering something that doesn't

851
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,260
actually solve their problem and

852
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:53,029
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't actually solve</font>

853
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,240
what's in the problem statement that you

854
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">can figure out how to get weather for</font>

855
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,200
the subject if the number is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

856
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:04,750
scope of it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not is what we said</font>

857
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:07,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">result and I understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know I</font>

858
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:10,280
again we gotta like next slide I think

859
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,500
it's next slide the migration<font color="#CCCCCC"> path</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

860
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,940
this next one after this you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

861
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,970
straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> two that one yeah go straight</font>

862
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,680
two that one actually um you know I mean

863
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,890
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this a lot like I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I look</font>

864
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,080
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> howdy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim got started right i mean</font>

865
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,540
what i want to see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of large</font>

866
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,870
providers we're willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start signing</font>

867
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:33,680
these things in this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach way</font>

868
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:35,960
right and that you know because with

869
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,240
deacon when Google and Yahoo and

870
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,800
whatever the set of other you know

871
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,109
initial proponents were did it like

872
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,930
suddenly like forty percent of email was

873
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,850
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deacon signed and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was just</font>

874
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,190
very useful to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this off the ground</font>

875
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because let's face it a lot of mail goes</font>

876
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,490
comes from gmail and comes from yahoo

877
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:54,350
and things like that very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> casey</font>

878
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,450
or a lot of mail comes from AT&T comes

879
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:58,430
from comcast and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a lot of people</font>

880
00:37:56,450 --> 00:38:01,189
will trust the recitations because

881
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:04,279
that's where it came from good and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

882
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,790
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can stand up these support services</font>

883
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,030
right

884
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,800
and the certificates can either again

885
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,360
through through a variety of approaches

886
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,730
we've discussed have surrogate

887
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,160
identifiers they will then query some

888
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:18,770
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oracle's that could</font>

889
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,480
again I may not even be connected to the

890
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,190
certificate authority in any way to

891
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,440
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions like is this number</font>

892
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,820
under this fit right it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that</font>

893
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,930
there are independent is you trust your

894
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,240
own reasons you could have your own

895
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:31,339
offline database right sitting right

896
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,919
there and next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your verifier that has</font>

897
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,060
big maps of that for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're one</font>

898
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,200
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the larger providers that's not at</font>

899
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:41,990
all an implausible scenario and so you

900
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,810
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i I'd like to think that we're</font>

901
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:48,200
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be late if we are providing</font>

902
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a migration path that shows here's how</font>

903
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,500
you start here's some directions that we

904
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:55,700
can show going forward from here what I

905
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,610
don't want to do that was end up in a

906
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,589
situation where verifiers implement one

907
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,720
little subset of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that only works</font>

908
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,860
for the first step in this because what

909
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,990
that will lead to is a not very

910
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,850
inclusive environment going forward wear

911
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,589
something completely new and different

912
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:11,810
will have to be done to support anybody

913
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,160
other than that gang of eight or

914
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,110
whatever it is from participating I

915
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,549
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is unacceptable as a as a</font>

916
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,080
migration story and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why they</font>

917
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,780
start my argument has been that we need

918
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">these to be in the same draft so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

919
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,760
recap but I think you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said they</font>

920
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:27,740
taught me in like you know training so

921
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,660
you're saying initially we're gonna

922
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,729
situation where basically I look at this

923
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and go this is e TMT I don't care the</font>

924
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,330
number is this is totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> carmela right</font>

925
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,970
and then but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't but you will</font>

926
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:40,940
like thee but you'd like that the system

927
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:43,480
to implement arm validation mechanisms

928
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,190
which could support a more rich set of

929
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,950
delegation procedures so that when we

930
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't we have some others 80 I can</font>

931
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,520
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh this appears to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be from you</font>

932
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,410
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> podunk city and the phone</font>

933
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,700
company and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> city</font>

934
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,140
foam blocks it was cool but if it were

935
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,509
some 800 of person where else it would

936
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,490
not be cool is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that correct yes I can</font>

937
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">believe in that story and again I I</font>

938
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:06,979
don't think it's gonna delay this going

939
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,750
forward to do this and in fact I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

940
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,580
it's essential that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

941
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,950
this and if we're going to say with a

942
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,860
straight face that resolving the problem

943
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,919
okay so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm martin dolly ah i mean i</font>

944
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,230
think the

945
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,930
approach you know particularly if you

946
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:25,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some representation like an OC n in</font>

947
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:28,529
the sir can go beyond the gang of seven

948
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:31,470
eight it can but and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also and I agree</font>

949
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">with Chris as well that um there are use</font>

950
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,359
cases where the second approach is also

951
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:40,380
very useful so I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

952
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:44,130
supporting both you know and recognizing

953
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:48,240
a migratory path is is a good is good

954
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,680
pragmatically and um I think King we can

955
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,459
get consensus around that which is

956
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably more important yeah I hope we</font>

957
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:00,480
can get consensus around that mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berger</font>

958
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">dan York channeling eric eric says so if</font>

959
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,140
the approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to put out something</font>

960
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:06,210
that works for 90-plus percent of

961
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,330
traffic and then with experience will

962
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:10,980
work for everybody why toss out

963
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,710
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may learn from</font>

964
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,430
experience may or may not work we might

965
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:20,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">even learn the right right way to do it</font>

966
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:23,100
so an argument at me before they'll make

967
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:24,840
again now is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gang of eight</font>

968
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:27,480
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hope to seed adoption for</font>

969
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,100
this where the source of the calls that

970
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:33,150
are problematic that we're actually

971
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,560
being asked to address then you know it

972
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,120
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great solution to the robo</font>

973
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,730
calling and voicemail hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in every</font>

974
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,279
everything else problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just get</font>

975
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:43,680
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it however as we know it's</font>

976
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,240
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily at least in the</font>

977
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,609
United States a number of much smaller

978
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,910
entities right that are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of</font>

979
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,950
this the problematic calls as a

980
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:55,859
consequence again I look at it much more

981
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:58,620
like it is you know seating adoption

982
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,810
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> major providers gives us that</font>

983
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,359
bootstrap gives us that implementation

984
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,759
base and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll handle some of the</font>

985
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,810
problematic cases right but it's it's

986
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a lot of these these</font>

987
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:10,049
unfortunately I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> these smaller</font>

988
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:11,400
providers that if you don't have a story

989
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to how to get them into this they're</font>

990
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually with the problem is coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

991
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:19,530
right so it didn't work speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

992
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,650
own hat it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as I sit and</font>

993
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and made this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess it</font>

994
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,840
sounds like you and Eric are in violent

995
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,828
agreement on one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things which is</font>

996
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">that approach to the one</font>

997
00:42:29,829 --> 00:42:36,219
should be deployed sooner rather than

998
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:37,629
later it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm offering that</font>

999
00:42:36,219 --> 00:42:39,369
the ITF is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cause this</font>

1000
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,749
migration path to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this</font>

1001
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:42,069
migration happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a part of a</font>

1002
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:43,749
standard we're going to produce this

1003
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:45,700
vibration path is a vision for how the

1004
00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:48,249
components the protocol mechanisms were

1005
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,288
discussing could be deployed and make a

1006
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world what we propose</font>

1007
00:42:50,289 --> 00:42:53,709
to do again is to board a standard that

1008
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to contain the necessary</font>

1009
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:58,239
machinery to create this migration path

1010
00:42:56,049 --> 00:43:00,009
in the industry so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could the</font>

1011
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,660
summary I see then is that you both

1012
00:43:00,009 --> 00:43:03,339
agree that the first approach could work

1013
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:05,859
the difference is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric wants to</font>

1014
00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,869
stop with with approach one or just get

1015
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:10,029
that out there and ship it basically get

1016
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,559
that started whereas you want to ship

1017
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:13,509
something that includes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

1018
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,339
but also includes another approach that

1019
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:17,319
could be used by others<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the very</font>

1020
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:18,819
specific reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just sure don't</font>

1021
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:21,130
believe it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

1022
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:23,709
that community of good doers that are

1023
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,539
responsible the actual problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

1024
00:43:23,709 --> 00:43:28,209
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I think just shipping</font>

1025
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:30,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't actually address the</font>

1026
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:33,879
problem and eric has just said in there

1027
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:36,609
yes I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop with approach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 now</font>

1028
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,880
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn more before doing approach</font>

1029
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:42,848
to the important point is for now not

1030
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,369
forever so he's of the approach of ship

1031
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:47,140
it now get it out do this see what it

1032
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:51,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">does and then figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out if approach to</font>

1033
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,538
is needed that<font color="#CCCCCC"> affair I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1034
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,949
think you're barely characterizing what

1035
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:55,900
he says and yes I fundamentally disagree

1036
00:43:53,949 --> 00:44:00,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that would be I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

1037
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:04,529
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake Chris when I I don't want to</font>

1038
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:04,529
extend things too much further but I

1039
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,530
you haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything or advocated</font>

1040
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,799
for anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't allow the</font>

1041
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:15,110
smaller carriers or the pink carriers or

1042
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,820
whoever to get a certificate I mean

1043
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:20,360
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys that will probably</font>

1044
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:24,260
resist this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most right it's it's in</font>

1045
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:29,030
our paper to have less you know spam on

1046
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:30,710
our voice networks so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure why</font>

1047
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,390
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up gang of eight or</font>

1048
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:35,600
anything like that other than the fact

1049
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:38,839
that maybe we can push this forward that

1050
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,520
is the point yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I dress I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

1051
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:46,190
have that positive perspective rather

1052
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:48,860
than the Lord's work<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there now</font>

1053
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:52,340
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you appreciate not trying to say</font>

1054
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:53,810
otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> I um at moments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this it</font>

1055
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,670
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes be useful to consult our</font>

working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter and we're deciding</font>

1057
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:03,140
whether or not we're heading in the

1058
00:44:56,810 --> 00:45:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> direction yeah so so I'm looking</font>

1059
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter here it says we will</font>

1060
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,359
develop a solution a mechanism for

1061
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:09,860
verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the originator of a</font>

1062
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:13,990
sip session is authorized to use the

1063
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:17,630
claim source telephone number and as

1064
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,759
that reads to me you know a mechanism

1065
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:22,970
one here<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't meet the mail for</font>

1066
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,530
that if you're verifying the summit nan

1067
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,939
telephone number identity of the

1068
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,550
originator that's great that can be used

1069
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:30,140
with some out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of band stuff to verify</font>

1070
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:31,820
the telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number authorization</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1071
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,009
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a solution to verify the</font>

1072
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:35,870
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1073
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,190
can call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works working ribs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1074
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:38,660
complete we need something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

1075
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:40,970
solves the remainder of that problem so

1076
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:44,330
yes we can do one as a bridging step but

1077
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:45,560
we ultimately need to get to I just

1078
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't see the point in cracking the</font>

1079
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,100
simple like two deliverables I don't is

1080
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,320
that all that will do is encourage

1081
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:53,180
people to do the thing that isn't going

1082
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help well it helped right help seed</font>

1083
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,540
adoption it helps get some signatures

1084
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,580
right it does let's say it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

1085
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,170
at all but it will encourage people to

1086
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,360
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not sufficient to</font>

1087
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:06,500
actually address i think what our pork

1088
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:09,080
rep model is and and have it have an

1089
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,730
opportunity and an excuse to stop there

1090
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,360
in a place that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel as</font>

1091
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:17,720
insufficiently inclusive grass brush

<font color="#CCCCCC">housley speaking with no hat</font>

1093
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:24,410
approach one builds on widely available

1096
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,040
inclusion in that infrastructure of some

1097
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:37,550
new extensions and possibly like in the

1098
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,070
ocsp case for enhancements of some of

1099
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:42,590
the infrastructure services so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1100
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:45,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on those learn about</font>

1103
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,839
lessons that's fine but let's not wait

1104
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:55,400
and not to learn those lessons early I

1105
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,500
mean I I don't want to speak too much

1106
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:02,330
about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our implementation is like</font>

1107
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,760
we're building this stuff right so the

1108
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:09,220
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be built I promise eric berger</font>

1109
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:11,780
i do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with richard barnes and</font>

1110
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:21,560
if the threat model has pink carriers

1111
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:23,690
approach one works<font color="#CCCCCC"> well soon know me I</font>

1112
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:27,040
salamat let me try to explain why I

1113
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">think what he means by that insofar as</font>

1114
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,330
you know pink carriers are attempting to

1115
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:35,089
impersonate numbers that are used by

1116
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:37,339
gang of eight people provided there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1117
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:39,770
an expectation among the members of that

1118
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:41,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust domain that they're going to have</font>

1119
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,280
these signatures in there then yes that

1120
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,569
impersonator is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

1121
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,080
impersonate one of those gang of eight

1122
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:49,849
numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> however as we all know the</font>

1123
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,650
source of these impersonation things

1124
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,420
Henning Henning actually has a great

1125
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,450
graph of this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric</font>

1126
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:59,030
of what the rural Washington telcos are

00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:02,390
that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used as the primary you</font>

1129
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,310
I i think the optics of this are

1130
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:09,080
entirely different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think so for</font>

1131
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:11,599
like voicemail<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacking I agree the gang</font>

1132
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,180
of eight approach this isn't a bad one

1133
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,560
because it will prevent someone from be

1134
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,930
able impersonate you to call your own

1137
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,348
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

1138
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,599
again he agrees with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russ publish</font>

1139
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:32,349
approach one work on and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish</font>

1140
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:33,880
approach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are just in</font>

1141
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:35,740
back and forth mode between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1142
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,200
you now it would help me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a sense</font>

1143
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the room I can see faces but let's go</font>

1144
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and get a home so we can lay down</font>

1145
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:46,150
what the the current thinking in the

1146
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,460
room is if you think we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font>

1147
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,770
the path that<font color="#E5E5E5"> John is proposing what the</font>

1148
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:53,829
current document does after<font color="#CCCCCC"> its fleshed</font>

1149
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,450
out of specifying both of these

1150
00:48:53,829 --> 00:48:57,490
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time in our</font>

1151
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:59,890
initial release<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask you to hum in a</font>

1152
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:04,078
second the second home will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be split the</font>

1153
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">doc in to do one and then do the other I</font>

1154
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:14,348
have a channel from relay from King a

1155
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:17,440
car berg says could we push approach to

1156
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:19,599
to an appendix to get a current snapshot

1157
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:28,240
and continue to approach to in another

1158
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:30,160
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you let's start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1159
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the homes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I that I just proposed if</font>

1160
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,220
you think that we should go ahead and

1161
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:39,640
document finish out the documenting of

1162
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:41,649
both of these at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> hum now if you</font>

1163
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,960
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should split things out and</font>

1164
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:45,700
i'll put it either into the appendix or

1165
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:50,710
a separate document for the first time

1166
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">hum now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there were no hums in</font>

1167
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,000
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suspect there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be at</font>

1168
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,790
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hum to hums in jabber to homes</font>

1169
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,810
and jabber alright so we've got a pretty

1170
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:03,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong majority in the room that that we</font>

1171
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:05,890
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and run this thing out</font>

1172
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:09,099
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you that descent can you argue</font>

1173
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:11,410
your case on list but let's move on and

1174
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:12,819
please do i recommend again I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1175
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:14,200
to trivialize this right i mean we're

1176
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:15,910
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's practically</font>

1177
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,439
going to work you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as any of</font>

1178
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:18,819
us do what the constraints ours were

1179
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,260
operating under on this in terms of the

1180
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:25,000
timelines and in terms of what the

1181
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:27,280
actual problem is and I we've stayed

1182
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this for a long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I mean I think</font>

1183
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">we understand what the what what what is</font>

1184
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,259
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve what of the things that</font>

1185
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:34,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can do here</font>

1186
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:41,589
next we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes for me and 10</font>

1187
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:42,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes left in the meeting um yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1188
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:44,589
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this again this this</font>

1189
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:47,109
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a crucial part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

1190
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:49,569
we the ITF is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dictate</font>

1191
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:52,359
verify our policy and we acknowledge

1192
00:50:49,569 --> 00:50:54,009
that right and even if we supply

1193
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:56,078
additional information with the knee

1194
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:59,079
certs that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access some</font>

1195
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:01,809
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> off board external service you</font>

1196
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:05,170
know with that is not going to compel

1197
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:07,809
your verifier that you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating to</font>

1198
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,130
consult those services if your trust

1199
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:11,589
relationships tell you to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1200
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:13,630
else because of that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

1201
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:16,480
really hard time seeing what the harm is

1202
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,579
and specifying this protocol machinery

1203
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,680
and making this available because at the

1204
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,880
end of the day if what really people<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1205
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,078
one of you is just gang of eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1206
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,089
they can they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even need to invoke</font>

1207
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,339
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's like a couple extra</font>

1208
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:30,700
bytes in your cert and it's it's not

1209
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:36,400
even worth having this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conflict</font>

1210
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:37,779
over next so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this migration</font>

1211
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,190
path makes sense let's get out the

1212
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:41,410
thumbscrews<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there may be a little</font>

1213
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,349
more TBD ish stuff to do in there but

1214
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:45,940
this is a ton of lightning protocol work

1215
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:47,109
we gotta fix the algorithm stuff

1216
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,359
actually that's being talked about in

1217
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:51,880
the list today but we have delegated

1218
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,319
that responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> to certain</font>

1219
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,240
individuals that are participating in

1220
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">this process and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect we'll have</font>

1221
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">some new text or that very soon once we</font>

1222
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,529
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero for which I promise we'll</font>

1223
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:07,029
fill in those dvds on delegation this is

1224
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:10,450
not rocket science for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think we</font>

1225
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:12,730
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done right if the one thing</font>

1226
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd say is we do have a non ocsp service</font>

1227
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:17,680
like a web service that's something that

1228
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,390
converts OC ends to telephone number

1229
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,129
lists or lets you query<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bruno she had to</font>

1230
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:22,450
say with a health number as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their Eric</font>

1231
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:24,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be like totally new</font>

1232
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:26,680
work totally let's do that in another

1233
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:29,099
deliverable like because that would be

1234
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:32,470
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new web service redefining and</font>

1235
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:34,750
that i am happy to put somewhere else

1236
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,129
and say let's do that later I think

1237
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,950
we've got enough to do the basic

1238
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:40,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">building blocks in there today and let's</font>

1239
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:42,669
do that I have one more slide that

1240
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,569
actually isn't about that so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1241
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:48,640
go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean people roughly cool</font>

1242
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:52,538
here people feel like we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1243
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,430
understand what's going on should we be

1244
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:56,799
worrying more about the privacy model

1245
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,180
before we go forward and not excluding

1246
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,460
some of the options like a cur was

1247
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,710
describing I mean there is there any

1248
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,019
real discomfiture that that people have

1249
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:09,760
its approach if so this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great</font>

1250
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:13,649
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it no one's running</font>

1251
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:17,109
to the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I got one more slide</font>

1252
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:20,230
it's a plug there is this other working

1253
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:22,750
groups called modern and like we're

1254
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,089
trying to provide kind of the overall

1255
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,910
ecosystem for how numbering might

1256
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:30,250
function on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we could really</font>

1257
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">use some other people to come and talk</font>

1258
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:34,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us about it we want to get like a bit</font>

1259
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,400
more a place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

1260
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,019
consensus calls for this it's after this

1261
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,240
if unlike Martin<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollar you're not</font>

1262
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:41,740
getting a plane immediately be really

1263
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,890
great you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it to the modern</font>

1264
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:52,180
session next and talk to us about it

1265
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:55,629
that's all I have what's your current

1266
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:58,868
best guests for next set of Reds when

1267
00:53:55,630 --> 00:54:00,730
when she I expect to be finding finding

1268
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:03,910
thumbs to put in the screws yeah I mean

1269
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:05,170
given how how much interest there isn't

1270
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:06,700
this work and I think people you

1271
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,829
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much interest there is i</font>

1272
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:11,078
would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we already start</font>

1273
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:15,309
looking at scheduling an interim phone

1274
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:17,529
call you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for six to eight weeks out</font>

1275
00:54:15,309 --> 00:54:19,480
