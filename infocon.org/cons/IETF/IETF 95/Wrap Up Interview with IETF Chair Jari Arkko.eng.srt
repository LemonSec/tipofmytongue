00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">force</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or ITF in buenos aires argentina</font>

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,899

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,150
thousand people inside then hundreds

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,740
more online and this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

10
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,448
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting in Latin America and the</font>

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,459
second meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> south and hemisphere</font>

12
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,560
so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an important milestone as</font>

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,330
well because we do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach as many</font>

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,538
people in the wall as possible who are

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,009
working on internet technology and make

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,989
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we understand everybody's</font>

17
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,239
issues around the internet and Internet

18
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,160
technology now<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking working on</font>

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,890
technologies we also had a hackathon

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,179
here at on the weekend before can you

21
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,850
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about what happened</font>

22
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,620
there so the hackathon is an opportunity

23
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,270
for us to work on the code so code is

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,760
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually matters not the</font>

25
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,469
specification so much we do work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,089
specifications as well but we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

27
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,969
code in order to actually do these

28
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,850
things and the hackathon is an

29
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,289
opportunity for us to do this software

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">development that work with the open</font>

31
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,820
source community and we have a hundred

32
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,189
people in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> event this time it's a</font>

33
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,570
fairly good turnout and what's

34
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,360
interesting that we had written very

35
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,970
many newcomers in this event<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30</font>

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,189
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting to see everybody</font>

37
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,530
work together the newcomers and the

38
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,610
people who had more experience and we

39
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,830
also had<font color="#CCCCCC"> many new topics in this event</font>

40
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,829
so one team for instance programmed

41
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,750
version of TLS the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of our</font>

42
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups is working on a more</font>

43
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,040
secure version of the protocol

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,139
underneath HTTPS and and they got it

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,259
working during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weekend and deployed</font>

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">live in a network on the internet so I</font>

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:44,280
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing yeah it</font>

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,929
was cool i was there working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on some dns</font>

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,390
things and what i thought was neat too

50
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,640
is we had at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person may be the</font>

51
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,619
couple that came in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the programming</font>

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,140
side they were local developers who

53
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,299
found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the hackathon got here</font>

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,040
and got involved is great but moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

55
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,229
to the meeting itself what were<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,689
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> main technical themes that you saw</font>

57
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,579
throughout the week well we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

58
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,648
different working groups so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't</font>

59
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,660
answer on everything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on but</font>

60
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,459
some of the main topics that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF</font>

61
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,720
works on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance in the Internet of</font>

62
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,160
Things so so what

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,430
the topics<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked about that</font>

64
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this week was how can we make sure that</font>

65
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:23,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the applications are interoperable even</font>

66
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,410
if you have you know IP connectivity to

67
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,480
the various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices and use</font>

68
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,400
standardized protocols but how can your

69
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,739
applications be actually compatible so

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,420
they get light bulb polite<font color="#E5E5E5"> suites for</font>

71
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,460
instance from different vendors and so

72
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,230
we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that some of the other</font>

73
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">topics security of course already</font>

74
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,760
managed to this this work and TLS 1.3

75
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,049
which is hugely important to improve the

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,049
security of the web we also had two

77
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,730
discussions around the effects of

78
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,590
increased encryption on the internet

79
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,590
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is causing some pain on how to</font>

80
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">manage networks so we had one meeting</font>

81
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,320
around being able to deploy CDN networks

82
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,360
with encryption in a safe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

83
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,299
manner and other meeting about how to

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,470
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> priorities of encrypted traffic</font>

85
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,860
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what's</font>

86
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,750
actually inside the packets now it we're

87
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">done it's Friday people are leaving</font>

88
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,600
behind us we're all tired and going on

89
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,330
to what happens next so our next meeting

90
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,579
is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> july in berlin germany but of</font>

91
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,000
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF works all the time and</font>

92
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,100
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet naturally so that is</font>

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,780
where most of these discussions will not

94
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,859
continue so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>
