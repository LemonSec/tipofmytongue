yeah yeah Spencer was right actually I

126
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,939

127
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,240
much bigger anyway so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">Accord off and let me give you that</font>

129
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,470
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head sab that have</font>

130
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:50,540

131
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,250
this book was that basically operators

132
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,290
started seeing a lot of encrypted

133
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,900
traffic on the internet and in

134
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,370
particular on radio networks you know

135
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,310
the resource for that they are you know

136

139
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,810
that the encryption is used all the time

140
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,160
so the problem is like some of the

141
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,020
techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they used to do radio</font>

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,080
traffic so when the amount of traffic

146
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,930
that is encrypted is really high they

147
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,000
cannot use those techniques any longer

148
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:28,370
as a consequence actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsma which is</font>

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,120
the association of mobile operators they

150
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,160
they held that workshop with the IAB it

151
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,500
was called Manu<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically they were</font>

152
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,199
discussing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how to look at</font>

153
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

154
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,280
they were actually checking specifically

155
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,410
not just so much the architectures like

156
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,800
3d BP but more like what is actually

157
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployed on what is actually in use and</font>

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,729
and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would suggest that you go</font>

159
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">and read the report because they it were</font>

160
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,140
just coming up last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week I think and and</font>

161
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that will give you an idea of</font>

162
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,830
all these discussions those discussions

163
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,040
were basically no scope in a smaller

164
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,950
group because it was an IEP workshop and

165
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,140
this is an ITF both so the the scope is

166
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,580
much bigger um we're going to basically

167
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be continuing in those discussions</font>

168
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,340
and investigating basically what are

169
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,110
they the proposals and solutions that we

170
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:18,480
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use in order to address some of</font>

171
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,090
those problems so as I said we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

172
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,850
discussing your requirement pain points

173
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,130
and potential solutions this is a no

174
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,660
working group forming both so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

175
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,210
actually come up with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

176
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,640
could look like that solution as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

177
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">for example one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposals is to</font>

178
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,780
use diffserv for that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

179
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,880
come back to the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group or</font>

180
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,100
or if something new would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter but</font>

181
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will not be an accord working group</font>

182
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,210
basically working on on that type of

183
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,459
thing so it's more like you know more

184
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,160
let's say you know open any discussions

185
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,160
we want to explore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue and and see</font>

186
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,420
what it comes out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so having said</font>

187
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,920
that do you have any questions

188
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,740
suggestions yeah good point on Thursday

189
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,140
the Buffy's on Thursday um I forget

190
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">which lot I think it's in the morning</font>

191
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:16,560
actually anyway a look in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda a</font>

192
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">court I on Thursday morning session good</font>

193
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,050
morning ok so it's morning session um if

194
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:24,150
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to to basically go get familiar</font>

195
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,310
with that as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said repay my new report</font>

196
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,990
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> uploaded you know a lot of</font>

197
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,780
material they are you know presentations

198
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,880
life the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you just gon can go</font>

199
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:40,350
to the material<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and have a look at</font>

200
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:43,850
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you yeah see you</font>

201
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,850
can come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> front</font>

202
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,050
good afternoon my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Olivia we see</font>

203
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,610
and i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about something we</font>

204
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,410
call rekindling network products talk

205
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,019
innovation with user level<font color="#E5E5E5"> stacks so</font>

206
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,259
this is basically attempting to put

207
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,389
networks tax in user space and this is

208
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:49,290
work in conjunction with people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> NEC</font>

209
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:52,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">met up in budget looking so the</font>

210
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,519
motivation here is if we could extend

211
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:55,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">let your for functionality we could</font>

212
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,490
address a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems and there's a</font>

213
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,370
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people working on things like if</font>

214
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:00,899
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the windows I'll fast open and so</font>

215
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,819
forth there's also things like

216
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,510
encryption TCP crypt and so forth so

217
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:09,720
clearly there there is quite a need for

218
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:11,520
improving transport protocols but is it

219
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really possible to still deploy there</font>

220
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">for extensions we know there's a lot of</font>

221
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,490
middle boxes out there but we've done

222
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">some measurement studies and we show</font>

223
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:23,220
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-designed TCP extensions it</font>

224
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,959
is still possible to deploy these new

225
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,260
extensions over about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty-six percent</font>

226
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the paths so if the paths actually</font>

227
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,658
work how come we're not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy</font>

228
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:37,500
new transport layer so easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

229
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:41,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet so the actual implementations</font>

230
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,799
are in the OS stacks of course and this

231
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,059
is for many reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

232
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,668
provides isolation between applications

233
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:51,030
and then you provide socket<font color="#CCCCCC"> api's and</font>

234
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,970
then you have new OS versions that adopt

235
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,139
these new protocols and extensions a

236
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,809
part of the problem is though that the

237
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:02,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">OS is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the release cycle is pretty slow</font>

238
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:04,320
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the magnitude of years and once you</font>

239
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,429
have the supporting the osu actually

240
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,340
have installed that doesn't mean that

241
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:09,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're actually using it because</font>

242
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">defaults mean that certain features are</font>

243
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,970
not turned on and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they're</font>

244
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:17,129
there if many system admins are sort of

245
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">loathe to actually turn them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on because</font>

246
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,440
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fix something that isn't</font>

247
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,740
broken just improve performance of X so

248
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,450
I don't want to really

249
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,980
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the details of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph very</font>

250
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,890
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just give you the overview</font>

251
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:34,750
this is basically trace from Maui from

252
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:37,240
2007<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 2 2012 and what it's doing its</font>

253
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,040
measuring deployment amount of certainty

254
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,990
CP features such as selective

255
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,970
acknowledgements<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps and windows</font>

256
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,460
scales and the sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is for</font>

257
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:47,110
Windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Linux and some of these such</font>

258
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,600
as selective<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement in Windows</font>

259
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:53,199
was deployed in Windows 2000 and you can

260
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,550
see in the curse<font color="#CCCCCC"> that even in 2012 you</font>

261
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,410
don't have full deployment you have

262
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,510
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seventy five percent and</font>

263
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,880
some of the other features very slowly

264
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:06,460
ramp up over five six seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so</font>

265
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,100
what we're sort of aiming for is that to

266
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,230
ease upgrade we could move protocol

267
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,659
stacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into user space and of</font>

268
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:16,660
course it would also aid in

269
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:19,150
experimentation the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

270
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,710
no real practical way to do this we need

271
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,809
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

272
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,100
isolation between the applications we

273
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:26,050
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to support legacy</font>

274
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,879
applications on the system so we need to

275
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,960
still need to support the host OS stack

276
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,550
and we need high performance so what we

277
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,870
did is we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system that sort of</font>

278
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,879
provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little tease and sort of</font>

279
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,250
these this is the overall architecture

280
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,530
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk you through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font>

281
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:44,050
bottom to top so you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nic at the</font>

282
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,970
bottom and then we were based on the

283
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">software switch call tada which is the</font>

284
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,429
name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> API from the university of pisa</font>

285
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,070
and inside that<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch we have a module</font>

286
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that basically works on three tuples so</font>

287
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,300
networks tax and applications register

288
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,880
three tuples and then this module make

289
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,030
sure that packets are directed in the

290
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right stacks on RX and on</font>

291
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:09,820
TX<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it filters such that</font>

292
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:13,300
stacks don't send packets to from the

293
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,550
wrong three couple and then we add

294
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtual port to the switch those virtual</font>

295
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,970
courts are connected to the user level

296
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,220
networks tax and on top of that we have

297
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the actual applications the other</font>

298
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,910
thing to note is you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

299
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">right hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the diagram we still</font>

300
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,290
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oasis stack so it's still</font>

301
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,840
possible to have a user-level stack

302
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:34,930
alongside with the standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> colonel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> esta</font>

303
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,389
so

304
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,360
features of this are of course we

305
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,190
support multiple stacks we provide

306
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,129
namespace isolations through the

309
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,210
a minute and we run both on on freebsd

310
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:56,290
and linux and it's open source and i'll

311
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:58,240
give you think later on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to give</font>

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you some performance numbers the first</font>

313
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,880
thing we did is measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> just roll txt</font>

314
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:06,040
UDP packets what we have in this diagram

315
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,770
is the experimental setup so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> TX</font>

316
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the very top we implemented</font>

317
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,090
essentially it's it's not really a stack

318
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:14,770
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> GDP and on top of that we</font>

319
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,720
implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet generator right</font>

320
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,590
that's a sense packets as fast as

321
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,810
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that connects to a ring of</font>

322
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,970
packet connected to the switch and what

323
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,950
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is we can create multiple of</font>

324
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,960
these rings and these rings each can be

325
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">assigned to different cpu core so we can</font>

326
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">scale the performance of this with</font>

327
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:36,970
multiple cpu cores these packets then go

328
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,860
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual kernel module and so</font>

329
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,990
the switch and the kernel module will

330
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,729
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that packaging</font>

331
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,910
applications said i will send that of

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,800
port 34 make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that's actually</font>

333
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the case so the application needs to</font>

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">register make sure the port is free the</font>

335
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,389
OS agrees that it is and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes in</font>

336
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,190
packets and the module will check that

337
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:00,760
it keeps up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a registration at it</font>

338
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,740
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes out to the neck okay so</font>

339
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic setup and that's those</font>

340
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,120
are the results so TDP so we can do

341
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,450
different packet sizes and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

342
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">showing is that for any packet size 128</font>

343
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and bigger we can saturate in decline</font>

344
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,820
rate with a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU core and for</font>

345
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,970
minimum size packets with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two course we</font>

346
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,060
already saturate the entire thing big

347
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,740
pipe so that that's TX and then our<font color="#E5E5E5"> exit</font>

348
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the setup is basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same but</font>

349
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,770
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

350
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,100
and application we're using a packet

351
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:35,680
receive application and again we get

352
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:38,290
these this sort of nice curve where a

353
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,030
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU core is mostly enough for</font>

354
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,320
most packet sizes to get the tag line

355
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:46,120
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a single stack</font>

356
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,919
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single application what happens</font>

357
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,310
when you add multiple stacks

358
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,540
multiple applications so you add more

359
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,750
virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially to that switch</font>

360
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,030
on TX what is essentially happen is you

361
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,740
still have this filter checking that

362
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,480
each port is sending out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

363
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:08,500
tablet registered with and we see pretty

364
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,290
much line rate basically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

365
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,350
we're assigning a cpu core two to each

366
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:17,230
port in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the round-robin fashion and we</font>

367
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,790
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a port</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to 64 ports and you can</font>

368
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,210
see in the graph that we are able to

369
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,200
saturate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tingling going out with the</font>

370
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:28,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> forecourse that we have on the</font>

371
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:32,110
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay RX pretty similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get</font>

372
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:36,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this graph you can see in with 64 byte</font>

373
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:38,979
packets as we add ports the rate goes a

374
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,940
little bit down what happens here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

375
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,650
that the reduced number of packets

376
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,300
there's more ports so each time you call

377
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,730
is cisco on each port you receive your

378
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,560
packets since the cisco has a certain

379
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,290
overhead and so your rate goes a little

380
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,409
bit down but you still get 10 gigs with

381
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,970
those few ports so the performance

382
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,760
summary is you get for gigabits per

383
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:05,080
second for 64<font color="#E5E5E5"> by packets that you want</font>

384
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you yes um I did you mention the</font>

385
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,570
package in is this is a UDP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no to</font>

386
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:13,570
be this is UDP that's why we have the

387
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:17,710
packet sizes right right so the stock oh

388
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:21,100
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a sort of miniature oh</font>

389
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,620
this is just UDP a senior<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP so nice hhb</font>

390
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,990
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have at the one of last</font>

391
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,169
slides we do a minimalistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp stack</font>

392
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,410
and an HTTP server on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we</font>

393
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:34,780
have so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is it possible for you</font>

394
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,780
to run the real stack like the link

395
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">style or yes yeah in principle it is the</font>

396
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API that the</font>

397
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,810
courts have is the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> up API so as</font>

398
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,340
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the very bottom of your stock</font>

399
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> API which is pretty</font>

400
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:55,050
simple then yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run that stuff</font>

401
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks Jerry true Google</font>

402
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:01,240
so yeah the summary this is basically

403
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,740
numbers from the graphs which are not

404
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,330
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to reach from the graph stem</font>

405
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,890
cells it's for gigabits per second for

406
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,580
minimum size packets with a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU</font>

407
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:13,090
core 10 gigs for all packets with two

408
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,658
cpu cores and 10 gigs for 250 sites

409
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:19,570
packets with single speak or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so yeah</font>

410
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:22,299
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I slightly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned this so so far</font>

411
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very dumb UDP stock so what we</font>

412
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:27,610
did is we took or we call a micro TCP

413
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,519
which is a very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP stock just</font>

414
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,830
minimalistic TCP stock and we built a

415
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,730
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small HTTP server on top of that</font>

416
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:40,360
and that's the graph basically we

417
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:43,870
compare this against injects with with

418
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,049
TSO with the standard OS stack because

419
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,969
remember we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run our user level stack</font>

420
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:51,309
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same system as the whole stack so</font>

421
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:54,850
we can do nice comparisons and what you

422
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:56,830
can see V is there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bar all</font>

423
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:01,360
the way on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

424
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:04,090
micro tcp you tcp we can outperform the

425
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,219
host OS stack this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a big surprise</font>

426
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,260
because our stack is doing this work

427
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,210
it's not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that we're</font>

428
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,590
beating the standard tcp in the host is

429
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:14,409
to show that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get pretty good</font>

430
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,299
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Indy gigabits per</font>

431
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,649
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with an HTTPS our server</font>

432
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,330
running on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

433
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:22,510
like a hundred thousand requests per

434
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:25,110
second which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decent number given</font>

435
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:28,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a sort of low-end server</font>

436
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the conclusion is i presented</font>

437
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,029
multi stack it's always support for user

438
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:37,870
stacks the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

439
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:40,269
experiment and try to deploy protocol

440
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,699
new transfer protocols in a more timely

441
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,230
fashion I hope I convinced<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

442
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,720
maybe it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is of course</font>

443
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,090
a research project if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to try it</font>

444
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,130
out it's open source the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

445
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,840
and if you want to find out a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

446
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,669
details about it there's a sikkim<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCR</font>

447
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,689
paper that describes this in more detail

448
00:26:54,669 --> 00:27:01,929
yep not just always<font color="#CCCCCC"> park a couple of</font>

449
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,289
questions number one is did you consider

450
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:08,200
a potential performance hit by the fact

451
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:10,000
that you have to run multiple stacks so

452
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,720
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your experiments was there just one</font>

453
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,669
app made

454
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">be multi-threaded but it isn't all as</font>

455
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:15,549
though is supporting like any number of

456
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:17,289
applications running stacks and what the

457
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:20,110
performance it has for you or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the OS</font>

458
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah right so the stacks in these</font>

459
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,020
experiments were always the same but

460
00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:27,070
they were completely independent from

461
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:29,379
each other right so they had the same

462
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:31,418
weight but you know it's if the

463
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,520
experiment shows what the hit might be

464
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,350
of course the unrealistic part is that

465
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,908
the stack is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a very heavy stack that</font>

466
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:38,620
we were using it was a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> listing one</font>

467
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,840
no I mean if you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your system</font>

468
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:43,418
diagram that you had before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> support</font>

469
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,668
multi stacks by deal with isolation yeah

470
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,679
does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that you support multi</font>

471
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:50,169
stacks all with oscillation yeah come<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

472
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,530
a cost very very minimal that's why we

473
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:56,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">were having these sort of early graphs</font>

474
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,389
where we have a single stack and you can

475
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:02,110
get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can get practically</font>

476
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:04,450
Ryan line right with single CPU core so

477
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,719
compare that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not in the</font>

478
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:09,070
presentation but this is extensions to

479
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,600
the valley switch and if you compare the

480
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,799
values which performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers with</font>

481
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,928
the multi stock performance numbers

482
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,030
there within one percent because

483
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,890
ultimately what this module is doing is

484
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:20,168
doing a bit of three double filtering a

485
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:22,500
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D maxing and we did some</font>

486
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:24,669
extensions such that the performance

487
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,980
scales well with increasing number of

488
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,659
ports right I guess this comes at the

489
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,460
edge of the graph of performance right

490
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,750
but if if you because you're in user

491
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,650
space you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do more context which</font>

492
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,120
is between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different because</font>

493
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,140
whatever is are you doing yeah or so the

494
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,149
kernel space being able to process

495
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,830
everything and so on single people loop

496
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,360
then you end up running away yeah of

497
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,059
course umer performance of course

498
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,320
percentage points yes right yeah you're

499
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose something it's probably</font>

500
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,530
four percentage points that's the sort

501
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,580
of thing we measure but of course I you

502
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:54,760
can't beat the colonel right yeah

503
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">cherish your google game um so the</font>

504
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,480
multiple instance of stacks actually we

505
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is a preacher now bug actually got</font>

506
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:07,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of advantage of like isolation</font>

507
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:11,320
resource accounting accounting and also

508
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:16,299
the new pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> casual locality yeah so</font>

509
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:18,210
I to answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous person's</font>

510
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:23,900
caution we think this is an advantage

511
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:27,080
but one thing I I don't know you

512
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:31,940
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite difficult to pour</font>

513
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:35,300
the coal from real TV static pinging

514
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:39,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">south EST to run right you have only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

515
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:42,680
minister<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TV in bondage in here yeah</font>

516
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so that's one thing I I wonder how</font>

517
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,810
much it will you know you know I I agree

518
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I don't think I don't think it would</font>

519
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,530
make I wouldn't recommend any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you to</font>

520
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,149
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp stack out of the colonel</font>

521
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and sort of adapted and put it on top of</font>

522
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because that's not a trivial port</font>

523
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,939
and on top of that who would maintain

524
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,320
that afterwards you can do once you can

525
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,730
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice you can do it a nice</font>

526
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,350
research paper out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but who's going</font>

527
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,680
to maintain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right what's nice about</font>

528
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:10,399
so so so so we are a google we all

529
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:13,400
actually very interesting this this

530
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,120
configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we actually actively</font>

531
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,280
pursuing the work in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area okay um I</font>

532
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,870
hoped right so the answer to my question

533
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,170
is google when I said who would do this

534
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:26,270
it's google right but anyway by the way

535
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:30,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know all those other three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all servers</font>

536
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:33,220
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know uh yeah um I wonder how</font>

537
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:37,370
much your benefit problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

538
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:40,720
pussycat from lamb nap even if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

539
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:44,689
put this on you know on top of raw sake

540
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,990
and going to the colonel yeah without

541
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">any special Howard support by do you</font>

542
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:55,010
have a casa mia how much may you gather

543
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:57,169
most of the Bulls phone that map um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

544
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know I mean I i if you're asking</font>

545
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,790
me what would happen if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did this over</font>

546
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">d pdk for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> versus net back no I</font>

547
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,399
have three years is still our support

548
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:10,610
you know so well known<font color="#CCCCCC"> eppa doesn't</font>

549
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,110
require any any hardware support it has

550
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,139
some modifications<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the</font>

551
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,000
drivers but you only wonder dimas the

552
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,700
hash yeah but that's not yawning

553
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware yeah yeah so it doesn't have</font>

554
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,990
any hardware support I mean what it does

555
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,670
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does take some of the Intel</font>

556
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">tanguay cars won't get cards and emotive</font>

557
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,960
slightly modifies the the network

558
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,940
drivers but it doesn't use any of the

559
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">special order features in those cards</font>

560
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,430
right I see okay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you got all</font>

561
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,090
the mileage just by going somewhere

562
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:46,670
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> aepi yeah that's right Assange</font>

563
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:51,050
inches thanks Jen<font color="#CCCCCC"> iyengar high for the</font>

564
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:53,300
guy Harry I love this book I've seen

565
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:56,270
that letter paper when it came out while

566
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,770
ago and it's it's it's excellent I think

567
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a general direction</font>

568
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,420
in which the industry is moving its it's

569
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,800
very they're very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong clothes in</font>

570
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:10,010
it that it's happening but but the way

571
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,570
this work is cooked I I read it every

572
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,000
time reading I find it's smooth sailing

573
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:17,030
and then I hit some friction in and and

574
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,300
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tease that out though the</font>

575
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,940
motivations are very clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

576
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:27,399
stagnancy in sort of protocol deployment

577
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:30,230
and in evolving operating systems tax

578
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,940
the solution however seems to be

579
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,730
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows for rapid</font>

580
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:37,520
deployment on the server side which is

581
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the critical block right now the</font>

582
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,970
blockages are largely happening

583
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:44,629
client-side operating systems which we

584
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:50,030
can't push forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to that extent</font>

585
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:51,590
again tcp as a protocol yep does figure

586
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,320
into that problem the extensibility of

587
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:55,699
TCP is limited changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCP because it's</font>

588
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,649
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system on the</font>

589
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,650
client is<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited and you know that I'm</font>

590
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:04,090
biased because i work on quick and yeah

591
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:06,170
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> too that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right yeah so you</font>

592
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:08,510
we've had these discussions internally

593
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:10,910
for so you've hit one of the nails in

594
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,280
the eighth so for sure one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

595
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems is you require this kernel</font>

596
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,870
module<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and as you say what should</font>

597
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,070
be targeted is not servers or data

598
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,110
centers where we got control of stuff

599
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,840
anyways you should be targeting and

600
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:26,629
Cline's right Windows users<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux users</font>

601
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,280
and on laptops whatever and for those

602
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:30,350
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would need them up running on them</font>

603
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,240
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that right</font>

604
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can't ask them to run that so</font>

605
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,220
freebie<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the yes because its upstream</font>

606
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,990
and it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of turning it on</font>

607
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,060
Linux Liu ji has had less success in

608
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:42,590
putting that upstream because well

609
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,899
basically Liu ji has a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of glue</font>

610
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,270
between freebsd and linux code and it

611
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,620
sort of runs like great performance and

612
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:50,809
it worked well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not strictly</font>

613
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,518
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux like code and</font>

614
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,970
Linux community<font color="#E5E5E5"> one accepted and now</font>

615
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,190
we've covered about five people yeah

616
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,590
some previously on linux gone yeah so

617
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,870
for freebsd I can sort of fudge a story

618
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,418
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just turn it on even if</font>

619
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're an end user for linux and never</font>

620
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:10,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind windows you're absolutely right so</font>

621
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">I do have a suggestion also this wasn't</font>

622
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:14,359
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I wasn't pregnant dumped on</font>

623
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:16,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but because I do like that this</font>

624
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,779
this work is being done in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

625
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think it's an excellent use of</font>

626
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:25,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nick map yeah as well so I would love to</font>

627
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,569
see more work that looks at UDP

628
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:33,319
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because I'm sorry Yugi</font>

629
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:35,089
paper files udb<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah because not</font>

630
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:36,770
just quick but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are proposals are</font>

631
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:39,129
ideas that people now are thinking about

632
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:42,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">building transports on top of UDP and</font>

633
00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,909
for the use of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the client-side</font>

634
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,470
operating system was a block and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say</font>

635
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,089
that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the client side it's</font>

636
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:49,009
really the middle boxes that are

637
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:51,020
blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> even windows 10 now has</font>

638
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,060
upgrades every year so you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

639
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,859
ship upgrades the colonel odds over here

640
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,319
but nobody's going to be updating those

641
00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:00,740
boxes in the middle so we have a long

642
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:02,300
tail<font color="#E5E5E5"> there ago and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would love to see</font>

643
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,118
more work and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optimizing</font>

644
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,270
server-side and client-side performance

645
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,250
for UDP based transports that work i

646
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">think i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fantastic to see happen</font>

647
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,960
yeah you're absolutely right and in the

648
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,180
paper we didn't go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that argument</font>

649
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,819
too much because middleboxes and UDP

650
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,980
done don't like each other too much but

651
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:23,630
we do a lot of we use UDP a lot

652
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:26,869
especially in performance work because

653
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:29,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deterministic we can specify</font>

654
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:31,369
packet size as TCP is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

655
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,960
complicated Beast when you're charging

656
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,480
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tease out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the underlying</font>

657
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,280
performance is right thank you yeah

658
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome Kris Jenner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itamar Microsoft</font>

659
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,880
oilman this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting work</font>

660
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:48,230
and I like it and us as you said it's a

661
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">really easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be blowing itself or</font>

662
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:54,079
something like that by system of sensor

663
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:56,119
and on the graph that you should

664
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,630
initially about the deployment of TCP

665
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,910
options yeah the blocker is not really

666
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was not implemented in the in</font>

667
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:07,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system</font>

668
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:09,950
blocker as general said is that the

669
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,860
reason it was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned on is that when</font>

670
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:15,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you turn it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you get a lot of failure</font>

671
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,970
or due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a variety of firewalls and</font>

672
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,770
nuts and stuff like that yeah and

673
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:21,560
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in the operating</font>

674
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:24,050
system or in the application something

675
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,590
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that very much I mean quick</font>

676
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:31,250
does change at somewhat by sending and

677
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:33,380
cricket packets and adding encrypted

678
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,480
packets makes you fail your proof a

679
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,600
minute it's very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that</font>

680
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">point of view yep but unless you do</font>

681
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,500
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption of the packet</font>

682
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,690
and move to new protocols I mean the

683
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,600
impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meter box will basically</font>

684
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,240
slowed innovation in all cases yeah yeah

685
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,770
so in the paper we use the term well

686
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,479
well designed extensions to mean not

687
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:58,520
just anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to put out there</font>

688
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,440
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle boxes will drop a</font>

689
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,680
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things but yeah you're</font>

690
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely right and this this is one</font>

691
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,169
graph but there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nyeem see paper from</font>

692
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,460
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years back that it explains a lot</font>

693
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> effects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> including the ones you're</font>

694
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,650
making then when you go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clients</font>

695
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:20,120
side yeah there is another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is</font>

696
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:22,580
that when we do users<font color="#CCCCCC"> user level stack</font>

697
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,819
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the stack is now a</font>

698
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:28,520
library inside the application that

699
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:32,600
means that you passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update is by</font>

700
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:34,250
updating the application yeah there are

701
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,160
so application will get a bit too

702
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,700
frequently yeah but a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

703
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't yeah yeah so part of the work that</font>

704
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't here was to use sort of fast apic</font>

705
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,540
pose things like that input is sort of

706
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:52,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">glue in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between such that you have to</font>

707
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,120
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application only once but</font>

708
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,190
then you tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still have to</font>

709
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,740
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application and absolutely</font>

710
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,330
it's an open problem yeah so yeah that

711
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,120
that's kind of an avenue for research

712
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,950
because he I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you have this tension</font>

713
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,540
when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point about changing the</font>

714
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,939
operating system is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your debt all</font>

715
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:13,820
the old application in 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> school yeah</font>

716
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:15,020
and so it's I completely agree I don't

717
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,690
know if it would be possible to create

718
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,940
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ordinary tool that because</font>

719
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,010
the application you only need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

720
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,380
small bits of it so the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers of</font>

721
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,580
the the network calls I don't know if

722
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,970
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> automate the</font>

723
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:30,950
modification of that changing the code

724
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:32,930
such that you can modify to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in</font>

725
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case the network API or some sort</font>

726
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,899
of high-speed API I think well you will

727
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,130
need the source code that double become

728
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,900
the next problem but I think you could

729
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:44,150
probably have made parts of that

730
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:48,050
adaptation<font color="#CCCCCC"> later well we kind of see</font>

731
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:50,300
that with openssl right now yep bunch of

732
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,090
applications ship openssl inside the

733
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,660
application and when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bug in</font>

734
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,730
openssl you get to update all of those

735
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:04,270
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing yeah I</font>

736
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:06,890
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair enough natural so spark</font>

00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:09,950
the service funny coastal they were

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> least Lisa questions like person was</font>

743
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,069
mentioning on having potentially the

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,509
stack built into your application<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,680
maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a plug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right or not but</font>

746
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're doing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

747
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,230
defining a type of API underneath you

00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:31,430
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your case you're pushing them or</font>

751
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,430
might imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> having some library that</font>

752
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,379
goes into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCF has support for net</font>

753
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,850
map or do you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> something instinct</font>

754
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,790
eats its own stack and uses that the

755
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">community yeah at the same time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

756
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing like taps right we're</font>

757
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to abstract from a higher level</font>

758
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,440
above what we're providing underneath

759
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah right so we just divided our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API</font>

760
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,170
into two and cargar self a little sport

761
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little spot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little box that we now try</font>

762
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:01,820
to make an inter operate with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest</font>

763
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,800
of the network right that has the issue

764
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,960
of not allowing the protocols to evolve

765
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,410
right and we're basically fighting on

766
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,750
three fronts underneath above and

767
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,520
basically to the network side yeah which

768
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,200
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a funny puzzle that</font>

769
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,850
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight against which this</font>

770
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,040
present<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the community a good</font>

771
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,299
opportunity but a big fight right

772
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,740
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything everybody in</font>

773
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,110
different layers has their own interests

774
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:26,089
of things that point towards yeah

775
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:28,100
absolutely it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's completely a</font>

776
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,810
tussle I mean the stuff we work on is

777
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,750
only on two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those fronts which is</font>

778
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:33,029
either

779
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,340
compatibility with sockets<font color="#E5E5E5"> API or high</font>

780
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,160
performance with some other packet io

781
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,660
frameworks such as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDK</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mm up and</font>

782
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,220
pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you want you want</font>

783
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,640
compatibility or you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be tick</font>

784
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:45,899
tick tick and we pick speed but then

785
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,210
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not compatible anymore and they</font>

786
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,370
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to chase the applications and what</font>

787
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,290
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that's why I was I was</font>

788
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,609
suggesting maybe you can do some sort of

789
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,140
you can do an abstraction layer that's

790
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,050
one of the things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was suggesting which</font>

791
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,190
is what you're working on and then but

792
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">then people have to comply with that</font>

793
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,700
abstraction layer but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

794
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,890
better than our approach in terms of

795
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,210
compatibility but maybe you sacrifice a

796
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,569
little bit of performance maybe you

797
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:11,430
don't you know I think performance at

798
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,810
the OS side will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be okay i mean the</font>

799
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,399
client side is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have that issue</font>

800
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,170
right in the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can optimize the</font>

801
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,180
hell out of it whether it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> custom</font>

802
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,260
hardware software but it is an

803
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,919
interesting tussle in your probity

804
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:25,260
basically providing in your case weapons

805
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,600
right so we can fight and actually now

806
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,130
have a way to start deploying and figure

807
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,560
it out in in case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Google stays right</font>

808
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:32,900
they have their own controlling both

809
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,160
sides i try to figure out in the middle

810
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,480
there is a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting so I'm</font>

811
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,620
a highly in favor and I think you should

812
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,060
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the work in them maybe</font>

813
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:43,279
some of us will well join on the

814
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,279
different sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this tussle Thank You</font>

815
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:51,360
Jen I and God again so I didn't I I said

816
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,490
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd suggest i</font>

817
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,290
recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at you repeat</font>

818
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,350
performance I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you</font>

819
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:59,270
actually had and I had a more specific

820
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:02,580
recommendation have you looked at the

821
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,800
difference in so good net Matt and but

822
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:08,100
this tack have you actually looked at

823
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,200
performance over UDP vs<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and how</font>

824
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">different they are and actually with</font>

825
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,589
respect the one thing I'm assuming

826
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using some sort of TSO style and</font>

827
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:22,530
offload for for some of the TCP ones yes

828
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,550
yes but the end of the presentation but

829
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:28,170
all the other base tests or EDP yeah

830
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,910
right so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you is not in</font>

831
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,210
not in this work but some of the other

832
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff that we we build a high-speed</font>

833
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:38,850
virtualized content caches and we still

834
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:41,700
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net map API for those and I</font>

835
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,810
guess you must absolutely turn TSO on

836
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,169
otherwise you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die so</font>

837
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:49,630
so in the interest of thinking about

838
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:52,300
evolving protocols on you d be yep that

839
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:56,500
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a limitation that still stands yeah</font>

840
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,660
so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school there for work</font>

841
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,870
that needs to be done in terms of

842
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:03,700
figuring out how to reduce that cost

843
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,650
when you're doing offload how can you

844
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,500
get something that's equivalent to TSO

845
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:14,470
four generic unity based transports yeah

846
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:16,930
I completely yeah I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks I uh</font>

847
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:19,120
Brian Trammell um I think I've already

848
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,410
actually told you like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when</font>

849
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,580
the you were working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the paper that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

850
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:27,759
like this work I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work um</font>

851
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:29,529
so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to one thing you</font>

852
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,840
said about sort of like UDP versus tcp

853
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,690
middle box interference it's actually

854
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,160
way more complicated than that I'd like

time machine and come back to the map RV

857
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,190
session yesterday because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

858
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,450
some some sort of active measurement I'm

859
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,920
trying to tease this out and it's

860
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a lot more complicated UDP and</font>

861
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,730
TCP or broken in different ways yeah

862
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:56,020
bye-bye metal boxes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet um a</font>

863
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,670
second thing that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say there's</font>

864
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,800
currently some work going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

865
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,730
stack evolution program<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh it's</font>

866
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,980
basically I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to nacho</font>

867
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:07,150
we're another<font color="#E5E5E5"> group of people who are</font>

868
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,920
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the weapons you're</font>

869
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:10,510
providing us in this slightly different

870
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,330
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um so I'd encourage you</font>

871
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,410
actually take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to continue</font>

872
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:17,140
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this work and we'll be in</font>

873
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,629
touch ok thank ya thanks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot yeah you</font>

874
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,710
know on the first statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to</font>

875
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:25,840
summarize the 12-page imc paper about

876
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:28,360
middleboxes in one sentence and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

877
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,400
i failed<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> senator is</font>

878
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:35,110
it's complicated yeah it's really

879
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated I agree thank you very much</font>

880
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,560
thanks

881
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:06,980
I mean do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something or</font>

882
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,980
should I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

883
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:40,630
the kind of works right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have</font>

884
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">another about I guess 40 minutes to talk</font>

885
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:46,510
about current and future hot topics in

886
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,730
TV and what we like you guys to do is to

887
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,590
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what's a hot topics</font>

888
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:54,100
you've been talking about to others in

889
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:55,900
the hallways or<font color="#E5E5E5"> insight meetings and let</font>

890
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,690
the larger community know or what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

891
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,700
hot topics you would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss in</font>

892
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,230
the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> future what do you think is</font>

893
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,439
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know from outside that</font>

894
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:07,120
should be discussed in the IDF and also

895
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,830
we were hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there may be a</font>

896
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,859
couple of people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting who are</font>

897
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:13,720
not usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> only active in the transport</font>

898
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,690
area but also in other areas so if you

899
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:20,890
if you think you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen something over</font>

900
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">their last two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days basically in a</font>

901
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,770
different area that can be interesting

902
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:25,390
to the transport air please let us know

903
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,009
please come to Mike and let us know or

904
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:28,180
if you have seen something in a

905
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,400
completely different<font color="#CCCCCC"> firm in a</font>

906
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,350
conference or in another sanitization

907
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,330
organization which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting for</font>

908
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:42,250
transport come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike and let us</font>

909
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:44,350
know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess one part is what we</font>

910
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,600
already started discussing with the

911
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:49,960
previous presentation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech evolution</font>

912
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,670
and as previously summarized already

913
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:55,900
there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on like</font>

914
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:57,700
taps but also in other areas and I could

915
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,510
imagine that some of you have additional

916
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,509
thoughts on this

917
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:17,509
hi I'm al Morton I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bring up a</font>

918
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:21,290
topic which all I had to do was mention

919
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:23,570
at a workshop last year and Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush</font>

920
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:28,520
came to them another microphone and

921
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:34,190
yelled rattle so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its speed</font>

922
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">measurement and i think that there's</font>

923
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,840
certainly an interaction between what is

924
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:43,310
being developed for the future of

925
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">transport and what we will ultimately</font>

926
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:49,730
measure for speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

927
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:54,140
figure out how to measure the speed of

928
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:57,080
IP packet transfer but the minute you go

929
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:59,960
anywhere above that and start to have

930
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:02,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">significance for user applications it's</font>

931
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:05,560
a very complicated problem we've been

932
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:09,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on this for a while Matt and</font>

933
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:12,680
Matt Mathis of course and another's up

934
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:15,319
in tackling this for years but we're on

935
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,450
the verge now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the regulators are</font>

936
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,800
not going to leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> us alone anymore and</font>

937
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:24,279
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have something that we can</font>

938
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:29,030
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree on here I believe that is</font>

939
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:31,640
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and relevant and fair</font>

940
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,440
to the service providers and it may mean

941
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,879
that there are multiple methods of

942
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,520
measurement to do that in the end but I

943
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,490
think that's I mean it's unfortunate

944
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,530
that we may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this more quickly</font>

945
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,689
than we would like but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

946
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the hot topics at least as a as a</font>

947
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:52,760
service provider I have to I'm having to

948
00:48:51,140 --> 00:49:00,049
deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more often than I want to</font>

949
00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:03,070
now thanks Christian Rita ma<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

950
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:06,050
Microsoft you're asking what kind of

951
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:09,230
interesting stuff we we could do what's

952
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:12,890
popping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is new at the high level</font>

953
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:17,470
what is very new is not new but it's a

954
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:19,490
new focus it's the focus on latency a

955
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,279
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done in</font>

956
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,160
transport

957
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:26,040
historically has been on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fair</font>

958
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,970
sharing of resource and achieving a

959
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:33,150
third showing of bandwidth in particular

960
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:36,480
but we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really have the focus on</font>

961
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:38,820
latency if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the controls we</font>

962
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:42,000
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp and things like that they are</font>

963
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:44,190
not oriented it to us latency if you

964
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,880
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow start for example</font>

965
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:51,990
behaves in hi banwa stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> network it</font>

966
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:55,560
creates huge spikes in latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

967
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:59,100
seems like that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see and if we</font>

968
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:01,620
did say hey what are all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

969
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:05,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are doing in the values where we tune</font>

970
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:07,730
the transports that contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

971
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:11,550
increasing the latency in the network

972
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:16,080
then we could probably have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

973
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:19,080
interesting action of course one thing

974
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:23,480
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is the work on active queue</font>

975
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:26,370
management but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very little</font>

976
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:28,050
synchronization between the active queue

977
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:32,700
management and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolution of</font>

978
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:37,760
transport for example there was a box

979
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:43,220
message about<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you cuddle explain how</font>

980
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:45,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploying fair queuing in a router is</font>

981
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,509
going to actually pesum eyes your

982
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:50,610
performance if a lot of your traffic is

983
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:55,530
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic that would have</font>

984
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:59,310
otherwise slowed down so this business

985
00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:01,050
of latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the management</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of latency</font>

986
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:03,540
in the network interference with the

987
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:06,890
transport that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we can</font>

988
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,890
probably study quite a bit

989
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:17,840
hi Brian Trammell mainly I got up here

990
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I wanted to yell rat hole @ @l</font>

991
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,190
and then he took the rat hole and he

992
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:25,100
threw a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lawyers in it um which</font>

993
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,060
makes it even more fun um and then

994
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,440
Christian said something about latency

995
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,810
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember there was this</font>

996
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,370
workshop that I sock did a few years ago

<font color="#E5E5E5">about sort of like reducing internet</font>

00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:35,240
ladies yeah there's ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hawk and right</font>

999
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,830
put this together it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in some</font>

1000
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,029
dreadful hotel in London that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1001
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:40,870
different than the dreadful hotel in

1002
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:43,100
London<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were in for the IDF and</font>

1003
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:44,600
there was a there's a little sort of

1004
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,400
side conversation that went it went

1005
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,710
nowhere there it was how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure</font>

1006
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:53,420
latency of an access network so that you

1007
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:54,860
can actually give um service providers

1008
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,710
something other than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dimensional</font>

1009
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,420
number that they can compete on and we

1010
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:01,550
got nowhere with it and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1011
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:03,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might it might be it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a rat</font>

1013
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:09,470
lawyers um but going beyond sort of like

1014
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:12,730
the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipe so step one is going</font>

1015
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:17,600
beyond basic the basic IP transport

1016
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:19,730
measurement um to you know something on

1017
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then step two is then</font>

1018
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,190
getting some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of number that talks</font>

1019
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:29,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interaction between latency</font>

1020
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:32,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> low end and capacity I mean there's</font>

1021
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">been a lot of of emphasis on reducing</font>

1022
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:37,160
buffer bloat and that's been good that's

1023
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:39,200
been theirs but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the idea that</font>

1024
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,120
some Q is good there for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> morkie was</font>

1025
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,029
better and therefore all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q is the</font>

1026
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,759
best we've we've kind of managed to beat

1027
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the industry or at least if</font>

1028
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,090
it's the industry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to us but</font>

1029
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,040
it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1030
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,860
well what are the other points along

1031
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,390
that curve other than other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than just</font>

1032
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we can get through reducing with</font>

1033
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,950
you and being a little bit smarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1034
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,359
how we use it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to sit</font>

1035
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:04,040
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about what Christian just</font>

1036
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">said about about making the transport</font>

1038
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,860
will note that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things</font>

1039
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about sort of in the</font>

1040
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">spud work for those of you who are</font>

1041
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:15,350
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did some new</font>

1042
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,770
documents we post the links to those to

1043
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:21,140
the spud and the stock<font color="#E5E5E5"> Evo discuss lists</font>

1044
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:23,360
yesterday where we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sort</font>

1045
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,848
of knobs that you can put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font>

1046
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially like the</font>

traffic expressing its preferences about

1048
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:32,229
the aqm thresholds it would like to see

1049
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:36,729
so we're at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> very beginning of that</font>

1050
00:53:32,229 --> 00:53:38,558
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we have anything like</font>

1051
00:53:36,729 --> 00:53:39,819
I don't even have consensus with myself

1052
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,279
as to whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the stuff we're</font>

1053
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:43,180
thinking about there is correct but but

1054
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:46,690
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be an interesting</font>

1055
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to dig into a little bit deeper so</font>

1056
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,109
before you want to wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I just</font>

1057
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,450
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you said we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had this</font>

1058
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:54,308
latency workshop while ago a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font>

1059
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:57,129
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we should actually go back and</font>

1060
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:58,599
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the report and see which because</font>

1061
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,579
we just introduced at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

1062
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:04,059
and I got to do was for example and

1063
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:05,829
supporting easy and support yep another

1064
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">one was a km I think this was like the</font>

1065
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:09,519
starting point of the Aiken working

1066
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,630
group and there were other to do so we

1067
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,038
should probably have a look at it and

1068
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,289
maybe you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to post a link to</font>

1069
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:15,940
the report on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list if I can</font>

1070
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:17,319
find it and then if i can make sure that

1071
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:26,109
there aren't two dues that are still

1072
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:27,670
pending that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I would do so gori</font>

1073
00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:30,848
first responded a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

1074
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">Christian and I kind of by what he said</font>

1075
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:35,319
but I also don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do</font>

1076
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:37,479
transports really for furnace fairness

1077
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:39,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just kind of a thing that comes</font>

1078
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:41,710
because we don't want starvation we

1079
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:45,160
don't want congestion collapse so it's a

1080
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:48,039
more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism and the fkn fq</font>

1081
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:49,839
cuddle is Fleur Fleur puing the idea

1082
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:51,849
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't provide starvation</font>

1083
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,410
and I think these these things are so

1084
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:55,119
important and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we seem</font>

1085
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:57,670
to be missing is combining things like

1086
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,680
diffserv and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> qm where the ecn and</font>

1087
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,569
putting this together as a package to

1088
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:03,848
try and solve some of the problems we're

1089
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:06,489
seeing other people propose much more

1090
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:08,499
exotic solutions for I think we have a

1091
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:11,469
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good techniques and it's the</font>

1092
00:55:08,499 --> 00:55:13,598
furnace thing the idea of competing with

1093
00:55:11,469 --> 00:55:15,309
traffic is just just came about in the

1094
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,259
past but now we have better techniques

1095
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:20,279
and we we have ways of doing this I

1096
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:22,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to explore things</font>

1097
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:25,059
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that's not those</font>

1098
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,729
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the platform I think this is</font>
