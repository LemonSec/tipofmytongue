appreciate your help for review we're

143
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,850
just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this face to get the</font>

144
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,730
requirements hand it off to net come and

145
00:13:47,850 --> 00:14:13,410
see if we can start the net come back

146
00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:16,680
and forth go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay r2s uh this</font>

147
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:22,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is my hackathon picture and keep going</font>

148
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:29,550
out one more diverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now works push</font>

149
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:32,100
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh wrong way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's cool ok so we</font>

150
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:35,880
originally started a hackathon and we

151
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:39,540
thought we would participate went<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

152
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Liam did the delete subscription to the</font>

153
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,579
gang push and then we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just get an</font>

154
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,310
environment because in it in hey the

155
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,680
hackathon 94 we had much problem trying

156
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:52,619
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a no dl environment up this time</font>

157
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,680
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-loaded the OTL environment and it</font>

158
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,140
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about 20 minutes downloaded that</font>

159
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,250
was a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then run it it was</font>

160
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:05,370
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better I of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ran it oh the</font>

161
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:07,830
odl environment on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ubuntu well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Edwin</font>

162
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kordell Oh had done that and set it up</font>

163
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us and he couldn't be here so he</font>

164
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,120
sent it our problem is he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

165
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,520
running on a fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> large server with</font>

166
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,850
multi course so just kept<font color="#CCCCCC"> pouring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on our</font>

167
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,640
laptops going back and forth so being

168
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,730
hackers we decided we're going to try a

169
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,069
new goal maybe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was vertical and our</font>

170
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,040
goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to set up an environment with</font>

171
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:35,340
you bunt to native and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual box try</font>

172
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,060
to get min net min x net set up routers

173
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:46,050
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yuma pro which is a downloadable</font>

174
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:48,630
free net<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kumpf CLI CLI to net come use</font>

175
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:51,779
quagga as a router so we can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

176
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:56,579
delete routes and use cisco tell f

177
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,389
as our net conf server that would act

178
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:03,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">like the arduous agent and try to add a</font>

179
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:07,139
model and myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> thon thetic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason Stern</font>

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lucy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Mamadou and Mamadou if you hear</font>

181
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,870
I'm so sorry if I've mispronounced it

182
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,790
again at 0 and hits it's really cool

183
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:19,949
because he's a first-time participant

184
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,170
from French Ghana so I was real thrilled

185
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:24,389
about that so it actually worked we got

186
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,339
further this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we did in about six</font>

187
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,980
hours we got the builds working we

188
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:32,249
figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the CLI we got downloaded</font>

189
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,110
the company we got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> men</font>

190
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:37,199
that took a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more to put in</font>

191
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,389
the virtual environment it was without

192
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,269
the virtual environment in the regular

193
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:45,300
environment the stuff came up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

194
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:46,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the middle of hacking this RPC now</font>

195
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,319
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought to do it in the</font>

196
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:52,649
hackathon was simply to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it as</font>

197
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:54,930
another protocol like ospf and when it

198
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,759
wrote over the configuration it wrote

199
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:00,660
over it which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

200
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:03,809
higher priority seems really simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

201
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,959
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this was a really simple so</font>

202
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,970
it just had a set of glue and it looked

203
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,659
like another routing demon and it wrote

204
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:15,089
routes into the route table should be

205
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:17,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that simple hopefully with lots of</font>

206
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:32,399
routes okay that gives you all the

207
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:35,970
details you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it online now the</font>

208
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:39,209
wreath the reason the push subscription

209
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:43,590
is the pub sub was required from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs</font>

210
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,740
and so Eric was is gotten code in<font color="#E5E5E5"> od</font>

211
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Allen Oh dl's data model that they use</font>

212
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,450
for topology is the IRS data model so

213
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,520
you basically if you're using that

214
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using an ir 2 s data model</font>

215
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,100
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that data models basic</font>

216
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,470
concepts are what T's is using for

217
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,399
traffic engineering and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

218
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,090
tease so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly simple piece</font>

219
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:09,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so</font>

220
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,100
they had a net comp API they pushed it

221
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,409
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscriber to net come to the</font>

222
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,559
publisher where they published interface

223
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:18,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">States ACL and routes sound familiar and</font>

224
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,820
they also had a subscriber that was just

225
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,029
a terminal and that would they were

226
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,439
working on the delete code delete

227
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:29,070
subscription and they've already

228
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,900
demonstrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so they've</font>

229
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">been working along and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason we</font>

230
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,610
finally got you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out later on why</font>

231
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,399
we said we've just started implementing

232
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,229
it because it makes a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more</font>

233
00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:42,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense if you start playing with the code</font>

234
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,179
and there's bits and bytes in this one

235
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:49,620
tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead we don't have our</font>

236
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:51,690
router up and glued so we'll post<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the</font>

237
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,418
source code when we get it done and we

238
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:58,770
hope to show this and the another demo

239
00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:01,309
at ITF 96 we hope to show both the

240
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:06,899
filter based rib and the route rib and

241
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:10,740
the subscription shows you the topology

242
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:13,289
those are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I to RS ribs the rest</font>

243
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,940
are things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP ribs and we'll hope</font>

244
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:16,940
maybe we'll show bgp rip to

245
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:37,539
okay this is where we had a long

246
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:39,580
discussion on Tuesday and what's the

247
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:41,679
background for this one of the fun

248
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,620
things that chair gets to do before they

249
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,440
send things off let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one step</font>

250
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,039
back I<font color="#E5E5E5"> to asses a reused protocol as i</font>

251
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,899
said earlier be reusing net compn we're

252
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,669
we're using rest comp as our chosen

253
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:59,469
protocols and we're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net conf</font>

254
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,720
working group which is handling<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

255
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,570
conf<font color="#CCCCCC"> andres comp what changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

256
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,049
should make this is a new style the is

257
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:10,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">G's encouraged so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see it's</font>

258
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:13,450
already borne fruit there's the push

259
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,880
model coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that comp for lots of</font>

260
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,970
things but I r2s is coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

261
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,970
femoral state and some of this bush and

262
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:24,640
traceability so what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

263
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:28,110
look at it and say before we send them

264
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:33,010
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one what's left that we have to</font>

265
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:35,949
work on data requirements so the chair

266
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,289
it's the joyful thing of finding someone

267
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:41,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">or doing it themselves to actually look</font>

268
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:43,480
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data flow requirements and I took</font>

269
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,710
a crack at it myself but please if you

270
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,570
have are better at this don't feel shy

271
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,909
so the first thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and we need</font>

272
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:54,039
really some implementation notice how

273
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:58,870
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning to turn from this is</font>

274
00:20:54,039 --> 00:21:01,029
wonderful Theory to what works one of

275
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,989
the things than I we<font color="#CCCCCC"> started this</font>

276
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:07,809
process a year ago maybe more 18 months

277
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:13,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago we went out and said to people who</font>

278
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing odl who were doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh other</font>

279
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:20,980
open source who wanted this I to us in

280
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:23,860
the face so what do you want how do you

281
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:28,270
want to dump routes and I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one</font>

282
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:31,559
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on open source and they</font>

283
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:34,029
said I already on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my are to his client</font>

284
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:36,309
check everything I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want you to</font>

285
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:39,820
check the bites and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fails it fails</font>

286
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:42,540
and I pick up the pieces I think if we

287
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:45,270
were in another protocol say AKA

288
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,659
bgp we call this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to shoot</font>

289
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:51,090
your foot and if you shoot you what you

290
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,690
shoot your foot but maybe it's the type

291
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:58,470
of advanced technique you might need but

292
00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:01,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">I need I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact the</font>

293
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,990
original suggester to see if he still

294
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,480
wants it after another 18 months of

295
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,510
development but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

296
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,620
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on development let me know if</font>

297
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:15,629
you want the g minimum checks just check

298
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,080
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bites came off the wire because</font>

299
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:23,340
you're doing your checks in the r2s so

300
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:25,110
that's one then someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> said well maybe</font>

301
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,270
I went a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i really want</font>

302
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,419
referential checks I don't want the

303
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:34,889
musts I don't want the leaf<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaths</font>

304
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:37,380
because that'll take more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that's</font>

305
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:44,100
another option the standing option is

306
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:46,620
the full<font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom function given no real</font>

strong thing for version<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will do</font>

308
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:52,139
the net come full validation which may

309
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,179
take time if we get six months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

310
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,910
get a lot of inflammation feedback will

311
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,450
send back a comment saying we need to

312
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,700
have the minimum referential now I'm

313
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,410
going to pause here are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Embree</font>

00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a doctor but yes are there any</font>

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,250
the chairs privately we really to

320
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,380
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> your issues discuss how you</font>

321
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,720
might want it but again given nothing

322
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,530
else we will go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> full validation</font>

323
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:38,430
until we find something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok now the</font>

324
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:41,520
second one we've agreed that although

325
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:44,070
some people are using proto buffs and IP

to code yourself if you can go talk to

<font color="#CCCCCC">your buddies who are coding this sort of</font>

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,980
one's come up a few times I understood

346
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,020
you guys are converging on making a

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of mandatory implement this is</font>

348
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:48,100
mandatory to implement but also in the

349
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,200
preliminary spec you're going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

350
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,330
have a hook that would allow other

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,220
proprietary extensions or whatever that

352
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,110
made you start off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proprietary and</font>

353
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,670
may get standard later but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's</font>

354
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,709
too good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you separate so</font>

355
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,320
that people could use other transports

356
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:03,430
or whatever recordings the experience

357
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,679
we're seeing it a couple of the vendors

358
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that do have this stuff in flight is</font>

359
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,800
that not everybody's starting with

<font color="#CCCCCC">Metcalfe not everybody starting with you</font>

361
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,669
know any particular external transport

362
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:20,740
such as your pc or thrift and basically

363
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,570
what we're likely to see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rendezvous</font>

364
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,880
towards common data models which is

365
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,860
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing IETF why'd you</font>

366
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,110
know some level of common transports and

367
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,510
at some point we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to</font>

368
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:34,510
do something to interoperate right now

369
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:37,270
all I TF has is a common set of things

370
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:40,629
that are IETF specifications are you

371
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,190
know that conf and yang at some point we

372
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,080
may decide know what does the mapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

373
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,730
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things look like into one</font>

374
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,830
of the other either transports like your

375
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:52,780
pc or your formats such as go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bucks</font>

376
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:57,159
there is no reason after we<font color="#CCCCCC"> shipped the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">first protocol requirements over the net</font>

378
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,780
count that we can't take a new set of

379
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,050
requirements and finalized as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff and I</font>

380
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,260
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found it takes a longer time than</font>

381
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,909
we thought so if you if we close on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

382
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,740
and next week you say

383
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:14,170
or in a couple weeks and you say oops I

384
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,850
missed it just start in with proposing

385
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:22,510
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is we</font>

386
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to have resource constraints ok so</font>

387
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:29,790
the archer s actions were overload the

389
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:35,170
plugged into some of the OEM that helps

390
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,450
you track it but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a piece where</font>

391
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,150
we're going to say we can't overload the

392
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:43,690
router with our 2s and we've got to have

393
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:46,390
some ability to to bring it back that's

394
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:50,710
sort of where we got on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tuesday other</font>

395
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:52,960
people have asked right now we have a

396
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,330
single pane of glass for config in a

397
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,330
single pane of glass that's been on the

398
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,129
list that and I and you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

399
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,399
that just like what I had in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo</font>

400
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:06,730
the config writes a value there's a

401
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,610
priority between the two pans excuse me

402
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're two panes can fake an hour to s</font>

403
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:16,719
both panes have a value let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

404
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment and r 2 s is 10 and</font>

405
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,530
configures one then I urge us would win

406
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:25,540
and if you wrote a route with config our

407
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,310
choice would right over it and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go</font>

408
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,159
through some examples I'm just trying to

409
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">be clear for this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're not</font>

410
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do om two om protocols or IP</font>

411
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,920
fix and that's it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our summary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

412
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

413
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:07,149
okay this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of the protocol</font>

414
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:09,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it is meant to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be simple but where</font>

415
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,510
we are running in is this used to be the

416
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:16,120
world of config before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OP state</font>

417
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:19,000
changes to net mod so some of what we're

418
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,520
struggling over is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference terms</font>

419
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,799
that really don't sort of match what

420
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,840
we're doing in the demos that's how we

421
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,820
come we went to the demos you may laugh

422
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,110
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably something you've seen</font>

423
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,939
before so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous world</font>

424
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:37,840
this is the RFC that says you have

425
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,600
metadata about config state data

426
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,289
notification operation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your a model</font>

427
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,049
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an artist client and server</font>

428
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:50,230
instead exchanges in a fem attended cake

429
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:52,990
config that it wants to apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

430
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:57,399
server and it's dr state when something

431
00:28:52,990 --> 00:29:01,240
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp or LDP generates things so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

432
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:04,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">could stop you here who here in the room</font>

433
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,130
has seen some form of this app state

434
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:10,870
type stuff and other presentations

435
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:12,820
including net mod and net conf now this

436
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is important because a lot of the places</font>

437
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:18,850
were hung up on has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do number one</font>

438
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:21,309
with consistent terminology used in<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

440
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:25,990
ephemeral fits in with the app<font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font>

441
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,459
terminology that has been introduced for

442
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:33,070
open config if you don't understand this

443
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,419
you're going to be lost so if you have

444
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:40,570
questions please come to the microphone

445
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:42,399
please s now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

446
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,200
reason we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over this is if you</font>

447
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,860
try to read it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you see it</font>

448
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,899
change because we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adapt to</font>

449
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,729
the changes that's hat that are

450
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:54,908
happening through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP state draft</font>

451
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,000
from that mod we just want you to be

452
00:29:54,909 --> 00:30:00,960
informed it is a frustration to the

453
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,929
authors and to other places but

454
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,250
it is where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the IDF now this</font>

455
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the RFC 6244 and the femoral State</font>

456
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:14,070
dropped into that so it goes from

457
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:18,289
intended config to one that's applied to

458
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:23,850
drive state which hopefully to the naive

459
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:27,960
looks as easy as I thought it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

460
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,158
so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it sorry that's Jason</font>

461
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,570
here just to back on the previous slide

462
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:33,480
I know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having some discussions</font>

463
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,100
about this but this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note in the</font>

464
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,070
bottom left are showing intended as

465
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,899
separate from ephemeral and I I think

466
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,178
we'll may want to make sure we're

467
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:44,729
consistent with the other slides on no

468
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:48,289
no I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the box was</font>

469
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:55,590
supposed to be all intended my apologies

470
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:59,390
just minute I'll do the oh I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

471
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:59,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pointer oh that is at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pointer</font>

472
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:17,908
pardon you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your pointer oh</font>

473
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:24,360
look at you or me thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just</font>

474
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">will put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back in slide mode so over</font>

475
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:32,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">here I've got a great hope you hear me</font>

476
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:36,620
in the back without<font color="#CCCCCC"> the night yeah okay</font>

477
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,890
if federal stay is all this year as the

478
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,830
applied config is<font color="#CCCCCC"> transform it coming</font>

479
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:47,520
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attendance in the ephemeral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

480
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:50,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five and then when you get to</font>

481
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,990
drive state it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that's right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

482
00:31:50,250 --> 00:32:02,210
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that bgp and ospf</font>

483
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:07,110
formulas do that and that was fun ok

484
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:09,570
let's go on so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we if you see the</font>

485
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,539
documentation we turned that into

486
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,300
intended config applied config and

487
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,180
derive state

488
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,610
and the real thing is if you have can if

489
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:22,790
you go into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang models and see</font>

490
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:26,149
config true it occurs in intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

491
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:29,620
the ephemeral config and the applied can

492
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:34,750
fake but the applied config is read-only

493
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:37,610
config<font color="#CCCCCC"> falses all the derive state ok</font>

494
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:40,010
memorize<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little document if you</font>

495
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,800
read documents or just put it next to

496
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:48,260
you because this took us a little bit to

497
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:51,649
dig out of the Upstate stuff now for a

498
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:55,150
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple temperature let's assume</font>

499
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,920
we're in an energy-efficient world and

500
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,920
we're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one of these rooms like</font>

501
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,230
I was upstairs and the default is to let

502
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,450
it go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 and I'm getting sleepier and</font>

503
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,640
sleepier and I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should do</font>

504
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,380
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and turn it back to 72 so</font>

505
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,740
again you have the desired temperature

506
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,700
degrees Celsius<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual temperature</font>

507
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:17,810
for operational state a very simple one

508
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,180
so again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your desired</font>

509
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:23,060
temperature that goes from a running to

510
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:26,060
an intended config and then gets applied

511
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:30,820
and then you have an actual state so

512
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:35,330
what happens if you have this online

513
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:38,090
please reset my temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having a</font>

514
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:42,520
hard time falling asleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in I us well</font>

515
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:45,169
the our truest client would overwrite it

516
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:49,250
over late excuse me thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

517
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:56,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">trimmers overlay the 80 degrees on top</font>

518
00:33:49,250 --> 00:34:00,230
of the on top of the 80 degrees would

519
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:03,140
lay the ephemeral 72 degrees and because

520
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:05,990
it for our example<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> higher</font>

521
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:10,040
priority for me to be cool it will turn

522
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,320
to 72 and that will get applied and then

523
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,090
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> derive state</font>

524
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,610
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the temperature you're reading</font>

525
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,429
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to 72 and I will be</font>

526
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">comfortable and not fall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asleep actually</font>

527
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:27,520
sue go back yep show of hands who in the

528
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,520
room is<font color="#CCCCCC"> following this example</font>

529
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:35,960
sorry hi Bill Fenner I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

530
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,268
which I've had since I saw this slide

531
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,539
before so since we're now talking about

532
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:43,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's everybody understand it the thing</font>

533
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:45,909
that I don't quite get is what's a

534
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:51,558
femoral state you only have one state

535
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:53,839
right what is ephemeral state so because

536
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:56,480
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only one temperature in</font>

537
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,460
the room the current temperature if i'm

538
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,049
reading the temperature but though if

539
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:03,170
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading the temperature that's</font>

540
00:35:00,049 --> 00:35:05,089
the drive state right so if you attack a

541
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,499
couple of slides it showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

542
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:10,069
was a separate thing that was a femoral

543
00:35:06,499 --> 00:35:14,180
state another<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you go that's the</font>

544
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:17,900
intended config this is this box here up

545
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:20,058
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top up here second one down on</font>

546
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:29,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right hand ah ephemeral state what's</font>

547
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:31,460
a femoral Stewie<font color="#CCCCCC"> humains yeah so let's</font>

548
00:35:29,809 --> 00:35:33,019
walk through these things real quick so

549
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,489
let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the slide that we</font>

550
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">just left so one of the things that's</font>

551
00:35:37,489 --> 00:35:41,390
really causing us problems is a lot of

552
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:45,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names are coming from things that</font>

553
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:47,779
are stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> metcalf materials you look at</font>

554
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:49,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like candidate and that probably</font>

555
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,900
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense apologize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the people</font>

556
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:54,619
online when I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stain to the</font>

557
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,380
camera so candidate is specifically the

558
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,789
store on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metcalfe server when you're</font>

559
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,190
allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually edit the</font>

560
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:04,759
configuration on a temporary scratch

561
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,319
copy that is not in effect so candidate

562
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:08,210
has a name that everybody thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

563
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:10,249
know what they mean it has an explicit

564
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:13,369
meaning in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net conf datastore</font>

565
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:15,019
protocol the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is true</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

566
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:18,049
start-up you think you know what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

567
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:19,879
it is specifically the data store that

568
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:21,829
is present on some systems because not

569
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,430
every system needs support a start-up

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,490
that they have put very simple very

you've applied a running config and you

something you change to a local data

hour before supply to the network we get

into the femoral dick Adele candidate

625
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,370
stuff this is where we start introducing

626
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">hrs concept so what do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean is I</font>

00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:48,290
dress by ephemeral now number one it you

628
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,540
know we do use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sense that</font>

English does this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does</font>

630
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,210
not generally persist it doesn't hangs

631
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,310
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can change</font>

632
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:59,890
we intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not persist</font>

633
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,060
if you were to reboot<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box and we</font>

634
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,279
were to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the three standard</font>

that comp<font color="#CCCCCC"> data stores above if the I</font>

636
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,100
tres ephemeral state would not be

637
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:10,209
present without being reprogrammed and

638
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,910
more importantly the thing that we're

639
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,610
actually implying is that on top of the

640
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">running config or as know thee running</font>

the intended configures the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OP State</font>

642
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,299
guys we're trying to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a snow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font>

643
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:25,779
stuff now we now<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ephemeral state as</font>

644
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,580
a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have running you have on</font>

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,070
top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

646
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,480
priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to set up that way you know</font>

647
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:35,050
some amount of state that is being

648
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:36,280
overlaid or overridden and that state

649
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,650
you know if you haven't clear the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

650
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust piece of it would flush out and</font>

651
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,120
you would still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the original</font>

652
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,980
statically configured stuff question so

653
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,040
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> scratching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my head earlier and I</font>

654
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:50,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the answer now but the</font>

655
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,480
candidate on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper left has nothing</font>

656
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,440
to do with the candidate in the green

657
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,300
box exactly so a candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> no the item</font>

658
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,510
listed as ephemeral candidate is

659
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,130
basically I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> written some ephemeral</font>

660
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,780
configuration and waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to take</font>

661
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:08,490
effect so could you fully explain what

662
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:10,990
Dave candidate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top left is</font>

663
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:14,229
candidate top left so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to draw</font>

664
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:17,259
analogy to iOS XR or no juniper boxes

665
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,540
when you do edit config make a change

666
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to the point where you before you</font>

667
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,900
type commit so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

668
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,130
what you've changed you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

669
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,140
things you can see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you know</font>

670
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,890
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is the scratch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add before</font>

671
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:32,020
you write it out that's the candidate

672
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:34,569
either briskin are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

673
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,550
elaborate a little bit on the difference

674
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,670
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended config can apply that</font>

675
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:42,040
config but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular is it just a</font>

676
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:45,640
timing issue or maybe the sewer

677
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:49,150
basically decided to apply say most of

678
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,879
the intent intended configuration but

679
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,710
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them so it will be like a</font>

680
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,780
permanent difference between internet

681
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,980
and applied I will make my best attempt

682
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,770
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the points where</font>

683
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,360
you know the upper config guys have been

684
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,340
iterating with the net camp group trying

685
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get this stuff nailed down it's</font>

686
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,230
tricky they have obviously one thing in

687
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,020
mind and I TF is taking ty

688
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,660
sort of fully converge on it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

689
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:16,140
of my understanding it is exactly that

690
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">lately so I do make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know again sticking</font>

691
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:20,549
to a Juniper router is an example since

692
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,720
that's what I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I edit my config you</font>

693
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,540
know that would normally show up in the

694
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,000
canada config i type commit it moves to

695
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:28,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running data store that runnings</font>

696
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,300
datastore is now effectively the

697
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,799
intended configuration that will take

698
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,109
some amount of time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> percolate through</font>

699
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,840
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> come apply and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm about to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be corrected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think Jason's just one</font>

701
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,320

702
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing based so for example if an</font>

703
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,380
interface exists on the line card and

704
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,230
the line cards not physically plugged in

705
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,119
but you have pre configuration for it it

706
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,040
can be it can sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there forever so it's</font>

prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something that could</font>

711
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,720
actually exist at a later point in time

00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,190
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PI config you</font>

configuration that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended for the</font>

717
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:12,119
thing and then sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of at the bottom of</font>

718
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,880
the stack is<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we've actually done</font>

all this stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have the</font>

720
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,990
drive state now what is the operational

00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:27,470
things going on one more point for

722
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:31,729
clarification intended config and the

725
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,939
they come down together or can you

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,500
haven't if they come down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be</font>

727
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,180
ephemeral right it i thought the

00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,650
slaughter<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussions that we were having just</font>

730
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,640
before we left the room from that camp

731
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,410
and no<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Watson was suggesting to us</font>

732
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,710
that perhaps a better way to draw that

733
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:55,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">picture is that you know in the intended</font>

734
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:58,290
config of the device is probably closer

735
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,420
to the running<font color="#E5E5E5"> config which is coming</font>

736
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:03,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">from what we tended to call static</font>

737
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:05,910
configuration in hrs sense with the

738
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:08,100
ephemeral config applied to that as well

739
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:10,950
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> as overlay or override mechanism</font>

740
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:14,880
so we intended probably as the union<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

741
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:19,310
these two I if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I could do a good</font>

742
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,310
graphic I could show them overlay

743
00:43:20,229 --> 00:43:25,968
if you can do the graphic but but from

744
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,920
protocol point of view the arrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

745
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:29,989
goes down from there if the Intendant

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">config is all ready to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

747
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:34,160
the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just comes down as</font>

748
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:35,269
increment right so you know this

749
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,670
actually goes into something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

750
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:40,879
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> recall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being in the slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we</font>

751
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:43,549
actually have some yang that would grab

752
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,839
some yang later on but given that the

753
00:43:43,549 --> 00:43:47,449
meat of your question comes down to

754
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:49,249
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does the net com protocol</font>

755
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:51,920
operations or the net risk on photo

758
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,440
know we have examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the kinds of</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do in</font>

00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,690
of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's let's go back to the</font>

762
00:44:03,769 --> 00:44:08,689
diagram for a second since I think it

763
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,940
actually gives us things so let's ignore

764
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,859
for a second go the the deep details of

765
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,630
what that count for risk on forgot to

766
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:17,140
give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually before I go that down</font>

767
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,160
there bill did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a question well</font>

768
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,569
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should let you go down there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

769
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,368
still don't understand what ephemerals

770
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:25,130
to you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I I understood</font>

771
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:27,289
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said but there's still</font>

772
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,599
just one state like the it's not that

773
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:32,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal temperature is 72 in the in</font>

774
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,519
the room and the ephemerals temperature

775
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:38,328
is something else that that's the roomie

776
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:40,008
72 the desired temperature is different

777
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:42,920
between the intent of Keith Engel and

778
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:45,109
femoral config but the state there's

779
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,160
only one state state is what is

780
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:51,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now the derived state is</font>

781
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,910
only what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

782
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry if you go back like three slides</font>

783
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,899
there's something about state and

784
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,660
ephemeral state and that's what I'm not

785
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,029
kidding right here now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the</font>

786
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,788
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the blue box in the</font>

787
00:45:02,029 --> 00:45:06,170
upper right corner in an early slide and

788
00:45:04,789 --> 00:45:07,969
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if we probably</font>

789
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:14,089
should be calling at least one component

790
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:15,619
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> no ephemeral configuration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes</font>

791
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:18,650
if a real configuration if I'm real

792
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:21,140
state so when you write the yang yeah

793
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,619
when you write the yang you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

794
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:27,709
write the end just the way you write the

795
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:31,220
regular configuration except you use the

796
00:45:27,709 --> 00:45:33,618
word ephemeral so you have

797
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the femoral config that's that's a</font>

798
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:39,170
femoral config but in your config area

799
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,240
you can have notifications right when

800
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:43,220
you write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang there's a</font>

801
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,770
notification or you can have an RPC

802
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:48,439
operation or you can have operational

803
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:51,140
state actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I see where your</font>

804
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,700
question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going from so part of the</font>

805
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,250
problem here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to</font>

806
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:59,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actual yang for the thermometer</font>

807
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:01,040
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the the thing that is</font>

808
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:04,849
somewhat confusing here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provided</font>

809
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,009
an example no with a desired<font color="#E5E5E5"> state this</font>

810
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:09,500
is no piece of configuration and we have

811
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:12,140
no a piece of information that also say

812
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,340
what this thing actually is right now

813
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,379
that's what we see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the screen in</font>

814
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,780
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide has</font>

815
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:21,650
the ephemeral config part you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

816
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Unicode now difference like these can't</font>

817
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,760
work rule yeah we're looking for the one

818
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:28,070
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for configured from role</font>

819
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,260
which is your exam there we go so this

820
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">is what happens when we actually apply</font>

821
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to do if from roll type of stuff</font>

822
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,820
and we'll come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the full check</font>

823
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,550
you know conversation to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second this</font>

824
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,420
is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a data model that</font>

825
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:46,400
allows for static configuration to be

826
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,960
overlaid with a temporary value that

827
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,510
does not persist so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

828
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,349
it no this is why the thermostat model

829
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,060
sort of makes sense for a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

830
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:54,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're programming your thermostat</font>

831
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,480
at home you're going to set it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20c</font>

832
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,609
you're gonna be toast so it is level of

833
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,170
comfort and then you know somebody's

834
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:02,000
gonna say I'm too hot too cold they can

835
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:03,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonder or poke a couple buttons it's</font>

836
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,010
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take effect for a period of</font>

837
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,220
time and if the thermostat resets it

838
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:13,310
goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20c that state of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font>

839
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,439
in the temporary value that is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of</font>

840
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:19,180
you know these static configuration is

841
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:23,660
the ephemeral configuration state right

842
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:27,259
what's the ephemeral state ephemeral

843
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,029
operational state yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

844
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:31,010
where we start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that this example</font>

845
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:32,900
is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best example of that and</font>

846
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:34,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably why you're confused so</font>

847
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,580
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an example in a configuration</font>

848
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:39,680
schema where we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to override static</font>

849
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,990
things this is actually nice although

850
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,990
it's several I etfs back we did these

851
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,029
nice Venn diagrams about how no static

852
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,919
configuration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ephemeral</font>

853
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,470
configuration could be either fully

854
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,530
destroyed they never touch each other or

855
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:57,169
we may allow for some amount of

856
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:00,140
ephemeral configuration to override you

857
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:03,320
know these data configuration so in this

858
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,779
case we have no ephemeral configuration

859
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,880
state where the node that is the

860
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,710
operational state happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be shared</font>

861
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,690
obviously it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing that we're</font>

862
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:14,630
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at we want to know what the</font>

863
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:16,940
effective temperature actually is other

864
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:20,510
modules especially the ones that are

865
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:22,880
fully disjoint may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know for</font>

866
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">example a complete subtree know for like</font>

867
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,900
ephemeral static routes that do not

868
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,240
share the same schema as the system

869
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">static routes if that is a fully</font>

870
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:36,259
disjoint model in that case the

871
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,060
operational state is ephemeral it may

872
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,070
not either there may be no nodes there

873
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:42,009
whatsoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if the only container</font>

874
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:45,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">know is expected to be generally present</font>

875
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">its is it fully ephemeral basically if</font>

876
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,490
it's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> tagged as this is something</font>

877
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:53,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that only belongs when there's a fully</font>

878
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:58,490
ephemeral module another example<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

879
00:48:53,780 --> 00:49:02,420
be if you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ephemeral</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> addition of</font>

880
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:07,040
simply one bgb feature maybe your role

881
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:10,280
was a femoral feature and then when it

882
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,770
when you turned off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ephemeral you</font>

883
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:17,750
would not have the state related to the

884
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">rose if you know PHP Rose sure I I guess</font>

885
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:26,200
I get this you know the operational

886
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:29,840
state in relationship to a memorable

887
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:33,109
ephemeral config that is disjoint from

888
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:35,600
any other config I don't I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I</font>

889
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:40,250
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of labeling it separately</font>

890
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:42,350
but maybe I will that may uh bill I may

891
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,510
take it out for future things because it

892
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,210
seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have caused more configuration</font>

893
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:49,640
and more confusion than aided those are

894
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,290
just logical diagrams yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

895
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's confusing is that you</font>

896
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:56,029
know ephemeral state no it's just its

897
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:57,530
standard no config<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls as far as know</font>

898
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the consumers are</font>

899
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,240
concerned

900
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:02,490
the big difference is you know in terms

901
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,910
of labeling the stuff and making it

902
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:08,399
present in the yang model the model is

903
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:11,009
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire model is you know</font>

904
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,570
ephemeral true no there's no static

905
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:14,430
configuration see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not guaranteed to</font>

906
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:16,680
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> present on the system that's that's</font>

907
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:18,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">really the subtle difference questions</font>

908
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,669
please this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we want to walk</font>

909
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:24,900
through this target<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco a quick</font>

910
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:27,630
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a typo applied config</font>

911
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:30,450
years under config<font color="#E5E5E5"> faults on another</font>

912
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,640
side it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing under config true</font>

913
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:34,680
that is a title<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah we actually had</font>

914
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,109
slides on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday where that had been the</font>

915
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,930
case and defensively moving this is this

916
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:41,609
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct one and I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to</font>

917
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,549
stop at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one actually if this is the</font>

918
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:48,480
correct one then I have a question so

919
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:51,150
the applied config can be overwritten<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

920
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,369
ok so that's three the only none it's oh

921
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,020
that's confusing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is confusing that's</font>

922
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:56,910
why I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to get into the protocol</font>

923
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,650
level details so let's let's take any

924
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,089
questions there are not relevant to that

925
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,750
and then we can all hopefully that are

926
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:07,890
right that confusion comes from the joy

927
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:10,800
soft state debate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so related</font>

928
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:13,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a little bit see if if I have</font>

929
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,570
intended configuration which are missing

930
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:18,540
the parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is filled with</font>

931
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:21,330
template<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for example the</font>

932
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,070
template value default value<font color="#CCCCCC"> stem okay</font>

933
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,348
and it was missing so this then is it

934
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:27,990
going to intended config or<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied</font>

935
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:30,150
complete so in the case of default

936
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,339
values especially in the context of

937
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,670
ephemeral configuration that does not

938
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:37,830
overlap static configuration mm-hmm it's

939
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:41,099
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no different that the difference</font>

940
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:43,380
really being led different<font color="#E5E5E5"> default much</font>

941
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,960
like instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> a configuration only gets</font>

942
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:47,730
instantiated when a related<font color="#CCCCCC"> note it's</font>

943
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,680
not done so like you know for example a

944
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,290
leaf node that has got a default value

945
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,060
may only instantiate when the container

946
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,400
that contains it your AG leafless that

947
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,890
contains it becomes instantiated itself

948
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,180
so if you instantiate a ephemeral<font color="#CCCCCC"> isa</font>

949
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:06,960
configuration the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f the related default</font>

950
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:08,339
they also instantiate so so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

951
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,970
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you answered my question so</font>

952
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:15,390
is it intended for config or applied or

953
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">off okay so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I if let's say I just</font>

954
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:20,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">miss because I don't know it's a local</font>

955
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:22,410
policy issue what to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in the</font>

956
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,790
concept of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open config guys are</font>

957
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,129
looking for it is part of the intended

958
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">config and it may actually show up as a</font>

959
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:33,050
exclusive node in Indian is definitely a

960
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:35,640
show up as part of the operational state

961
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:37,380
there may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a note present in the</font>

962
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,810
configuration tree but it's effectively

963
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,400
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> portion of the</font>

964
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:44,640
configuration it's I did ephemeral stuff

965
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so basically its intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

966
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:51,118
and and the other question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that let's</font>

967
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:53,880
say I was asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 but because of</font>

968
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,580
like a local policy limitation I can go

969
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,170
up to nine is it possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

970
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,580
server will do line and it will be

971
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:02,910
applied configuration and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

972
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,859
different or it should reject the

973
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:06,480
configuration response as are you

974
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:08,790
getting validation and we're not there

975
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,880
yet yeah oh they're good question

976
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:15,509
questions it's her please please don't

977
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,970
forget that one with okay so show<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

978
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:19,890
hands again how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are now</font>

979
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:23,730
understanding this general model

980
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,859
hopefully more hands we're doing better

981
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:35,220
we're doing better how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

982
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:38,630
the people who don't understand it the

983
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:42,750
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are sure they understand it</font>

984
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:46,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so given this given what these</font>

985
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:48,540
things mean there are impacts on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

986
00:53:46,589 --> 00:53:50,279
com protocol and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest conf wrote of</font>

987
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:51,270
all is but stick mostly with net comp

988
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,190
because that's a slightly more

989
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,839
complicated version again the stuff

990
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,740
that's across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top are things that</font>

991
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,930
are netcom data stores and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

992
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:04,169
net com protocol was very much set up to

993
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:06,149
serve the net have data stores you do an

994
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,490

something that's an accord netcom

1027
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:23,049
expect is that if you do it edit config

1028
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:25,090
and a federal true note is not present

1029
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:27,760
as part of the relevant configuration

1030
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:31,900
tree no it shouldn't take effect it's

1031
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:36,780
probably a validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or some sort okay</font>

1032
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:43,120
go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look one more</font>

1035
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,609
you when you're acquiring a subtree what

1036
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:55,480
the configuration that actually is

1037
00:55:51,610 --> 00:55:56,860
running is it's actually they applied

1038
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,570
configuration sorry the intended

1039
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:01,410
configuration from the context of the

open config guides now mostly running

1041
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:06,460
but it's effectively know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1043
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:19,960

1044
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,030
that's actually it is down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue</font>

1055
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:46,880
also get config false notes now this is

outright operational state it doesn't

1060
00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:02,690
now able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a get that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will include</font>

1061
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:05,960
any how ephemeral<font color="#E5E5E5"> II instituted state</font>

1062
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:09,010
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be how they config so if</font>

1063
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:13,460
you're doing in the thermostat example a

1064
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:15,650
overlay of the intended temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1065
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,510
so you're sending it down to 18 c has

1066
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,650
your little bit chilly you're a little

1067
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:21,020
bit too when you want to cool down a

1068
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,119
little bit more no that's a temporary

1069
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:25,190
value you would expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the show up</font>

1070
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,530
in your get because you've actually done

00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,119
that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what is my intended</font>

1072
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,640
temperature right now it is no longer

1073
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,010
what the nose static configuration says

1074
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,350
it's funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be able to get the</font>

1075
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:38,840
18 there does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does that piece make</font>

1076
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:41,839
sense I'm saying some heads nodding

1077
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:44,359
those that's good same thing oops please

1078
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,950
go so just Jason CERN just a

1079
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:50,330
clarification question so you're saying

1080
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you do a get on on the node in the</font>

1081
00:57:50,330 --> 00:58:01,609
data model of desired temp a get will

1082
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,550
return the 72 degrees but I get config

1083
00:58:01,609 --> 00:58:06,680
would return the 80 from that same node

1084
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:08,960
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting there so if you do a</font>

1085
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:12,319
get config and which I hadn't actually

1086
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,900
gone to if you do a get you should get

1087
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,060
the configured ephemeral value because

1088
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,710
that's what's the applied one the system

1089
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,500
level your question goes into the next

1090
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:23,720
observation which is let me finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1091
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,310
other piece again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other piece of get</font>

1092
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,649
is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get any config false</font>

1093
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:29,000
notes that are present that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1094
00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:31,630
normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that doesn't change with</font>

1095
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,160
hrs the fact that something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ephemeral</font>

1098
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you said you're gonna get the</font>

1099
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:42,950
config false and you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

1100
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,919
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plight config I'm confused</font>

1101
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's under the config true</font>

1102
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:54,160
actually you get off

1103
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay get get you both configuration and</font>

1104
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,940
config fall state config good configure

1105
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:02,470
we get victory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the get</font>

1106
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,060
config and this is this is where we

1107
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,120
start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these subtleties know</font>

1108
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:09,100
so you know I'm and this is really where

1109
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:11,500
our discussion is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metcalfe know how</font>

1110
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:13,779
do we actually figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,180
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are overlays of some</font>

1112
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:18,700
sort we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

1113
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:23,080
thing do I really mean to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get when I do</font>

1114
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:25,419
get most user applications want to see

1115
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:30,190
you know for example what is by no

00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:46,810
things coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from do you know how do I</font>

1123
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:48,160
actually asked the system what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1124
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:49,330
actual static configuration that you're

1128
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:00,509
what does that return does it return the

static configuration which is running

1130

does it return no the ephemeral

specify a source no operation you could

say source running that is one hundred

1134
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:19,060

and fake you could say source ephemeral

1136
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:25,090
that is one hundred percent clear the

1137
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:28,270
thing that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really have is sort</font>

1138
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:30,640
of a logical view a union that says show

1139
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,930
me the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top in terms of</font>

1140
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:36,370
the configuration I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what the</font>

1141
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:40,060
config is worthy static and the

1142
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:41,710
ephemeral are interacting that operation

1143
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:43,660
is not a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is currently clear</font>

1144
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:45,640
and present in the net com protocol and

1145
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:47,259
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of our request to net</font>

1146
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">kompis how do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go about implementing</font>

1147
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,960
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason cerner another thought just</font>

1148
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,710
occurred to me that combination may also

1149
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:58,510
be not one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as the applied</font>

1150
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:00,370
bingo yeah and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the</font>

1151
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:02,170
interaction with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open config stuff</font>

1152
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:03,410
because we were talking about this

1153
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:05,000
ephemeral stuff before open

1154
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:07,879
they made our lives even more

1155
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,859
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we do have to reconcile</font>

1156
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,089
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big view and this is part</font>

1157
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:12,950
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look if you guys are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

1158
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:16,190
for what might be the protocol

1159
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,868
configuration changes the RPC changes to

1160
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:21,289
allow you to see each of these either

1161
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:22,549
logical views or operating use John

1162
01:01:21,289 --> 01:01:24,500
messenger don't want to get into a

1163
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:26,660
debate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but it just seems to</font>

1164
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">me that you should be having this</font>

1165
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:32,899
discussion not in here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all but only</font>

1166
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:34,520
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> code ah so the reason why we're</font>

1167
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,950
actually having this discussion here is

1168
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,690
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask any three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1169
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,250
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside a net conf note for help</font>

1170
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:43,210
on this there would be get slightly

1171
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:46,099
three different answers no this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1172
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:47,809
now we now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now so the part of</font>

1173
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:49,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goal of this session here</font>

1174
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:51,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we've had these discussions</font>

1175
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,170
several times with the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and netcom</font>

1176
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:57,308
is to get majority the art urs working

1177
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:59,619
group behind you what the ideas mean

1178
01:01:57,309 --> 01:02:01,880
that's not fuss over what the

1179
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:03,650
terminology is in terms of the

1180
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,740
functional component so what are the

1181
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:08,809
functional requirements understanding

1182
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:10,160
the functional requirements let's refine

1183
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:12,349
the functional requirements so they can

1184
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,750
be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> against what net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conf is</font>

1185
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:17,680
providing in their protocol inside of

1186
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,609
their RPC operations and inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1187
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,859
interaction Natalie with ephemeral

1188
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:24,098
config and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Static config but also the</font>

1189
01:02:21,859 --> 01:02:29,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland config operational state stuff</font>

1190
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:32,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ants are both approach toward</font>

1191
01:02:29,049 --> 01:02:35,240
operational code running code then rough

1192
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:37,339
consensus so again it was like the

1193
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:40,069
protocol operations in dec calm not

1194
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:43,690
really hard but the trouble is no we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1195
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:47,538
have strong context of when you do a get

1196
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:49,700
gets normally give you config plus know

1197
01:02:47,539 --> 01:02:52,609
your operational state now you can fake

1198
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:55,160
fall stuff maybe we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

1199
01:02:52,609 --> 01:02:56,990
filter attached to get this is one of

1200
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that the ephemeral protocol</font>

1201
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:00,529
requirements document that we put

1202
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">together for to help to try to help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nick</font>

1203
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:08,680
have understand this maybe sometimes we

1204
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:11,630
going to get the actual state that was

1205
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,980
present and configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

1206
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,270
retrieve the fact that this was 20

1207
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:16,400
because get can give you the running

1208
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,180
state as well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to get only</font>

1209
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,609
the ephemeral

1210
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:21,680
pieces of configuration and one of the

1211
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:23,990
requests from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app the open config</font>

1212
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,720
guys for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the app state stuff I want to</font>

1213
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:29,868
be able to get the intended versus the

1214
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:33,290
actor I've state<font color="#CCCCCC"> no it intended apply</font>

1215
01:03:29,869 --> 01:03:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">your I've you know the sort of lag</font>

1216
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:36,050
between these four different things or

1217
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,259
the fact that you may have like no an

1218
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:41,540
interface configured duplex or you may

1219
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:43,309
have interface configured auto you want

1220
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,630
to see what it actually is there are

1221
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,740
three things here that you might want to

1222
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,540
get right you might want to get the

1223
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:50,868
light blue box or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green box or the</font>

1224
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:52,450
dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue box exactly okay um the next</font>

1225
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:55,579
session<font color="#CCCCCC"> starts in seven minutes I'm</font>

1226
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:57,500
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say this is a great discussion</font>

1227
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:59,569
I love that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're having it but I think</font>

1228
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:02,420
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be out of time I think we are</font>

1229
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:04,550
at a time but more importantly again for

1230
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:07,430
the room do you feel like you understand

1231
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:11,450
why this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusing and you know it</font>

1232
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:13,250
more importantly young and now but do

1233
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:15,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">you also have hopefully a feeling for</font>

1234
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,390
what the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved are the</font>

1235
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,400
functional components and why the

1236
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:23,629
existing operations that are available

1237
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:25,099
in the protocols are not fully extended

1238
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,410
for the you know the cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> to retrieve</font>

1239
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:36,799
these different versions of the

1240
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:38,660
information again remember this is that

1241
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:42,200
conf and this was their data store name

1242
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:43,700
go blame them thank thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1243
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,250
attending and thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1244
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions more us the better we can</font>

1245
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,650
write examples in the document

1246
01:04:48,500 --> 01:05:01,579
appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bill and everyone else</font>

1247
01:04:50,650 --> 01:05:03,410
thank you Jason so I actually know that

1248
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:05,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last item here is if you think you</font>

1249
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:07,759
understand it now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us work on</font>

1250
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS documents get them out and</font>

1251
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,940
published and then say we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1252
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:14,598
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this ever again until</font>

1253
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:17,500
netcom actually gives us something we

1254
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:17,500
have cool models will work on

1255
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:26,170
here I I am
