a couple people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to help us</font>

10
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,290
collaboratively take minutes it's easier

11
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,390
more than one of you helps and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

12
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,630
easy to know just add things here and

nothing else would you please check if

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,500
you spoke at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic to make sure your</font>

16
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,680
name was being spelled right that would

do that much thank you

19
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,180
so we have a an agenda that short but I

20
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,000
have a feeling we're going to have a

21
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,860
discussion that's long so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,720
thing we'll do is we'll walk through

23
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,150
this agenda and if you want to add

24
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,580
something if you have some draft you

25
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,480
want to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me about it the last minute</font>

26
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,010
please do we'll have the chair slides

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,260
which will probably catch us up on the

28
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:53,530
10 after and then we'll have a hackathon

29
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:55,329
a update if you participated in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS</font>

30
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,170
team at the hackathon please raise your

31
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:01,750
hand see we had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

32
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,780
are working at the hackathon so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

33
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,780
give an update on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two parts will go</font>

34
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,900
through a quick QA on the data models

35
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,700
and tell you what's next and then we'll

36
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,250
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two documents the</font>

37
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,399
requirements for management flow one

38
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,668
last requirement document that we need

39
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,429
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send over to along with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font>

40
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the package</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to netcom and then we'll go</font>

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,390
through the protocol straw man and you

42
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,870
notice we have a good solid hour to talk

43
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:36,400
about it the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation will take</font>

44
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:38,620
us much less<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20-25</font>

45
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,520
minutes and it's meant to have a lot of

46
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,390
discussion and Q&A<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that we'll</font>

47
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,780
go ahead any questions or changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,780
thank you

49
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:11,870
okay first of all Jeff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I met as we</font>

50
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:16,750
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the ITF week to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

51
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:20,479
goals because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 s's a creation of a</font>

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:24,050
protocol interface and we've been really

53
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,508
go oriented in 2015 and I had thought

54
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,180
we'd be through a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ISSG</font>

55
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:33,229
process by now but we're resetting our

56
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,199
goals so our version<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is to send to</font>

57
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg all our requirements by May 5th</font>

58
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,720
the one requirements remaining are the

59
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,300
ephemeral state which requires us to do

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,500
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on the protocol straw man and</font>

61
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:51,219
this management<font color="#E5E5E5"> data flow and then</font>

62
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:54,110
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll work with the net come</font>

63
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:57,650
to at least get an initial protocol idea

64
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,469
by July and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on a hackathon and</font>

65
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,710
the hackathons have been very useful so

66
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:05,539
we'll be going through that and by July

67
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,489
I think we'll have enough experience

68
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:10,130
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our protocol independent data</font>

69
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,680
models to send most of them the topology

70
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,650
data model has been out and being used

71
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,440
for a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

72
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,900
right about a year and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half the rib</font>

73
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,169
data model will hope to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some code</font>

74
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,620
and open<font color="#CCCCCC"> sourcing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the ITF s</font>

75
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:29,990
and the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> based rib we hope to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

76
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,990
the same thing in open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and then</font>

77
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,080
we'd like to ask for design team rusts

78
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:40,130
let off a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting discussion</font>

79
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,080
after the November ITF on multiple

80
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:44,900
priorities and priority heads I want to

81
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,349
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to pick up a design team in</font>

82
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,580
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay approved is RFC's</font>

83
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:54,770
we finally got our first to<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC CA and</font>

84
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,469
we have three requirements at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg</font>

85
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,960
the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements is a maybe</font>

86
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:03,680
going within a day or so so I included

87
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,989
that we have the two requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

88
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
mentioned and we just need to finalize

89
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,490
things oh by the way if you haven't

90
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,830
commented on the protocol security

91
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,769
environments requirements if you would

92
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,568
take a moment to do that

93
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:20,089
what we found in our first review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

94
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:23,029
architecture is they really wanted us to

95
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:24,979
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this new environment the</font>

96
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:28,159
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Miguel wrote a very</font>

97
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,199
nice document if you would just try to

98
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into security if</font>

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:35,209
not we'll go find some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

100
00:07:32,929 --> 00:07:37,578
the security environment the security

101
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:40,579
environment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a protocol but the</font>

102
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:43,189
the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol lives in so</font>

103
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:45,799
if you're running I<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2's on a router or</font>

104
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:48,319
on a device this tells you what security

105
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:52,849
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be concerned with on that</font>

106
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:57,969
device I think I've gone through the

107
00:07:52,849 --> 00:08:02,149
rest of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we may give some</font>

108
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:05,748
start to people doing our truest models

109
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:08,119
for other protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and i do want</font>

110
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to list the interims you know we have a</font>

111
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:14,209
practice of interims to have that deep

112
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:18,619
discussion will have an interim on the

113
00:08:14,209 --> 00:08:21,349
427 518 you can read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the idea is</font>

114
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:23,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the last pieces of</font>

115
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:26,179
the protocols strawman and get to the

116
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:35,680
hackathon with a good solid

117
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:39,169
implementations is a mid here today I

118
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:42,039
haven't seen him but if he Joel have you

119
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:45,309
is he here did he<font color="#E5E5E5"> not come and make it</font>

120
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I he said he was going to try but</font>

121
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:58,059
it's a long way<font color="#CCCCCC"> find the clicker just a</font>

122
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,059
minute for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technical change</font>

123
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:24,689
do you want to go first or shall I your

124
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:32,810
choices oh I'm tired of talking it's

125
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:52,500
your turn right should be fine I think

126
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:57,930
no today Japan actually yes they're ugly

127
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:01,920
oh yes all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um I just tell you what</font>

129
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,449
void I'm presenting the results of the

130
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,820
hackathon that we did on the pub sub

131
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:13,650
implementation that was in open daylight

132
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:17,520
Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the signal yeah so at the</font>

133
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:19,319
at the hackathon we had a desire to add

134
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,380
more code to the opendaylight

135
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,090
implementation of yang push and push

136
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,670
currently in open daylight is able to

137
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a subscription from open daylight</font>

138
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:33,660
on to a network element in this case an

139
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:36,630
XR box most of the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ambika Tripathi who's coming with me</font>

141
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:43,740
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and I got some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help from ye</font>

142
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:45,750
from lead from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia and doing some</font>

143
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,200
the net cough notification stuff next

144
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,720
slide there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really two things that</font>

145
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,730
we're trying to present first thing was

146
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,270
that we had a client implementation that

147
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,140
could be extended with delete

148
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,430
subscription code if we can create a

149
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,040
soul subscription it's good we can

150
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,739
delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the second thing we want</font>

151
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,630
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had a router that</font>

152
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,270
was able to handle change subscription

153
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">are say a description and delete</font>

154
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,010
subscription and we showed that third

155
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,140
thing is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

156
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the IETF draft yang push that's</font>

157
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,490
being driven in the net cough working

158
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,900
group and we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and the last thing</font>

159
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show that we</font>

160
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,550
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use net come as a transport and</font>

161
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,030
connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly in VA terminal session</font>

162
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,500
and

163
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,520
let some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these commands for create</font>

164
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:35,160
and delete subscription also work across

165
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">netcom and we we did that if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,709
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up you can see a terminal where</font>

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,829
we have rest api is going from yang push

168
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,890
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opendaylight down through a</font>

169
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,360
subscriber a yang push subscriber that

170
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,760
goes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service abstraction layer</font>

171
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,160
and down to an XR box on the bottom you

172
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">see three sets of information and yang</font>

173
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,860
models we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to create and delete</font>

174
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,060
subscriptions for interface state<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

175
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,790
other words we're allowed to create

176
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,130
interface going up and down we're able

177
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,620
to create and delete an interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> sre a</font>

178
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,270
a CL so you could do config change and

179
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,060
watch the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACLS be changed on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the box and</font>

180
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:18,150
finally we did routes were able to outer

181
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,219
add a route to the box and watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave</font>

182
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,439
Ralph information be pushed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did</font>

183
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,260
add and delete subscriptions for three

184
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,270
types and we also were able to do and

185
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,730
show it via net comp directly without

186
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:34,020
having to go through up in daylight as a

187
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:37,500
as a as an intermediary so both were

188
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:40,949
both were shown and let's talk a little

189
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:43,680
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that next slide so as I</font>

190
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:47,900
mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of making</font>

191
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,489
the the delete subscription work

192
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,189
opendaylight had only periodic

193
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,530
subscriptions available however<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

194
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,560
demo and in the hackathon we were able

195
00:12:55,530 --> 00:13:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do not just a periodic subscription</font>

196
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,140
we also got working an unchanged

197
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:08,430
subscription where we get information

198
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,650
sent from the XR a box as something is

199
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,780
changing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network element itself</font>

200
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,910
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do create and delete</font>

201
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,319
subscriptions for periodic and on change

202
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:21,270
for selected data on the on the device

203
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,190
this code that has been developed as

204
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:26,370
going to go into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next release of</font>

205
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:29,760
open daylight in boron and if anybody

206
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,130
wants to see the demos or see the code

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at bits and bytes on</font>

208
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,680
Thursday in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands on</font>

209
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:41,360
and watch these things running that's it

210
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,359
any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions or any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

211
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,260
so effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> pub/sub implementation</font>

212
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:51,390
based on the ankush draft in the net

213
00:13:49,260 --> 00:14:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">comp working group with periodic and</font>

214
00:13:51,390 --> 00:14:14,220
unchanged data into a network element so

215
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:21,330
I was is this are you hearing good so I

216
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:24,360
was working with the with we had Eric

217
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:28,200
doing one and then we planned uh to work

218
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,300
on an environment that Edwin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Go Daddy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,870
did I pronounce that right if you're

220
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:39,000
more Spanish and enabled than I am uh

221
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:41,700
and he sent a tutorial and he sent a vm

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,260
and what we discovered is the vm was a

223
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:49,680
little bit heavy for our laptops and

224
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,920
then we hope to load<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS data models</font>

225
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:57,839
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OTL library and connect well</font>

226
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:01,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">after we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the it was a little</font>

227
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,720
heavy to get this<font color="#CCCCCC"> edwin's development</font>

228
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,800
environment by the way I should take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

229
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,850
step back the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edwin send us a</font>

230
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,020
development environment is one of the

231
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:15,750
problems we had in hackathon 80 ITF 94

232
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:21,030
is it was very difficult for us to set

233
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:24,840
up the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

234
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:28,920
found is that between lithium and

235
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:31,380
beryllium did I pronounce that right odl

236
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,650
had really improved it set up so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took</font>

237
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:37,680
me maybe half an hour to download the

238
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,569
ubuntu and download the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OTL suddenly I</font>

239
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,890
had the environment we couldn't set up

240
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:46,020
with with him so ah that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edwin had</font>

241
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:51,540
taken his work he had set up that and

242
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:54,420
min net and min exit so but it kept

243
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,430
having too much memory requirements

244
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,680
our laptop so we took the second goal

245
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,138
which was to hack together an i er to

246
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,349
his client and server and get an hour to

247
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:08,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">his route add working so uh these are</font>

248
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:12,410
the people who helped us Sudan Jason

249
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:15,139
Lucy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mamadou and we broke into teams and</font>

250
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">stand up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mama do momma Dee was our first</font>

251
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:23,100
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time a participant in</font>

252
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ITF and he joined this bravely at</font>

253
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,170
hackathon within his first couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

254
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he actually helped us get the</font>

255
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,519
environment up so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thank you</font>

256
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:37,139
to him and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the others</font>

258
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:42,209
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> more new participants will wander</font>

259
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,069
in and give us some help we then set up

260
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">at a development environment with you</font>

261
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:55,440
bunt to a 4-3 and min net and on a set

262
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,660
of laptops and Don and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mahmoud who did</font>

263
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,829
that and got it up and going once they

264
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:04,799
worked out a few bugs in virtualbox and

265
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:10,049
then I in Anna and Jason looked at

266
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:15,569
loading gang CLI pro quagga and tail FD

267
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:19,109
together and we got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Yuma where's</font>

268
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:24,329
our Yuma we got the Yuma pro loaded up

269
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:26,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gang model and then we were trying</font>

270
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,909
to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two are then next step</font>

271
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,679
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get quokka to talk to Taylor and</font>

272
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:37,200
after we work to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while we found</font>

273
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,870
that this was the commercial variant

274
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,450
that tail F actually sells is a Quadra

275
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:47,100
installation so that was probably pretty

276
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:50,160
good we did get at least the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two coffee</font>

277
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">and yang pro up it was fairly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

278
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,320
use both you just unload them their

279
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,140
command lines are easy to work thank you

280
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,240
Andy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ax and humor works for having a</font>

lovely yang<font color="#CCCCCC"> pros gang CLI pro for us and</font>

282
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,370
comfy was really easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> unload and</font>

complete it and send it out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

287
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">source or audio so we made a good</font>

288
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,340
beginning this was essentially maybe

289
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,610
four or five hours which tells you how

290
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:34,559
far we've come in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple months</font>

291
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:40,709
questions and anyone else this is good

292
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:43,050
toy code<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um I think I got through</font>

293
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:47,929
everything air anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

294
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,928
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the team good</font>

295
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I have the next presentation</font>

296
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">because in as the chair tried to bundle</font>

297
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:14,529
up all the requirements that everyone

298
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:17,469
else is done and send them off to the

299
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:20,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">isg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I found a hole so I need your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help</font>

300
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:23,529
to sort of finish this off and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

301
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:25,359
ship them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay or at least when we</font>

302
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,879
didn't know about now one of the things

303
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,340
we talked about in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture is</font>

304
00:19:27,879 --> 00:19:32,199
that we would not only have a

305
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,509
configuration and invent channel that we

306
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,669
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other data flow</font>

307
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:41,229
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I took as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chair</font>

308
00:19:38,669 --> 00:19:44,320
and this is sort of a Chairs draft

309
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:46,960
trying to clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and put a bow tie</font>

310
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,460
around all the requirements I looked at

311
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,859
the use use case summary and Joel

312
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,919
carefully pointed to me that that's a

313
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:59,408
sort of old draft and this is a plea if

314
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,339
you could read that and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

315
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:05,080
still reasonable but I looked at this

316
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:07,450
draft and I looked at all the data flow

317
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,908
requirements and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> having done</font>

318
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,580
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else I sort of compiled a</font>

319
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:15,309
list of requirements it would have said

320
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,070
now i am not saying these are

321
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,139
requirements we need to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

322
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,299
something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and can</font>

323
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:25,478
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> include them in the requirements</font>

324
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:28,418
there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple taking my chair head</font>

325
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:31,179
off that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to see us consider</font>

326
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:33,009
like what happens if we're doing a

327
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:35,649
management channel in the middle of a

328
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:38,889
denial<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service attack do we want to</font>

329
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:43,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to do something special I would like</font>

330
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:48,998
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to in my personal hat see what we</font>

331
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:53,229
can do about validation do we do always

332
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:56,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">do netcom style validation or do we do</font>

333
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:58,989
maybe less to make faster or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

334
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:01,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">at all and there are implementations</font>

335
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:03,549
which are doing all free so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me start</font>

336
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:05,799
with this and at the end of each one I'm

337
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,289
going to go does anybody think we really

338
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,299
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this in will make the same</font>

339
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:15,580
call on the list but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly</font>

340
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:17,770
short turn okay the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

341
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,320
on this uh

342
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,210
of checks and it's one that having

343
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,909
talked to three different implementation

344
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:27,790
people are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like five or</font>

345
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,730
six there are several ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it the</font>

346
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:34,090
one is minimal data reception checks are

347
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:36,790
the tlv valid on the wire and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you assume</font>

348
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,939
the client has done something useful now

349
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:43,810
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can shoot yourself</font>

350
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,570
in the foot by having bad data and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ND</font>

351
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:49,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">as Andy will tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you get bad data</font>

352
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,149
in the data store life is just really

353
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,129
bad it stays bad likely but there are

354
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,620
some implementations which do enough

355
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,020
checking and they want enough speak on

356
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:02,139
routes that they would like this the

357
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,540
next one is non referential cheats don't

358
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:08,410
do leaf<font color="#CCCCCC"> referee once don't do instance</font>

359
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:10,540
identifier and that's medium ground was

360
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,670
sort of suggested as a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speed</font>

361
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:17,139
things up and the next one is full

362
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:21,120
checks now does anybody have an opinion

363
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,120
and like to discuss it at the mic is

364
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">there anybody who's done enough</font>

365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:36,639
implementation to say some something

366
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:39,870
about this requirement I Andy Berman

367
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:44,520
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very server centric approach</font>

368
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:46,959
what does this give the client developer

369
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,680
is trying to write code it works on

370
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,750
multiple boxes it gives them no

371
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,600
confidence that the gang is actually

372
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:58,750
implemented so it really diminishes the

373
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,290
value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang as as describing the</font>

374
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:05,730
constraints also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> note that</font>

375
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:08,170
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine-readable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> constraints are</font>

376
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,660
optional you could put all your

377
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,160
constraints in the description clause so

378
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,980
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say well we're not</font>

379
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,820
ignoring the description<font color="#E5E5E5"> clause</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two I</font>

380
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,600
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read I don't need to</font>

381
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:22,360
enforce that so my concern here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

382
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:26,110
it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> really low value to the</font>

383
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:29,840
client developer to not know that the

384
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:32,750
yang contract is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be honored</font>

385
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,899
you know based on arbitrary things like

386
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaf ref statement because I could put</font>

387
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,190
the requirement for leaf ref in the

388
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:46,100
description claws instead so this is is

389
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a simplistic view of how things</font>

390
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,139
and you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also goes to well I</font>

391
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,700
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client and no client is ever</font>

392
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:59,600
going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack me in an exploit</font>

393
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:03,740
information or you know set up a path to

394
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to send a you know privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leak privacy</font>

395
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:11,330
data so the in the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's going to</font>

396
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise security guys some interest if you</font>

397
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:18,020
tell them you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this I</font>

398
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,590
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think ah I am well aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font>

399
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,539
raising<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security guys interests so I</font>

400
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:26,270
have had people who are doing

401
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:28,720
implementations do all three I'm glad

402
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:31,940
and he's here to represent the full

403
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,480
validation but this is one in your

404
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,909
chairs hat off personal opinion we

405
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,880
really have people doing it three ways

406
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I don't want to break it but the</font>

407
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of least resistance is the full</font>

408
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,649
checks and we can do that and say it's

409
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:54,830
too busy anyone else want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

410
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:58,879
comment on this hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're cheers thank</font>

411
00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:00,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">you there are chairs over here we can</font>

412
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have people move in if you're if you</font>

413
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:08,928
want to sit if you want to stand like me

414
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:12,320
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea the second one there</font>

415
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a requirement right now that come and</font>

416
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:20,500
please correct me if I'm wrong can do

417
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:24,080
both xml and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason as far as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form oh</font>

418
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:28,460
but but there's a press conf into<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

419
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:32,090
and Jason thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I'll</font>

420
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,220
correct the slides I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

421
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,309
anybody really needs anything more than

422
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,490
this at this time but that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

423
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the requirements is to be able to do</font>

424
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:47,299
data fat formats<font color="#CCCCCC"> or beyond that</font>

425
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:50,659
and a ski excuse me patrol<font color="#E5E5E5"> halpern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

426
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,879
what I saw was there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quiet use</font>

427
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,860
case which suggested that some people

428
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,200
wanted that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early stages of our</font>

429
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,360
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I correct think that given</font>

430
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,230
where we've gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> this requirement is</font>

431
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:07,039
justify agree with you a hundred percent

432
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:09,559
so jeff has so the four large data

433
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,640
transfers we have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a minimum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

434
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:16,190
implement so our<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML in rest calm for</font>

435
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,230
netcom is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a minimum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement since</font>

436
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,720
that covers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current common ITF</font>

437
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,370
toolchain at some later point in time we

438
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,320
may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have specific applications</font>

439
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,939
that aren't that but we have to start

440
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:32,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">with one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so unless someone really</font>

441
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:35,360
that was everybody agreeing on on XML or

442
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:38,559
XML and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason for risk up okay that's</font>

443
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:44,350
close this chair is about closing issues

444
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,350
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is due go ahead it</font>

445
00:26:46,149 --> 00:26:51,709
can't Watson so the large data transfers

446
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,080
that for on the control side of things

447
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,480
or on the telemetry data acquisition

448
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:03,260
side of things right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">one thread coming out you'll see the</font>

450
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,480
answer right now at this point in the

451
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:10,220
question would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be yes and yes right now</font>

452
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,419
under net conf I can't imagine doing

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,950
anything other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than accept xml I'll just</font>

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,740
so nice thing if I said thread I'm sorry

Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

475
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:19,490
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked at net mod and that is how</font>

476
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,070
would we integrate with the protobuf and

477
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,320
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not necessarily</font>

478
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,000
ietf standards specs so we have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

479
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,918
desire to it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly</font>

480
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,450
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that binding is there any</font>

481
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,679
thought people have on that so it's just

482
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,200
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter of you know how you were</font>

483
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,179
serialize your data so if you're using

484
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the google proto buffs you will get also</font>

485
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:44,600
the RPCs and in this case so sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

486
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,639
correct myself so you know with the

487
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,010
proto buffs you can just utilize the

488
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,840
data and then you can you know map them

489
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:53,330
into for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's allometric they</font>

490
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,439
they can map them into your RPC that you

491
00:28:53,330 --> 00:29:00,379
have in yang so you know go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead I'm</font>

492
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,320
sorry yes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make proto BOTS work</font>

493
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,440
that's not a question the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

494
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,720
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to standardize and for</font>

495
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,210
now what we have agreed to standardize

496
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,919
this XML and JSON and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not go into</font>

497
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,809
what are all the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and how</font>

498
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">would we make them work because that's</font>

499
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:19,879
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question on the table for us</font>

500
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:21,200
well I do have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support Joel no we</font>

501
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,910
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start with the mandatory</font>

502
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,820
diplomats basically just because we need

503
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:28,220
to make progress that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you give</font>

504
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,379
an outside of I hrs there is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

505
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,210
demand for this type of telemetry the

506
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,910
right places for that no standardization

507
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,610
work for translating yang models into

508
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:40,040
other formats and other transports is

509
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:42,020
work that probably belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> net Matt and</font>

510
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a you will have a comment</font>

511
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:47,720
a question about IP figs next so let's

512
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,360
well no I would still need us say that

513
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,220
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a super super like</font>

514
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,379
you can essentially negotiate the

515
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,950
transport that you should be also you

516
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:00,440
know negotiate a data format between you

517
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,510
know the client and the between the

518
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,190
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agent so for for somewhat</font>

519
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,020
strange reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put in</font>

520
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:09,560
transport type is one of the selectors

521
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:13,500
inside of up sub yeah

522
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:18,740
so then just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

523
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:21,810
select<font color="#CCCCCC"> different transports or choose</font>

524
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,660
I'm saying you know different data

525
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:26,429
formats different data for<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah they did</font>

526
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,380
you can negotiate on data formats you

527
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:29,790
can operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you can offer these</font>

528
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,530
are the data formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their support</font>

529
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then you know you can then I'll</font>

530
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:36,930
private on you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> access it my</font>

531
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:39,030
second both both points there it is

532
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,350
certainly possible to protobuf and I did

533
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,060
talk to some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the BBF</font>

534
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:47,990
yesterday and they are looking at IP fix

535
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:51,360
to support um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

536
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:54,570
still on still under idea actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh um</font>

537
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,110
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did a draft a while back and had</font>

538
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:02,030
a proposal for negotiating the encoding

539
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:05,010
there's a natural point in the net conf

540
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:07,110
in between the hollow and the first RPC

541
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:09,750
where they have to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the framing</font>

542
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:12,510
anyways right there you can negotiate

543
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:16,770
anything you want as far as the you know

544
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:19,290
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xml or I'll take JSON</font>

545
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:21,510
and this guy says all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do JSON then the</font>

546
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,930
way it matches you go Jason's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the match</font>

547
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,120
so you could just add protobuf some and

548
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,530
whatever and i think i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said this</font>

549
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,659
on the mailing list too but i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

550
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,570
to see like yang push kind of define

551
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:36,090
this and and liar to RSS using so

552
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:37,980
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it it's not our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job to</font>

553
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,060
specifically design the protocol

554
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,070
components we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing</font>

555
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:45,629
requirements and hoping they end up

556
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:51,120
generally useful so for this first first

557
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:53,940
version of our I tres should we include

558
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,360
something as a choice that can be

559
00:31:53,940 --> 00:32:01,490
negotiated beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jason and that</font>

560
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,020
was protobuf just<font color="#E5E5E5"> xml and jason i think</font>

561
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,310
what we have to worry about to start

562
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,780
with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's are going to be our</font>

563
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,210
job to have a mandatory to implement

564
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,770
because that's what we're doing but we

565
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,570
should have the flexibility this is what

566
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,340
we're seeing in pub sub to allow for

567
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,790
selectors for other formats at later

568
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,159
dates so for the first version<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am you</font>

569
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,020
know just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead with XML and JSON</font>

570
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,980
is fine with version lunches together

571
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,990
standardized

572
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,820
and adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> their like future flexibility</font>

573
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:28,919
in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fallout Persians that's</font>

574
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,470
you know the from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my perspective</font>

575
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:32,970
this works<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so much the future</font>

576
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,770
versions the selector is going to be in

577
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,419
there from day one it's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

578
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,940
thing that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a option in this</font>

579
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:43,500
lecture from day one is there the

580
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:47,570
mandatory implements<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um I think we</font>

581
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:51,870
took care of two and three all at once

582
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:55,309
so I'll just I've got it sorry oh no

583
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:58,850
that's fine well there<font color="#CCCCCC"> must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a four</font>

584
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is where we get to the IP fix</font>

585
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:04,428
should we in the first version and I

586
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:08,669
will call it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first version allow</font>

587
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:11,429
IP fixes one of them is anybody want IP

588
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:13,980
fix in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first version Joel you know</font>

589
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:17,220
my personal opinion on this is no so and

590
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,549
your opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is know if you wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

591
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,130
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down we've had this debate in case I</font>

592
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:26,040
know your answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no does anybody's</font>

593
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,380
answer yes for IP fix for the first one

594
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,120
Eric do they do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who are</font>

595
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,970
using IP fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it in the first</font>

596
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:42,270
version of I to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font>

597
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:45,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to okay so till I get more input</font>

598
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,370
from them no but know that it could come

599
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,950
so i guess i<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frame it that way i'm</font>

600
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:54,629
good to hear that they're trying it that

601
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:57,480
was in the specification and that's the

602
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:02,040
two of four and<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is can you send it</font>

603
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:06,870
and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose it okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

604
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:09,300
have should we be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a data</font>

605
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:12,449
traffic that scales up and scales down

606
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,669
in some sense the push applications has

607
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,918
the ability to scale subscriptions up

608
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,350
and down but should we be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in</font>

609
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,830
the protocol something that says oh yes

610
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:25,889
if you're doing a memory processing time

611
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:28,889
or upon flow we have this rate now this

612
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:32,429
could even be a gang model for the the

613
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:33,810
IRS but that's one of the things anybody

614
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,080
feel like it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

615
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">version</font>

616
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,480
you need the rest resource monitoring

617
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">damn bug on each need research</font>

618
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,679
monitoring because otherwise you might

619
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,759
send down from you know from you will

620
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,469
receive from multiple clients

621
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,720
conflicting requesting they will try to

622
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:53,020
execute them you know run into a race in

623
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:57,009
the race issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a yes from</font>

624
00:34:53,020 --> 00:35:00,340
an implementer it's usually is my gold

625
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:03,550
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we'll do yes anybody</font>

626
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:07,870
object to yes I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

627
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:11,380
closing off ideas so your chairs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

628
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:13,930
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one do you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

629
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:20,200
be able to interact with OEM functions

630
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:22,710
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first version easily so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

631
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ask for a clarification this is Jeff</font>

632
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:29,430
do you mean should we have as core data

633
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:32,800
models that actually interact with Oh am

634
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,649
yes should we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> core data models and</font>

635
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,530
should we be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass the necessary</font>

636
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,870
information so for resource monitoring

637
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:44,620
you need om interactions because you

638
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:46,540
know but the data models for OEMs are

639
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,339
not finished but we have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

640
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the account because if you want to do</font>

641
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,930
resource monitoring you need yo am

642
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:55,450
information all right and i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

643
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:59,140
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a scanner clarifying question</font>

644
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:01,770
do we mean actually a nitrous oam module

645
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,940
or is this a request to actually have

646
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:11,860
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh am in the room or lime sense</font>

647
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:13,300
um do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something before I</font>

648
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,710
answer that or do you want to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> love</font>

649
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">me and try phrasing the question a</font>

650
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,740
little differently<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Jeff if this</font>

651
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't address your question you can</font>

652
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,500
bring yours back up there's two very

653
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:25,089
different notions for interact with<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM</font>

654
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,330
one is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to observe the results</font>

655
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:30,910
of connectivity checks and opinions and

656
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:33,700
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are started by</font>

657
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:36,089
whatever that's an interaction with<font color="#E5E5E5"> oam</font>

658
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,370
and one that makes perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

659
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:42,700
the other is having mechanisms mean I to

660
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:45,370
RS to trigger all of the myriad oam

661
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:49,089
things that go on and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes me</font>

662
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,680
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nervous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> p1 and so you use the</font>

663
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,829
word into

664
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,140
as I discussed with you on the call one

665
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:56,520
raining I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with the other</font>

666
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,650
meaning makes me really uncomfortable

667
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,420
and that's why I left at this fake

668
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,980
because we need to have Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Joel</font>

669
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,309
for standing up and being my friend

670
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,470
lease treatment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I would maybe</font>

671
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:10,740
restate this then that we would allow

672
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:15,240
hrs to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the OEM mechanisms</font>

673
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:17,790
used to to see information<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back</font>

674
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,950
for the resource management and for

675
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:23,609
other things but not in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

676
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:27,029
version there was mpls uh use cases

677
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:29,098
which acts to trigger some of the OEM

678
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,380
functions and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little advanced</font>

679
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:35,220
for my first one once we get some

680
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:38,609
example code we might be doing fine hey

681
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,618
I hope someone i hope this recording is

682
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:49,619
really working because i will listen to

683
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:55,170
it carefully as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think</font>

684
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">then answered this in uh-uh but let me</font>

685
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:04,680
give the example i think i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

686
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead 228 nope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 is the one I had it on</font>

687
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:15,720
I guess hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so one of the things</font>

688
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I came about when i was doing two</font>

pieces of work 14 r<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 s and 14 I to NSF</font>

691
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:28,200
is I suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this could be</font>

719
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:03,560
from the transport so that you can

720
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,910
change transports as well as needed or

721
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,670
characteristics of transports as well as

722
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,620
as needed and that attacks on transport

723
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:15,230
does not attack your ability to do your

724

comment from prior discussions we had

783
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:29,620
discussed that rest comp is probably a

784
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,280
better fit for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

785
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,130
are tending to do

786
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,570
just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is the atomicity</font>

787
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,390
that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> expecting a lot for our</font>

788
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,830
applications and less ambiguity as to

789
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,750
what the data stores actually mean

790
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,549
although it sounded<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the datastore</font>

791
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,020
question itself might be getting some

792
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,350
level of refinement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> net cough may</font>

793
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,840
be less of an issue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we're</font>

794
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:52,180
still open to either of them rest camp

795
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,480
was initially a good fit we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

796
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually offers us um but but you</font>

798
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:06,220
the room and will record it and I just

799
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:09,009
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I don't fumble over</font>

anyone's interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Andy's got it</font>

804
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:24,910
maybe one or two uh many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:43,270
scratching their heads will come to net

806
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:48,279
comp and they'll explain more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now</font>

807
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:51,280
ah this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh started out with a</font>

808
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,140
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> panton Andy when</font>

809
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,850
we were describing a whole bunch of

810
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,870
complex things and they gave us a very

811
00:44:54,850 --> 00:45:01,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple solution after that they have</font>

812
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,850
been hard at work making that come from

813
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:06,279
rest comp and all the net mod working

814
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:09,130
right which has made our life easier so

815
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:11,200
I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to go through this they both</font>

816
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:14,080
agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here and throw bricks if I</font>

817
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,970
get it wrong in the past there's been

ken<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe it is your graph yes yep</font>

00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:38,970
please do

830
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:48,650
applied config is actually defined by

the config true nodes as well the orange

834
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,950
everyone assume in the future slides it

835
00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:01,899
the line is down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll send out i'll</font>

837
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:09,919
looks like I still have it but what we

00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:13,040
have in the ephemeral<font color="#CCCCCC"> state ephemeral</font>

839
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,370
does not affect a candidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> or running</font>

840
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:24,529
or startup it is simply something that

841
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:27,770
directly makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> change to the intended</font>

842
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:30,740
configuration stop there and say that

843
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:32,240
again it does not change any of the

844
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:35,209
candidate running<font color="#E5E5E5"> or startup</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">our hackathon example and you know</font>

852
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:59,450
was a good example then the example

862
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:29,419
to have a thermostat IP controlled where

863
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:36,229
you have a temperature and then you have

864
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:38,270
operational state and that derived

865
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:40,670
temper desired temperature might go to

in a general configuration the intended

867
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:46,670

just to say FML true and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've</font>

proposed you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that says this particular thing would</font>

look if you had a press conf you would

have breast comp day that thermostat

901
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:48,530
how might it look in that comp same

902
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:55,120
thing only you would have in this case

903

the full check for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Annette it config</font>

904
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:03,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the basic simple process</font>

very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ephemeral change we found</font>

firewalls<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mahesh a tenant learning so</font>

911
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:25,060
just a quick clarification on what is

912
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:26,590
the feminine validation um I'm glad you

913
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:30,700
asked because it gives me a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

914
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:34,870
restate this and I'm the idea that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

915
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,850
with some implementers and I in a design

916
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:40,690
team asked three different types of

917
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:43,270
implementers and one said gee I do all

918
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:45,220
my checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and upper-level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> odl work</font>

919
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:47,500
that I'm doing for my client and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

920
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,480
want anything I want and availability to

921
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:53,290
have an RPC that just dumps in the

922
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:56,100
traffic and if I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a mistake it's</font>

923
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:59,590
my problem that datastore messes up I

924
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:01,930
torres said that it's your chance if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

925
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:04,120
mess up your data store as andy says it

926
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,819
might be really unuseful for their

927
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,370
favorite clients but you have a

928
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,630
specialized relationship with that one

929
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:12,970
second one might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might not want</font>

930

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do referential checks no must snow</font>

leaf reps that's an option the third one

932
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:23,259
and the default<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is the normal net</font>

comfo validation for validation right

934
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,730
now we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had anyone stand up and</font>

935
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,640
say just reporting one chair to another

936
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:33,310
I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the no validation however</font>

937
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,670
the people who suggested it aren't here

938
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:42,279
so it'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list one and yeah i</font>

939
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:44,470
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is all educational i am</font>

940
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really thrilled that you are all kindly</font>

941
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:50,799
listening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> andy you can restate from</font>

942
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:54,540
a headlock and maybe you know there can

943
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:58,630
be considerations that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg will will</font>

944
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:02,050
agree to but the the premise here is

945
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:04,540
that the client is trusted is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

946
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:07,180
data so i don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> duplicate the</font>

947
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:09,040
work over on the server side which is

948
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:13,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely not how the protocol is</font>

949
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:17,440
written which is untrusting and fearful

of of hackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is correct and before</font>

little chat with my ad

shoot yourself in the foot you shoot

yourself in the foot but please remote

question go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris so we don't see</font>

you're in acute out ah hi can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font>

962
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:09,730
me you can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we can hear you</font>

963
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,050
awesome so I'm sort of i'm coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

964
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:13,300
this pretty new although i've been

965
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:16,150
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this OP state stuff for</font>

966
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,770
a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got a question when we</font>

967
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,660
saw i see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have like the</font>

968
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Intendant config in the ephemeral can</font>

969
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,609
intended so I I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously like the</font>

970
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:27,700
ephemeral would would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be overriding the</font>

971
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:29,500
intended is that right it is correct so

972
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,089
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're gonna and I haven't</font>

973
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,860
read the draft and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may have already</font>

974
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:35,920
solved this but it might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem we</font>

975
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:38,410
have to solve still on a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use</font>

976
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,960
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're thinking of with this is uh</font>

977
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:44,230
we have a lot of use or at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

978
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,160
the use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases is where we have maybe a</font>

979
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Damon's or managers that are out in the</font>

980
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:54,700
in the config system that are checking

981
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,410
basically you know subscribed or

982
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,839
whatever and checking intended and

983
00:53:56,410 --> 00:54:01,330
applied and then noting any differences

984
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,040
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so for example if if something</font>

985
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:06,940
doesn't go to applied after show amount

986
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,740
of time raise an alarm so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess is</font>

987
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:12,430
there some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of indication in the</font>

988
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:15,879
applied whether that applied config has

989
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:19,029
been over ruled or overridden by the

990
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,640
ephemeral so that you so that you know

991
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are checking know that the</font>

992
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:26,890
the can be applied that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

993
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:28,650
shouldn't match the intended config so

994
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:32,410
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the question in two pieces</font>

995
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:35,069
in the normal net comp and again that

996
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:36,930
conf folks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian the rest correct</font>

997
00:54:35,069 --> 00:54:40,558
there's both the synchronous and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

998
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:43,709
synchronous right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming in</font>

999
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,900
your question you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not asking about</font>

1000
00:54:43,709 --> 00:54:47,848
the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the asynchronous</font>

1001
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:53,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the synchronous right the</font>

1002
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:56,219
asynchronous may have the may have

1003
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:58,410
changed the sense stuff to the applied

1004
00:54:56,219 --> 00:55:00,479
config but it's not actually I've been

1005
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,920
applied yet where the synchronous my

1006
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:04,468
understanding is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgement</font>

1007
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,019
coming back actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> says that that it's</font>

1008
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:09,029
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> been applied I'm assuming that's</font>

1009
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:10,828
not the question what you're asking is

1010
00:55:09,029 --> 00:55:14,190
what happens if the ire to us over

1011
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:16,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">rights the intended config and if it</font>

1012
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,619
overwrites the intended config the

1013
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:22,199
intended config is changed and it

1014
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:24,410
doesn't and whenever it does that a

1015
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:27,299
synchronous right or synchronous right

1016
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:30,569
those changes that were in the attendant

1017
00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:33,119
config actually go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one suit so</font>

1018
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:35,519
the place that the online code has to

1019
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:40,229
actually detect that the ephemeral has

1020
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:42,598
overwritten the configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is in</font>

1021
00:55:40,229 --> 00:55:45,569
the Intendant config in the

1022
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:47,880
implementation we we tried to do in the

1023
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:50,489
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> demon Chris we were just going</font>

1024
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put for the the route to the routing</font>

1025
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:55,650
demon we were going to treat our tres is

1026
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:57,569
a different protocol and like I ospf

1027
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:59,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Riss would have been a protocol and that</font>

1028
00:55:57,569 --> 00:56:04,709
ways the way we would detect inside

1029
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:07,109
essentially the values that would be

1030
00:56:04,709 --> 00:56:09,779
written from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rib that might be a</font>

1031
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:11,819
little hacking but it was yeah that

1032
00:56:09,779 --> 00:56:13,859
one's a little complex let me can I jump

1033
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:15,660
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the easy the the easy example he</font>

1034
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:18,239
gave earlier was like a thermostat so

1035
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:21,269
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I've net can't config you know</font>

1036
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:24,029
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal method um I've set a</font>

1037
00:56:21,269 --> 00:56:25,769
temperature in that's an intended config

1038
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:28,140
and then I have a client come in and

1039
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:30,598
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that temperature into an</font>

1040
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,989
ephemeral you know raise it five degrees

1041
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:35,880
or whatever now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this manager out</font>

1042
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:37,619
there running around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when it queries</font>

1043
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,869
it's just basically looking at you know

1044
00:56:37,619 --> 00:56:42,299
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the path to the</font>

1045
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:44,279
intended config for the temperature<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1046
00:56:42,299 --> 00:56:45,630
then it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the path to</font>

1047
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:47,699
the applied and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say are</font>

1048
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,839
these matching are you saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

1049
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,940
the ephemeral client

1050
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:52,828
changes the the thing when i look at the

1051
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,599
in the normal intended config path that

1052
00:56:52,829 --> 00:56:57,869
will change to the ephemeral value

1053
00:56:54,599 --> 00:57:00,900
that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that works on</font>

1054
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:02,999
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks I actually the</font>

1055
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,239
next step for you all is that I'm going

1056
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:08,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you a route example of this idea</font>

1057
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">but let me start with the little</font>

1058
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:17,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature control and make sure</font>

1059
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:20,960
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1060
00:57:17,249 --> 00:57:24,479
was going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the net comp</font>

1061
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,979
changes how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like me to</font>

1062
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:28,109
walk through the changes or how many

1063
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:29,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would like me to walk I was going</font>

1064
00:57:28,109 --> 00:57:33,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go walk through the route case given</font>

1065
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:35,759
the audience which is not as many net

1066
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,710
comp people as routing people and then

1067
00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:39,900
I'll come back through all the changes

1068
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:43,170
that are listed in the protocol

1069
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:54,569
straumann<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then I'll take that</font>

1070
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:56,219
approach so whomever is dial this thing

1071
00:57:54,569 --> 00:58:01,999
into another session you might want to

1072
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:01,999
drop the valium a little bit thank you

1073
00:58:02,299 --> 00:58:09,059
it's that other room Wow in someone what

1074
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,769
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and tell you to I don't think</font>

1075
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">so yeah well I thought sometimes</font>

1076
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:15,508
listening on their phone so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we turned</font>

1077
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:20,369
off this one so then we did it laughter

1078
00:58:15,509 --> 00:58:28,109
villain<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I dad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is a very</font>

1079
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:30,599
simple routing case 1 128 tattoo with

1080
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:36,328
next up one added by netcom config

1081
00:58:30,599 --> 00:58:38,670
woohoo 191 28 that two plus 16 added

1082
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:40,920
with next hop to buy ephemeral rights

1083
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:44,609
over it that's our little client writing

1084
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,499
over it and it's being it that's

1085
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:49,288
happening for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very example of a das</font>

1086
00:58:46,499 --> 00:58:50,879
client you want to send this traffic a

1087
00:58:49,289 --> 00:58:57,479
different way maybe you want to send it

1088
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:59,960
uh to the sink soup we more precise to

1089
00:58:57,479 --> 00:59:02,580
say overlay then over rights and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font>

1090
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">128 16 one will come</font>

1091
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,720
back if the if everyone goes away yes it

1092
00:59:04,890 --> 00:59:09,230
would probably be right to say over<font color="#CCCCCC"> lake</font>

1093
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,089
we've used<font color="#E5E5E5"> over right in the past but</font>

1094
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:18,090
let me I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

1095
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:22,100
example it is overlay when the box for

1096
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:22,100
boots it'll come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the original</font>

1097
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:29,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so here's our little higher to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

1098
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:33,960
agent it's writing to the ephemeral

1099
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:36,300
intended that running rights to the

1100

intended config ephemeral rights over it

1101
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:41,370
let's see how that look oh by the way

1102
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:44,460
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table in case you</font>

1104

1105
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:54,990
route data simply first time that the

running<font color="#E5E5E5"> config</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> writes 128 dot it should</font>

00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:00,390
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to their next up one to the</font>

intended config and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scheduler client</font>

1109
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:04,770
which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client Chris was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

1110
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:06,690
about is reading from the intended

01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:10,830
config and<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading from the apply cake</font>

1112
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:12,630
thank you Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> for making it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real this</font>

1113
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:14,580
was an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've used for a while</font>

1114
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:17,100
but I'm thrilled to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear it might</font>

1115
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:18,720
actually be there in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world then</font>

1116
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:22,319
when you put it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implied config</font>

1117
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,990
your ID would have next hop the route

1118
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:31,560
installed as most people see in their

1119
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:34,529
routing table<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the scheduler still</font>

1120
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:37,230
might continue to monitor in the archos

1121
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:40,350
client might continue to do normal that

1122
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:42,930
comp reading and read in the running

1123
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:47,490
store but it will also read in the

1124
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:49,080
intended config with the replacement ok

1125
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:51,120
so the scheduler might be checking

1126
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,730
what's happening and the IPS might

1127
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,339
replace the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing is an ephemeral</font>

1128
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:58,290
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coated in yellow that gets put</font>

1129
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:00,570
in the applied config<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get an</font>

1130
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:04,440
install case where you have net comp<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

and off the traffic goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync what</font>

01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,100
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like</font>

1133
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:32,670
I've got one air in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> just when it's</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> context right dandy yes thank you</font>

1135
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:37,420
things change in rest comp and I thought

1136
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:41,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">I cut all we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think if you had rest comp</font>

1137
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:44,020
you do a put with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the running rib with</font>

1138
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:46,900
the route with the next top if you did

1139
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:50,850
an edit config with the next top<font color="#CCCCCC"> two you</font>

1140
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,850
would just put the context ephemeral

1141
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:59,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and you might see the reading of</font>

1142
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:04,089
the actual ephemeral data store where

1143
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:05,980
you this is where I'm not sure any if we

1144
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,710
just rent the applied config we wouldn't

1145
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:18,720
have to specify the ephemeral to find it

1146
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:23,040
it wouldn't be there right anymore okay

1147
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,040
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's changed</font>

1148
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:35,349
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple change for the</font>

1149
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:40,900
config and then it gets installed like

1150
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:44,890
everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we found</font>

I'm looking for my neck cut example

1153
01:02:48,480 --> 01:03:00,940
think we'll stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that one and go</font>

1154

back here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask is there any I'll ask</font>

1155

this reboots it's gone if another

1159

ephemeral client overwrites it it's gone

1160
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:24,759
say the scheduler client<font color="#CCCCCC"> over wrote it</font>

thinking of a single solution questions

01:03:45,549 --> 01:03:55,710
on this basic ok so our basic tools for

our ra chua<font color="#CCCCCC"> sproat acall are</font>

01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:01,779
traceability our log and this very

simple use of ephemeral state the

1175
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:17,470
I see you smile at last I see two people

1176
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:20,649
smiling in the death then<font color="#E5E5E5"> cultures so</font>

1177
01:04:17,470 --> 01:04:22,529
I'm check could you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 20 years</font>

1178
01:04:20,650 --> 01:04:25,059
where you want to start data models

preggers yet 1428 where you want to

1180
01:04:25,059 --> 01:04:30,609
insert the whole set ah 1420 are there

<font color="#E5E5E5">any questions about the protocol stuff</font>

1182
01:04:30,609 --> 01:04:36,130
is important to get feedback the data

1183
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:38,440
models are all progressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go from</font>

1184
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:41,319
there any questions about the protocol

1185
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,829
in general since most of you are

1186
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:44,529
thinking

1187
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:46,209
about the functional aspects the next

1188
01:04:44,529 --> 01:04:50,289
we're about to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deep dive on</font>

1189
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:52,239
that come please Joe Clark it it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1190
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:53,979
be what you would consider basic but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1191
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,920
goes to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment I made on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straw</font>

1192
01:04:53,979 --> 01:05:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">man the whole pane of glass thinking to</font>

1193
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:05,700
me at least brakes literally shatters if

1194
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:08,200
you do the next right to intended config

1195
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:10,269
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what you're saying is if</font>

1196
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,430
I then<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to intended config with</font>

1197
01:05:10,269 --> 01:05:15,549
like netcom to the actual what you call

1198
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:18,219
normal data store that pane of glass

1199
01:05:15,549 --> 01:05:20,589
shatters on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I win by</font>

1200
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:24,789
default because I'm allow you can write

1201
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:26,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next configuration I ok no no are</font>

1202
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:27,940
you coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from running are you coming</font>

1203
01:05:26,229 --> 01:05:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">from their fist fight I'm coming from</font>

1204
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:35,650
running you're right it shatters it goes

1205
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:38,920
away because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ok I finished that</font>

1206
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:41,499
is default is a default I get our direct

1207
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:44,680
it shatters the pane of glass because

1208
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:46,899
config changes and that is in the

1209
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:54,489
architecture document as Joe will let

1210
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:56,829
you know right am I channeling Joel Joel

1211
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">halperin that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what people</font>

1212
01:05:56,829 --> 01:06:01,959
get confused is your phrasing which says

1213
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:05,249
it does this by default but you can do

1214
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:08,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say you can configure it to</font>

1215
01:06:05,249 --> 01:06:10,868
preserve to pay attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it if you</font>

1216
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,670
we do have a what is it setting if you

1217
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:14,829
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed this setting up any</font>

1218
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:18,160
particular way and the setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then</font>

1219
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:20,440
that normal changes to config take

1220
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:23,670
precedence when they get applied but

1221
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:26,619
that's that's the death simply a

1222
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:28,660
behavior among the allowed range because

1223
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:31,329
different operators have different

1224
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:35,319
requirements so as an operator you could

1225
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:40,900
say config never writes over ephemeral

1226
01:06:35,319 --> 01:06:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok if it changes you don't oh ok I it</font>

1227
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't clear for your strawman and</font>

1228
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:47,529
that's why I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comment if that</font>

1229
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:51,038
included comic the the normal or the the

1230
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:53,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">running config and if it is the default</font>

1231
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:55,950
is it mandatory to implement something

1232
01:06:53,380 --> 01:07:00,430
that's not that

1233
01:06:55,950 --> 01:07:03,460
it's not this is it if you're saying

1234
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:05,740
it's the default but is an operator can

1235
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:08,260
I assume then that my vendor who is

1236
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,720
implementing the agent side of I to RS

1237
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,940
would allow me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something where the</font>

1238
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,169
pane of glass takes precedence no matter

1239
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">what one would hope you have an</font>

1240
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">intelligent vendor and that would be the</font>

1241
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">assumption should I write something like</font>

1242
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:22,780
that in there that's what I'm as I'm

1243
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:25,390
thinking yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay will you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make you drop</font>

1244
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,100
me a note and just just<font color="#CCCCCC"> unused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1245
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:28,660
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tried that comment on the list</font>

1246
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:30,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's but it's everyone's out here now</font>

1247
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:33,279
but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to continue like Asian</font>

1248
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:35,500
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you just said promise so</font>

1249
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,500
that's why I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking at least drop am a</font>

1250
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:41,530
list so I fix it so we have a question a

1251
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:45,210
question on jabber from rahul Agarwal

1252
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:50,020
what is the role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scheduler client</font>

1253
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:53,620
the scheduler client is just any<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS</font>

1254
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:57,220
client I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1255
01:07:53,620 --> 01:08:01,660
example that Chris hops kindly brought

1256
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:07,750
up before I had the drawing it's just an

1257
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:10,930
example it could be any to clients ok

1258
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:15,220
all of you came to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1259
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:17,559
about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2's are there any questions on</font>

1260
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:21,040
the basics because then if we deep dive

1261
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:24,280
into the net comp and restaurant details

1262
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,010
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that you don't get</font>

1263
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:30,399
lost anybody have any concerns about

1264
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:32,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this think does this seem reasonable how</font>

1265
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:37,269
many people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a reasonable</font>

1266
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:42,700
first pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't</font>

1267
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:44,470
think it is a bad first pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay be</font>

1268
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:49,059
good to hear why this is a bad first

1269
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:54,730
pass oh I'm sorry how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

1270
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass okay how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

1271
01:08:54,729 --> 01:09:00,759
would not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> approve this as a</font>

1272
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,490
first pass okay so we're pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1273
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:06,400
anybody have any questions about their

1274
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:10,469
the basic version<font color="#E5E5E5"> one there is a</font>

1275
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,469
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> q please in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the queue</font>

1276
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:17,620
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> again thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being the</font>

1277
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:19,120
question yes so um the scheduler client

1278
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:21,790
so that from what I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you</font>

1279
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier the you know the I have an</font>

1280
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:26,920
overlay in of the ephemeral on this

1281
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:30,700
slide here in the yellow top yellow box

1282
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:34,779
of the route 128<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 16 ID next type ID</font>

1283
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's overlaying that would the</font>

1284
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:39,550
running data store I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

1285
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:43,359
diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wrong you can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me if I'm</font>

1286
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:45,130
wrong in my viewing of it but the black

1287
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,740
arrow that you have going to running

1288
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:50,260
data store<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think is is possible</font>

1289
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:52,240
now right because when you're pointing

1290
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:54,700
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in it the intended config with</font>

1291
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:57,670
the overlay that is the running data

1292
01:09:54,700 --> 01:10:00,429
store so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this I think</font>

1293
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be drawn is that that black line</font>

1294
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:07,390
goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the applied config so you</font>

1295
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:09,370
know what I'm saying like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you overlay</font>

1296
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:13,390
the intended config that's what the

1297
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:15,220
running datastore is um source you know

1298
01:10:13,390 --> 01:10:17,890
I mean the running Gators were logical

1299
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:20,290
that I'm putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black line from the</font>

1300
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:23,560
scheduler down to the applied config

1301
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:28,630
would match your description yeah yeah

1302
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:31,500
oh and since that's a real case uh the

1303
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:35,560
reason I had it drawn this way was to

1304
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:40,930
remind me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an iOS client could use</font>

1305
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:43,630
regular configuration gets to go through

1306
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:45,370
the net comp channel to grab a

1307
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:47,410
configuration as well there's nothing

1308
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:49,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that always no no that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I</font>

1309
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I I that's why I'm asking</font>

1310
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,230
this question because what I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1311
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">say earlier was that I couldn't I</font>

1312
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:58,269
wouldn't see that ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 anymore when i</font>

1313
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,610
when i go and i look at the config and I

1314
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:04,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do again look at the config yes i'm</font>

1315
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:06,639
sorry you cannot see in the intended

1316
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:10,180
config you could see it in the running

1317
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:14,440
config those are the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing no they</font>

1318
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:18,220
are not according to my expert getting

1319
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:22,690
really confused now because the running

1320
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:26,730
data store is separate from the I to RS

1321
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:29,559
ephemeral state<font color="#E5E5E5"> running datastore is is</font>

1322
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,179
always lower priority than I to RS

1323
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:36,190
otherwise what's the point of doing this

1324
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:38,800
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait um okay right so so if and I</font>

1325
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:41,440
think you're so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the running data</font>

1326
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,560
store if I do it edit config on running

1327
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:47,379
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rap that's the configured</font>

1328
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,090
route if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do a get config on the</font>

1329
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,620
running datastore<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get back that</font>

1330
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:52,480
configure back that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was trying</font>

1331
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:56,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay that was all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eye to</font>

1332
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:59,769
RS right on the ephemeral data that oh

1333
01:11:56,230 --> 01:12:04,599
that now is go the system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1334
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:06,730
try to apply that and basically the the

1335
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:11,650
running datastore gets ignored unless

1336
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:13,959
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs data goes away okay yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1337
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:16,449
all correct let me let me give you this

1338
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:21,340
question before you go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> that chris</font>

1339
01:12:16,449 --> 01:12:24,730
is asking if you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client could it</font>

1340
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:26,380
read the running client not<font color="#E5E5E5"> via our</font>

1341
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:30,070
truest but could it read the running

1342
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:32,560
datastore at that point not the intended

1343
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:35,290
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> running may I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wilmette</font>

1344
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,030
comforters that was get config this yeah

1345
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:39,820
those are the same so sue those are the

1346
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:42,340
same thing basically that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended</font>

1347
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:47,199
config is is is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I have</font>

1348
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:49,630
configured in my running data store I'm

1349
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:52,360
so the question here is whether you can

1350
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:55,260
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> both ephemeral and the intended and</font>

1351
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:58,839
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you're saying you can't you can</font>

1352
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:01,570
this is jeff so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're having our</font>

1353
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,280
usual hang up a nitrous that certain of

1354
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:06,460
these words have very distinct meanings

1355
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:09,219
at netcom so<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in the context of</font>

1356
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:10,840
net conf is from the configuration data

1357
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:13,870
store which we would call static and

1358
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:16,570
fake out of hrs the intended config if

1359
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:20,290
i'm remembering my verbiage correctly is

1360
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:23,380
the merged view of the running config

1361
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:25,180
from static merged with the hrs

1362
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:29,469
ephemeral configuration do I have that

1363
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:34,750
right Andy yeah so it's this the server

1364
01:13:29,469 --> 01:13:36,190
is uh the parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> running config that</font>

1365
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:38,980
are not being

1366
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:43,739
overridden still apply and so it's a

1367
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:43,739
composite of that that becomes the

1368
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:51,820
applied config and dry state to ask you

1369
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:53,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that which particular datastore am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

1370
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,840
I getting it from ephemeral then you

1371
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:58,989
might get next top<font color="#CCCCCC"> two if I get it from</font>

1372
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,750
running static then they wit next top

1373
01:13:58,989 --> 01:14:04,509
one and this sort of answer the second

1374
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:07,830
half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your question Chris is that as</font>

1375
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:11,440
part of the protocol requirements draft

1376
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:13,390
the get and get config type operations

1377
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:15,849
will probably require some level

1378
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:18,160
extension to say which view you're

1379
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:20,650
looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> no so you can specify Africa</font>

1380
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:23,410
will get from running which will get you

1381
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:26,500
the static configuration there'll be a

1382
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:28,440
different way to ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the applied</font>

1383
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,280
configuration that's the merged view and

1384
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:32,530
similarly they may be a way to a

1385
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:35,199
specifically do a get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gives you</font>

1386
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:36,550
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ephemeral state so yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1387
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:38,259
that's that's different from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

1388
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:40,000
that was different when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth at</font>

1389
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:42,489
that's more complex than the earlier

1390
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,410
answer right I I wish we did weren't

1391
01:14:42,489 --> 01:14:46,929
even talking about running data store

1392
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:49,269
right I like the concept is calling it

1393
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:50,920
static config right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't</font>

1394
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:53,260
have to have data stores here to make my

1395
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,420
point my point is is that through normal

1396
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,180
channels I've set my configuration my

1397
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:00,430
static configuration then I have I to RS

1398
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:04,750
come in and put in a femoral overlay on

1399
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:07,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> girl when I say look what do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1400
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,560
configured on this box that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm asking</font>

1401
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the intended config and what I'm</font>

1402
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,670
hearing is that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the the</font>

1403
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:14,530
overlay and that's fine and then what

1404
01:15:12,670 --> 01:15:16,060
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pointing out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you you</font>

1405
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:19,690
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the white box then</font>

1406
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:23,860
it's been overlaid<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes you only see</font>

1407
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:26,830
the overlay cool so it still makes sense

1408
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:29,440
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I like the new arrow have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1409
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:31,690
account um so just thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> these slides</font>

1410
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,370
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I are confusing because the</font>

1411
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:35,290
running datastore you have a line going

1412
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:36,790
down to intended config but really the

1413
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,710
intended configuration is the composite

1414
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:41,680

1419
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:54,579
will change<font color="#E5E5E5"> both thank you both</font>

1420
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:58,929
for the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what time do we close</font>

1421
01:15:54,579 --> 01:16:04,420
today we end it 1414 under so we have a

1422
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:07,480
bit longer good so<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there any other</font>

1423
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:12,389
confusions on the basic or shall we jump

1424
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:15,129
into the net come and rest comp changes

1425
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:17,020
please if you're confused obviously the

1426
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:22,270
experts<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been confused your</font>

01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:28,000
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go into please go ahead Jason just</font>

1429
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:31,030
more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment probably would help if</font>

1430
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,530
we do if we alter these slides to be

1431
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:36,219
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> explicit with some more</font>

01:16:36,219 --> 01:16:39,280
here's your initial config here's what

1434
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:41,320
you read from intended here what's

here's what you read from applied here's

what you read from derive state then

read from there I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need</font>

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> details in here to make sure we're</font>

1444
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:01,269
walks through it with some comments

1445
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:08,079
would be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm into lots of</font>

1447
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:12,840
anyone like to ask before we do that

1448
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,840
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1449
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:40,750
okay the net conferen<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest count folks</font>

1450
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:44,440
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good and they have a form</font>

1451
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:46,750
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially walk through add to</font>

1452
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:49,379
fill in new capabilities is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1453
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:52,150
way to describe it that I use the right

1454
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:55,180
you usually have a very nice form when I

1455
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:57,009
find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe what you want to</font>

1456
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:58,750
change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that conference comp so</font>

1457
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully I filled in the form brightly</font>

1458
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:07,930
so again what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in a femoral data store</font>

1459
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:10,840
in a more precise way it is not intended

1460
01:18:07,930 --> 01:18:14,560
to decipher a survivor reboot it is

1461
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:19,380
never relocked new existing never locked

1462
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:21,760
or relocked or change one pane of glass

1463
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:25,560
versus the config one pane of glass

1464
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,420
we've just gone through that discussion

1465
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:31,540
Joe do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we got it will</font>

1466
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:33,670
hopefully clarify it a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1467
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:47,560
can does the concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

1468
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:51,880
discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense we should visit</font>

1469
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike a microphone please Joe Clark again</font>

1470
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,980
I make sense I don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

1471
01:18:55,060 --> 01:19:01,300
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it should play more with</font>

1472
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:04,150
the whole priority the config the

1473
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:05,410
persistent configure the non ephemeral

1474
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,269
config should play more with the

1475
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:10,210
ephemeral config in terms of priority

1476
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:12,460
because to me it makes sense until you

1477
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:14,050
say oh well it's the last right so you

1478
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:16,210
have to take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> that temporal</font>

1479
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:18,940
aspect of it too you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just looking</font>

1480
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:20,260
at ephemeral so you have to take into

1481
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:23,040
account that that ephemeral pain

1482
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:25,900
shatters the next time you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

1483
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:27,670
but like was pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it is in the</font>

1484
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:29,710
architecture is the default and you can

1485
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:32,020
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the good the good point is</font>

1486
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:33,790
once we've sort of close this first one

1487
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:36,340
my suggestion is

1488
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:39,640
that you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on a design team</font>

1489
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:41,380
to go through the other one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just will</font>

1490
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:43,120
close one off and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of a</font>

1491
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:45,520
better time by the time it gets standard

1492
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,040
you can always overwrite the current

1493
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:51,370
stuff so that's that's my strong suit

1494
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:55,060
that was my agreement with my co-chair

1495
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:57,010
and AD is but please you and Russ I hope

1496
01:19:55,060 --> 01:20:06,160
we'll work on that over the next couple

1497
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:08,080
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok um multiple clients can write</font>

1498
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:12,070
to the one pane of glass but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest</font>

1499
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">party wins you can signal a capability</font>

1500
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:20,139
for note via hello and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through</font>

1501
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:22,840
the air checking the dependencies are

1502
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:25,540
the ephemeral flag it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

1503
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have too many people looking for the</font>

1504
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:32,710
validation flank<font color="#E5E5E5"> but i'll have to check</font>

1505
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:34,900
that my hessian and so and yang models

1506
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:43,360
must support notifications of right

1507
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:47,230
complex new operations you'll need a

1508
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,929
link config link ephemeral to a target

1509
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:53,950
config at least that's my understanding

1510
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:56,410
for link and bulk right but i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1511
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:58,630
that bulk right was for the for the

1512
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,870
routes and everything in our data

1513
01:20:58,630 --> 01:21:03,580
centers data models uses an RPC so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1514
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:06,309
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to do bulk right in</font>

1515
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:08,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just might come I just</font>

1516
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:10,560
didn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> any you aren't doing any bulk</font>

1517
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:20,769
rights are you you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just using regular</font>

1518
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:22,930
rights for the topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um get config</font>

1519
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:25,120
edit config I think I've gone through

1520
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:33,010
all the support non-support you can read

1521
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:35,970
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe the same is true</font>

1522
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:35,970
for rest comp

1523
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:48,000
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's much different and</font>

1524
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:51,720
you need to use the femoral context and

1525
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,670
your head<font color="#E5E5E5"> muster in risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of go ahead my</font>

1526
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:55,920
hands shaking and running so if you see

1527
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:58,350
if if you're good for people like me

1528
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,740
will probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not involved in all</font>

1529
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:06,150
the discussions for the ephemeral

1530
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:09,059
validation is go back to why it was

1531
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:11,190
needed separately from safety validation

1532
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:14,430
that again we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the discussion</font>

1533
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:18,000
on what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to dishonor on the read</font>

1534
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:21,360
and write the three choices were you

1535
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:23,970
trust the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do must</font>

1536
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:26,160
referential checks and you do the full

1537
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:28,610
checking and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something that</font>

1538
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:33,240
would allow you and yang to specify

1539
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:35,759
whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / model on</font>

1540
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:39,510
some models you may never<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to allow</font>

1541
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:41,400
someone to do a fast right for maybe

1542
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:45,960
four the route you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

1543
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:49,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bulk right but maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ospf</font>

1544
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,700
interface never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow that so</font>

1545
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,910
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have full validation</font>

1546
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:57,360
and that was needed especially for a

1547
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:59,880
femoral and not for you know normal

1548
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">netcom doesn't have those are options</font>

1549
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:09,870
for validation right so Andy's comment

1550
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:12,510
is one would be unwise let me say unwise

1551
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:15,930
instead of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other comment to put to</font>

1552
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:20,940
use that in in in that come yet your

1553
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:23,430
previous life had the this validation

1554
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:26,280
specified in the yang but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1555
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:30,480
really correct you you want it so that

1556
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:33,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server is like saying I'm only doing</font>

1557
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:36,500
one two or three and not the client

1558
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:39,720
picking it see if the client picks it

1559
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:41,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">client once it's something says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh set</font>

1560
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:43,770
this route over here with no validation

1561
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:45,600
client do comes along and says set my

1562
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:47,610
route over here with validation well

1563
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,600
yank validation doesn't work on one edit

1564
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:51,299
at the time it works on the whole

1565
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,340
database so now client to

1566
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:55,920
his editors going to fail because client

1567
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:58,710
ones at it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another you either get all</font>

1568
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:00,690
your database one way or you get it all

1569
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:02,370
another way well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yang Yang doesn't have</font>

1570
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:04,530
any concept of just validating and edit

1571
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:06,630
it's the whole entire datastore<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font>

1572
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:09,300
had a big argument with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone at Cisco</font>

1573
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:11,430
many many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago about why we do</font>

1574
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:13,740
checking he says I'm writing routing

1575
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:16,560
code and and I'm I can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> too bothered</font>

1576
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:18,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to check parameters because s be fast</font>

1577
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:21,270
and I said well with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box sec faults</font>

1578
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:23,280
how fast you're running now so the

1579
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:27,210
reason we check stuff is to keep the box

1580
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:29,309
from crashing yes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mahesh you have</font>

1581
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:33,210
caught another piece where we thought it

1582
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:45,240
was working on a database obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font>

1583
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the rest of this for the head get</font>

1584
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:52,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">post is just to get the ephemeral and I</font>

1585
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:54,570
think nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is really exciting</font>

1586
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the net come people it's pretty much</font>

1587
01:24:54,570 --> 01:25:04,320
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expect if I'll take questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1588
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:07,740
if not we'll call it a day for today

1589
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:11,070
unless someone has more questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1590
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:13,410
we have left an i er to us time slot

1591
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:16,980

1592
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:18,840
embroiled in some large discussion we

1593
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:21,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have any topic for it it's just</font>
