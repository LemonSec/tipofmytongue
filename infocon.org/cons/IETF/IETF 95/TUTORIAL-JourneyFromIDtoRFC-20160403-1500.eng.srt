1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:12,780
speaking to us today about<font color="#E5E5E5"> um how you go</font>

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,899
from having an internet draft to

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,119
actually becoming an RFC but actually

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's going to talk about something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,099
more fundamental than that but I'll

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,119
leave that up to him to tell you uh fred

7
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:30,810
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a chair of the IETF at a very</font>

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,900
very seminal time um I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course I</font>

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,970
suppose they're all seminal times he's

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,310
been with the IETF many many many years

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,769
and as I think as I said in an

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,330
introduction to someone the other day

13
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,230
fred<font color="#CCCCCC"> has forgotten more than a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

14
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:52,320
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will ever know he's currently</font>

15
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:55,440
co-chair of v6 Ops has at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,970
drafts out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of could have</font>

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,030
changed to 12 or 15 by now he has a

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:08,310
wealth of expertise in many many areas

19
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:09,990
so let's were fortunate enough to have

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:19,590
him so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn this over damn</font>

21
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:23,189
now so I um so by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

22
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,740
RFC editor in the room I will not make

23
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:30,270
her stand up that's so that you won't

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:34,318
mob<font color="#E5E5E5"> her afterwards can you tell she's</font>

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,359
like anyhow but okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so question we get</font>

26
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,780
asked an awful lot Liz<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i posted</font>

27
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,788
an RFC how do i get an RFC number like

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,429
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

29
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:46,679
about somewhere in between if you were

30
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:48,719
AB<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brandner session in this room</font>

31
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:51,780
in the last hour I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to repeat</font>

32
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,189
some of his material but my focus on

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,069
that is going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

34
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,699
different and just looking at it as a

35
00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">workhorse do be writing drafts and</font>

36
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,569
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the right thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out so</font>

37
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,809
yeah we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the journey</font>

38
00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:09,449
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet-draft RFC there's</font>

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,689
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very basic to understand in</font>

40
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:17,119
that process and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the job of</font>

41
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IETF is not to write rfcs</font>

42
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,709
what we do is we solve problems now the

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,500
solution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem quite often is</font>

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,900
documented in turn RFC it's implemented

45
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,160
in code it winds<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in somebody's</font>

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,890
equipment somewhere in some network but

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,760
fundamentally is not about producing an

48
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,769
RFC as a matter of fact well hook

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,049
allocated that on the next slide what

50
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,350
kind of documents we have while we have

51
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,620
our season RFC's and RF season RFC's of

52
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:57,450
several different categories but in the

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,030
IDF our primary focus is on

54
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,880
internet-drafts internet-drafts our

55
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,460
discussion documents there it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,269
white papers they might be

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,180
specifications that are being developed

58
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,040
they might be reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems they</font>

59
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:17,520
might be illness they could be a lot of

60
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:21,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">things let me give you a couple of</font>

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,820
examples of the development of RFC's one

62
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:27,000
of them this happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started it i</font>

63
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,420
started in 1994<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,180
small engineering firm in santa barbara

65
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:38,489
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> acc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we had just we were in the</font>

66
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,310
process of implementing an ISDN the

67
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:45,720
interface how many of you know what is

68
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:49,380
giannios okay one two<font color="#E5E5E5"> three ugh fourth</font>

69
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,940
okay it's an older technology it's

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:56,250
certainly there in 3gpp but it's older

71
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,920
technology but ok so at the time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

72
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:05,430
developing that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I needed a way to</font>

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:08,850
manage it ah and so what i did was i

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">posted an email to the equivalent of the</font>

75
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,019
IETF list of the time it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the tcp/ip</font>

76
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:19,230
list and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said hey you know a bunch of</font>

77
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,810
bunch of us have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I scan implementations</font>

78
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,210
and meds and this that and the other

79
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,910
would people<font color="#CCCCCC"> be willing to post their</font>

80
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,080
men give me a pointer to the web page or

81
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,960
the document

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,878
whatever it is that describes that men

83
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,460
and let us all look at it then we can

84
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discussion about what a common</font>

85
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,710
myth would look like I got eight

86
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,139
responses of people that said yeah I'd

87
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,969
be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then I got a</font>

88
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:51,449
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a fellow by the name of</font>

89
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:54,930
winter rope from Germany who said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

90
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:56,490
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at all of those and I have</font>

91
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,439
figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that everybody's doing</font>

92
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,000
roughly the same thing to call him

93
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,400
different things but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,310
roughly the same thing and I've

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,900
coalesced all that into a document he

96
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:12,840
had done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in 24 hours ah and</font>

97
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:16,229
would you mind friend if I posted that

98
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,799
is an internet draft is like work I

99
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:23,039
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do this sounds great and</font>

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:26,939
so he posted it and it became actually

101
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">two RFC's describing the basic is p.m.</font>

102
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:32,940
nib and then a diagnostic myth how do i

103
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:34,289
find probably in an ISDN network how did

104
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,360
that happen frankly it was a

105
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:38,250
collaboration<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had eight different</font>

106
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,340
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with eight different solutions</font>

107
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:43,909
who posted them I had a guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,589
had one of them as his own solution ah

109
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:49,229
in Germany who's willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the work</font>

110
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:52,710
and then we had a discussion and the

111
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:54,779
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> took about a year ah and then</font>

112
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,568
it went to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC editor's office and</font>

113
00:05:54,779 --> 00:06:03,690
went through<font color="#E5E5E5"> their processes uh but uh</font>

114
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:06,089
resulted in in an outcome which is is in

115
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:11,669
use wherever there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISDN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

116
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:15,120
today can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Collegium ah another</font>

117
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">example is in the secure shell how many</font>

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH all of us use SSH all</font>

119
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,949
time yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the guy that developed</font>

120
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,610
an athlete develop something for his own

121
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:32,250
use and just wrote the code and then

122
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,370
decided he had people<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking him for it</font>

123
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,469
so we put it in open source like people

124
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,839
compile it and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally he described</font>

125
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,960
it in an internet draft which he then

126
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,830
abandoned

127
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,609
didn't do anything with the draft until

128
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:52,508
he had started a company and a whole lot

129
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,849
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff had happened and so we built</font>

130
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,780
what was called secure shell too and

131
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:01,300
that wound up in series<font color="#CCCCCC"> of RFC's it</font>

132
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,809
actually describes that the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

133
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,099
of secure shell which there have been

134
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with getting the play</font>

135
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:10,569
everybody's running secure shell what

136
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,820
his original thing which was only

137
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:18,250
described in the internet draft ah but

138
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:20,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he got RFC's was</font>

139
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,650
basically that there was interest in

140
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:26,020
having a published version and an open

141
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,650
version not one that was proprietary to

142
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:33,940
his company so<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally when found up</font>

143
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,190
with an open version of ssh another

144
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:41,280
process that we went through was in

145
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">congestion control and tcp now in the</font>

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,059
mid-1980s 1985 to 1987 56 kilobits a

147
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,780
mess f'nor was a very popular network

148
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:57,610
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh it underwent congested collapse</font>

149
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:59,880
it bad things happen ah so just before

150
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happened in nineteen eighty-four</font>

151
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">John natal who at the time was a an</font>

152
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,909
engineer at foco Ford was looking for

153
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,969
solutions to our congestion management

154
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:15,820
congestion avoidance came up with what's

155
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:19,810
popularly known<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Naval option in</font>

156
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,360
TCP and then made a more general comment

157
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,259
realized that there was a fundamental

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">flaw in the design of IP which was that</font>

159
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:33,190
time to live it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually time it was</font>

160
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:36,070
measured in seconds and<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the line</font>

161
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:39,370
speeds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time he said wait a second</font>

162
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:42,099
what if somebody actually says well

163
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,620
don't let my packet wait more than 15

164
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,980
seconds but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of 15 in time</font>

165
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:50,800
live and then the pack of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT a queue</font>

166
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,860
depth came into being that was 16

167
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,310
seconds d what I would wind up with is

168
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:59,800
situation in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line was a</font>

169
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,569
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent utilized and achieve</font>

170
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,219
zero throughput because all the packets

171
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:09,550
got discarded when they got to the other

172
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:13,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">side and so we actually experienced that</font>

173
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,279
in 56 kilobits and a SEF net and about

174
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:16,899
that time a young<font color="#E5E5E5"> grad student who</font>

175
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,920
you'll find running around here this

176
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:23,470
week by the name of Dan Jacobson started

177
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:26,439
playing with that and came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

178
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:29,560
solution that was fairly simple but more

179
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:34,600
or less worked and he documented that in

180
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:37,930
a paper in Sigma ah that started the

181
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,860
development of kind of a long series of

182
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,500
changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC series where we went</font>

183
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,079
through and talked about TCP congestion

184
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,440
control talked about congestion in the

185
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:55,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet come on in guys Alice you to</font>

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">your allowed though and you know so</font>

187
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:04,420
processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> by which things become RFC's</font>

188
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:07,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">very but are in essence today but what</font>

189
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do is we document the idea in an</font>

190
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:15,579
internet draft talk about it forever and

191
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,870
and then ultimately send it to to the

192
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:22,149
RFC editor so so that process with<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

193
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,880
frankly there have been a list of other

194
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:27,250
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had that have gone on that</font>

195
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,860
had been related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that so the whole</font>

196
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">quality of service discussion really</font>

197
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,890
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those same observations and</font>

198
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:39,609
so on ah point to remember though is

199
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:42,939
that that entire discussion started with

200
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,760
an RFC that was not standard the white

201
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,019
paper guys throwing out an observation

202
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,420
throwing out an idea and that idea

203
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:56,649
engendered discussion and subsequent

204
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:00,579
standards open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source code so on and so</font>

205
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:05,140
forth ah as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the observation</font>

206
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:07,449
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy made so now let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me talk a</font>

207
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,439
little bit about the theory

208
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:13,090
of the IDF and here you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font>

209
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,650
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were listening sky I've heard</font>

210
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:22,420
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this before so the structure of</font>

211
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas in the areas have</font>

212
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups in the working groups are</font>

213
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,550
managed by the area directors people in

214
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:34,300
be in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg we also have research</font>

215
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:38,500
group I RTF<font color="#CCCCCC"> and various research groups</font>

216
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,930
underneath the eye RTF ah a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

217
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">different organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are there</font>

218
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:47,229
basically for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of ideas</font>

219
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:52,630
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> development of hopefully working</font>

220
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:56,680
code ah when I talk about working group

221
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:59,710
processes most important thing in a

222
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,400
working group is what was it we came

223
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:06,460
here to do ah the Charter so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go</font>

224
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,220
read the Charter<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 16 ops for the</font>

225
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups that I chair it tells me</font>

226
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,930
that first<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> foremost it's a forum for</font>

227
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,099
operators to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

228
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">they experience and to make reports and</font>

229
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,880
say no I'm seeing good things here and

230
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,580
bad things they're related to ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

231
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,130
they come talking about ipv4 it's

232
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,220
technically out of charter it's not

233
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:37,390
something we're supposed to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and</font>

234
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:38,980
so then the next step obviously is that

235
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,790
they might come up with operational

236
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:46,600
workarounds and they might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to go</font>

237
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,150
back to other working groups in the IETF

238
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,090
and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the issues that are</font>

239
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,370
coming up I'll in fact be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on</font>

240
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:58,000
Thursday I believe in the routing

241
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:01,300
working group because in the last

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,930
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Yokohama a comment was made</font>

243
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,449
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> molle homing under a</font>

244
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,670
certain scenario couldn't work unless

245
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,740
routing in a in an enterprise network

246
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:20,199
would get packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right upstream</font>

247
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP and so the IETF needed to do some</font>

248
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,849
work related

249
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,669
rally in terms of making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

250
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:31,949
packets get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P so that</font>

251
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:35,549
got observation is a direct my charter

252
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:38,189
tells me I'm supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that and so</font>

253
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:41,129
I wound up writing an email as chair of

254
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:44,009
the working group to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samaria</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Directors</font>

255
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:47,009
in various working group chairs saying

256
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:49,319
this is a problem that the operators in

257
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,899
my working groups say we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font>

258
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:54,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay how does work get started in the</font>

259
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:57,209
ITF that's one way my working group

260
00:13:54,359 --> 00:14:02,189
specifically starts work in in the ITF

261
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:04,138
ah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter tells us what things a</font>

262
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,149
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group is allowed to work on but</font>

263
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:09,449
if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lab work on gives us some idea</font>

264
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:12,569
of timelines tells us something about

265
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:17,909
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement for the working</font>

266
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and then if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have obviously</font>

267
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:24,659
discussion if you've been on v6 ops

268
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:29,729
mailing list at all we can have wrong

269
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:32,489
discussions and we we meet at I calf

270
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:35,489
meetings and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed between</font>

271
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:39,089
meetings in order to discuss things that

272
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:41,939
need to be discussed and whole bunch of

273
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:44,519
just people talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other I had</font>

274
00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:47,459
a discussion this morning with a bunch

275
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,529
of regulators<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are attending this</font>

276
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,449
meeting in order to learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

277
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,999
processes by which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

278
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:57,059
developed and one of the questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

279
00:14:53,999 --> 00:15:01,469
asked me was how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your</font>

280
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:04,499
projects in ah who tells you what to do

281
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:07,199
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

282
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:10,079
you've chosen a particular thing and

283
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,919
what she was really looking for was so

284
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,138
who's the president of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

285
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,569
fight I'm sorry we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font>

286
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,969
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other and we develop a</font>

287
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:22,139
consensus it's like oh my goodness I

288
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:24,449
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have thought of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

289
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:27,449
cheese from the government of Peru so

290
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:29,248
every order ah but but yeah that's

291
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:32,519
that's what we do in this public

292
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:33,730
discussion is we discuss sense and we

293
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,110
develop

294
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:43,750
a common view point coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of that</font>

295
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:48,490
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay let's do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

296
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,769
with any topic whether it's a working

297
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">group or whether it's a particular</font>

298
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:57,070
project that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write get an</font>

299
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:59,019
address for the first thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

300
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,589
want to know a lot of problem is what

301
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:05,680
the problem is you'd be amazed how many

302
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:07,570
people come to me come to the IETF and

303
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,519
say I have a solution I want to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

304
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,459
my solution please can I work on my

305
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,430
solution I had a guy from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department</font>

306
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,199
of Defense once come into another

307
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,800
working group that I chaired at the time

308
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,420
and basically stomp his feet and say I

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,769
need for you to implement this

310
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:30,010
particular algorithm and and I asked him

311
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:33,370
so so what problem are you solving you

312
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:36,130
know give me let's let's discuss

313
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,449
requirements he said the requirement is

314
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,949
that you implement my algorithm and the

315
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Joint Chiefs of Staff say that you have</font>

316
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:48,279
to he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care and that</font>

317
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,740
really surprised him for me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say y'all</font>

318
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,920
12<font color="#E5E5E5"> * general up there yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

319
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his opinions oh no it's supposed to</font>

320
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,420
salute when they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something okay our</font>

321
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:05,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">first discussion point is always what</font>

322
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,668
problem where we saw them and that that

323
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,470
has various things one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of the</font>

324
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:13,630
aspects of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is to focus discussion</font>

325
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:17,079
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not just running</font>

326
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,569
around all over the map and then to be

327
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,609
able to say that particular part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

328
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:25,119
solution solves a problem that isn't

329
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say no this is this</font>

330
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular part is actually not relevant</font>

331
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,668
and then we'll talk about several

332
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,820
proposals<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned the ISDN myth as</font>

333
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:43,240
an example of the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

334
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,840
became<font color="#E5E5E5"> to RFC's and I pointed out that I</font>

335
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">had 8 input documents none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of way</font>

336
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,139
were the direct RF see that eventually

337
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:55,990
got written<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're all each of</font>

338
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:59,110
them who's a separate proposal is what

339
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:02,130
some company was<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah in order to</font>

340
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,979
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out so i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

341
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:10,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually more than one some kinds a whole</font>

342
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,880
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different proposals and one of</font>

343
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:15,100
the jobs of the working group is to sort

344
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,070
through them and say this is actually

345
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,770
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good solution these three actually</font>

346
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,990
are what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do they have in common is their</font>

347
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,929
common architecture we can pull out of

348
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is there you know how do these</font>

349
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:33,039
things fit together do they fit together

350
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:35,580
maybe they don't ah but so in an

351
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,929
internet draft what we're doing is

352
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:43,360
making a suggestion and discussing the

353
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:46,870
ramifications of that suggestion the

354
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,899
working group is going to now work

355
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:52,539
through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe it'll adopt it</font>

356
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:56,080
very likely it will change it in some

357
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:58,419
way before adopting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's quite</font>

358
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,090
calm and please don't be upset when it

359
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:07,090
happens it's the way people work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ah</font>

360
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:10,709
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> our objective is not to write an</font>

361
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:17,289
RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to discuss and solve a problem</font>

362
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:20,380
and so it's all about giving customers

363
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,750
giving operators giving people that are

364
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:27,010
running whatever application videos

365
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:30,820
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking aspect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is giving</font>

366
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:33,039
them good solutions to their problems so

367
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,668
we're obviously going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to merge and</font>

368
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,320
select proposals and develop a consensus

369
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:42,880
around whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution we eventually</font>

370
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,950
come up with Scott if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

371
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,309
previous session had a slide talk a

372
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:49,779
little bit about intellectual property

373
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,720
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that tends to happen</font>

374
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,510
during this discussion of formulating<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

375
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,350
consensus is that somebody will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

376
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,059
and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if we ask them I</font>

377
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,520
oh by the way here's this thing that I

378
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:08,590
really think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

379
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,918
if you do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kami this is my way of</font>

380
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:14,199
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> money and working groups here</font>

381
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,830
quite often say why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we do</font>

382
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,929
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else our intellectual property</font>

383
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:26,049
is not forbidden but it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

384
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:27,940
discussions harder because the working

385
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,520
group quite often will step back and say

386
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,890
is there a way that's not uncommon is

387
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,918
there a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't have somebody</font>

388
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:42,039
making money as a result at the end of

389
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:45,909
the day what we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

390
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:48,400
rough consensus and running hug ah rough

391
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:51,669
consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you talk a little bit</font>

392
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,590
about what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that doesn't mean</font>

393
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everybody in the room degrees I'd</font>

394
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,570
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have everybody in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room agree</font>

395
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,990
sometimes there's somebody who just I'm

396
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,879
sorry he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree the</font>

397
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,150
interesting thing with that is that

398
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:12,880
quite often we find that the minority is

399
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:15,220
right he has he or she<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some thing</font>

400
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,950
that that that he's looked at and

401
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:22,059
realized you know if we all go do this

402
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,940
that bad thing will happen and so we

403
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:27,490
actually now stop and really listen to

404
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that person and say tell me about that</font>

405
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,580
what is it and why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's that</font>

406
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad thing is going to happen and</font>

407
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,039
then after we've heard them out we might

408
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,500
make a change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal that we're</font>

409
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on in order to fix whatever it</font>

410
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,500
is that we're doing or we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

411
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,270
actually don't agree that that bad thing

412
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:54,970
will help um we as a group if<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed</font>

413
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've heard you out we understand</font>

414
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:02,740
your viewpoint but we disagree and at

415
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is obviously</font>

416
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:10,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">still they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't like the proposal</font>

417
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,999
ah but the working group is now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

418
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,189
say so we have rough consensus

419
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:18,279
consensus among everybody except that

420
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:20,499
one or that that couple of people and

421
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:25,539
and that's really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

422
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:29,049
we'd like to have full consensus we will

423
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:31,839
settle for rough consensus for somebody

424
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:34,509
disagreeing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've heard out that</font>

425
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,839
we've listened to that we convince

426
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:42,759
ourselves that their point isn't gala

427
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:45,428
isn't strong enough what we're really

00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:39,759
starts out in the IHF first we need a

446
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:42,099
set of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are interested in</font>

447
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,719
working on if we don't have a set of

448
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:46,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that are interested in working on</font>

453
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,019
usually happen is that we'll have

454
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:09,579
basically an informal meeting that

455
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:14,409
happens it often<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens in a bar often</font>

456
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:17,438
with alcohol are it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not formal meeting</font>

457
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,409
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you go get a</font>

458
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:22,499
room and let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a marketing</font>

459
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:25,539
presentation for that kind of thing

460
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:26,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in that bunch of</font>

461
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:28,970
Engineers

462
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,130
it happened to be interested in a

463
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,380
problem and let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it let's</font>

464
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,930
see if we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop that community</font>

465
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,650
that that commonality among people that

466
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:42,830
are working here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ought to go</font>

467
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:47,060
work on that and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course going</font>

468
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,949
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclude a problem statement you're</font>

469
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,350
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe what problem</font>

470
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,750
you think you're solving and you might

471
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:58,399
have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of possible solutions to</font>

472
00:24:53,750 --> 00:25:01,250
it ah and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point what you really</font>

473
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,400
want to do post an internet draft

474
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:09,140
describing that problem and and then

475
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,870
start perhaps a mailing list or some

476
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:15,080
other discussion format and get that

477
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:17,389
community talking to itself talking

478
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,220
among itself and saying you know here

479
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,040
here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

480
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,950
environment now once you've built that

481
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,350
community then you go to an area

482
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,600
director and say I have a problem I have

483
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,600
community I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions going on</font>

484
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,340
here it really kind of looks like a

485
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,260
working group in the process of

486
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:41,120
formation and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area director</font>

487
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,000
assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that analysis is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

488
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,250
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,220
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is have what we call a working group</font>

490
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:53,300
forming off it birds of a feather

491
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,430
session at an ietf painting and let's

492
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,190
actually agree on the Charter formally

493
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:59,810
in and then chartered the working group

494
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go do that figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> timeline</font>

495
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing ah and</font>

496
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,130
that discussion you'll find documented

497
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:16,100
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ball tracker which is one of the</font>

498
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:18,140
tools at IHS org and will form a working

499
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,459
group for that of course if they

500
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,740
disagree with you they think that

501
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,320
problems already solved they think you

502
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,210
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> got an adequate community</font>

503
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,340
together it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have other guidance</font>

504
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,080
for you and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we have area</font>

505
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,389
director says to figure that stuff out

506
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:38,389
ah but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's basically the process</font>

507
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay first the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing is not to</font>

508
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,750
have a barber

509
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,730
first thing is to build a community and

510
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:48,600
a bar bought might be part of building

511
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,430
that community but but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

512
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,980
building a community getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

513
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:55,350
discussion going and showing an area

514
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:04,560
director that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we have some valid</font>

515
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:07,050
viable work champion here ah now in the

516
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,980
internet draft some of you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

517
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:14,090
familiar with itu or Upsy processes many

518
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,880
stos talk about contributions coming in

519
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:21,689
and quite often when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i look at itu</font>

520
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,790
contributions or other night rly other

521
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:26,640
contributions that are submitted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:32,510
SEO up standards development

523
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:35,040
organizations heart uh what what the

524
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,930
contribution says is i have an

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:42,030
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem i'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work at</font>

526
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:44,160
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what we're actually looking for</font>

527
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,350
is something more fleshed out that

528
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,920
somebody can read and then respond to

529
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:52,100
and you have a rational discussion about

530
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:59,430
so we're looking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

531
00:27:52,100 --> 00:28:01,500
content in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gaps at the</font>

532
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,930
internet draft is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily a work</font>

533
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:10,020
item you go through i happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

534
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:11,460
directory which I get from you of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

535
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,090
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts that have ever been</font>

536
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:19,260
filed since 1992 which is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

537
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:21,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">crowds I have those on my laptop i sat</font>

538
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:24,330
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and looked at them how many of</font>

539
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,700
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually became RFC's how many of</font>

540
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:30,810
them went through all different steps of

541
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,480
the process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I found was that</font>

542
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:36,090
half of the internet drafts were posted

543
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,640
were literally documents that people

544
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:43,649
just decided to post didn't do anything

545
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,470
further with it all so now think about

546
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:50,070
once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISDN myth I</font>

547
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:52,140
had eight inputs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay those 18 puts</font>

548
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,310
didn't become eight outputs they became

549
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:58,950
two outputs

550
00:28:53,310 --> 00:29:02,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so ah half of all internet drafts</font>

551
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,740
are just documents and that's all they

552
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,360
ever do they go up we talk about them

553
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,000
maybe we don't talk about them they go

554
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,709
away seventy-five percent of

555
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:18,180
internet-drafts do not become RFC's why

556
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:22,030
think about the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i get</font>

557
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:25,090
two or three maybe eight things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

558
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,970
come in and one of the first things that

559
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:31,959
happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> after there's discussion week</font>

560
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:33,580
OOS around some kind of a proposal and

561
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,810
that proposal becomes a working group

562
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:41,050
docket ok be at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I change its</font>

563
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,639
name so the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were before that</font>

564
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,260
will never be RFC is the thing that

565
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,860
became a working group doc has a

566
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,710
different name<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it might become</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

567
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,169
RFC working group might not actually

568
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,450
ultimately publish that might might say

569
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:57,550
well we worked on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> awhile and then</font>

570
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:02,430
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're done we're going to</font>

571
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:05,680
abandon them that then happens ah ah so

572
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:11,620
75% of internet-drafts do not become

573
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:13,360
RFC's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is</font>

574
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,899
the things that we send to the RFC

575
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,850
editor are for archival purposes we want

576
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:24,190
to hang on to them we want to keep them

577
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and now why would they why would</font>

578
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:30,310
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them around do you know</font>

579
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:33,219
what the RFC repository is RFC

580
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:36,520
repository is not a collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

581
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,910
standards it is not a collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

582
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:42,639
white papers it's not a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

583
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:46,390
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things ought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work we have many</font>

584
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in the RFC series that we</font>

585
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,040
explicitly say please don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that or</font>

586
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:54,910
we obviously leader dit we were doing

587
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">something else what the RFC series is is</font>

588
00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:00,940
community memory it allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

589
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember the good to bad and the ugly</font>

590
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully in the future only come up</font>

591
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the gutter</font>

592
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,899
okay its community moment what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

593
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:14,170
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok now what kinds of drafts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

594
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,530
do we have I've already use these terms

595
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:20,380
but let me formalize that we have

596
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:23,860
individual submissions which are simply

597
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:30,340
a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody chose to write all</font>

598
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:32,169
it is uh if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at one kumari because</font>

599
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I didn't want it he wanted to write a</font>

600
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:37,990
draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> describe that in his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

601
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,710
he drops all packets that have been

602
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:44,490
fragmented so Frank he he wrote a draft

603
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:48,040
which is to name his draft kumari

604
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,870
something about fragmenting packets but

605
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:52,629
was never submitted to a working group

606
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:55,719
it eventually got discussed in my

607
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:58,570
working group but uh it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

608
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,690
individual submission came to the IETF

609
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:03,610
and he didn't target a working group why

610
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,170
do people do that well maybe they don't

611
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what working group it should go to</font>

612
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,550
in the first place maybe they just want

613
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,350
to talk about a problem maybe they're

614
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,730
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about building a boss and</font>

615
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:18,040
building a community around it the

616
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:21,220
second set of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is individual</font>

617
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:24,070
submissions to or working group so the

618
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one is draft ma really didn't give</font>

619
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:28,419
me a working group name so i know that

620
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an individual submission if</font>

621
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:34,600
he'd said draft come already be<font color="#E5E5E5"> six hops</font>

622
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:36,670
as working group chair and v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops i</font>

623
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,649
would now pick that up and say i have

624
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,630
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk about something and</font>

625
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,730
I'd actually sent an email to the

626
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,390
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group inviting discussion of</font>

627
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:50,320
that dat da key and if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find their</font>

628
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,960
subsequent discussion uh I might put it

629
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it and agenda it is cus in an ietf</font>

630
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,020
meeting and and eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might have</font>

631
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,510
a working group document come out of

632
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,940
that that's a case where the working

633
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:07,390
group has said this is a problem we're

634
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:09,400
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution is perhaps</font>

635
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,160
not perfect but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the general</font>

636
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:14,880
direction of where I want to go and so

637
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">now let's go through several steps of</font>

638
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,550
refining<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and coming up with</font>

639
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font>

640
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:28,060
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to save and as an</font>

641
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:29,919
archival thing yeah as an RC and maybe

642
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:33,909
we'd like to see implemented in an

643
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:37,780
Internet near us<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so an internet</font>

644
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:40,240
draft its contribution it's intended to

645
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,250
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a substantive contribution not just I</font>

646
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,050
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about something but here's</font>

647
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font>

648
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,879
are the issues here's what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,850
describe it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through a</font>

650
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,650
process in a working group and the

651
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,810
internet draft itself will actually

652
00:33:53,650 --> 00:34:00,460
expire in six months if it's not updated

653
00:33:55,810 --> 00:34:02,290
so if you don't keep it going working

654
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:05,230
group chairs like me will say it you're

655
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">done go away and have you do something</font>

656
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">else now I've called an RFC an archival</font>

657
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,290
document and i'm repeating hear

658
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:16,949
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually said a little bit</font>

659
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:23,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier it is not necessarily a standard</font>

660
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:26,230
often it's just a white paper and what

661
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:29,070
it primarily is this community memory it

662
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,330
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a cute quote</font>

663
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,950
experiences that marvelous thing that

664
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:36,299
allows you to recognize a mistake when

665
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:42,189
you make it again and yes we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

666
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:44,050
we're human beings and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do that ah we</font>

667
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,070
have actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of different</font>

668
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,740
categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> of RFC's some of them we</font>

669
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:56,260
simply say let's not do that anymore we

670
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:57,910
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it historic so ah with routing</font>

671
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:03,940
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the routing information</font>

672
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:05,920
protocol rip RFC 1058 we used that vary

673
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:09,160
widely in the internet for a period of

674
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,920
time and then when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we changed from</font>

675
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:17,049
having Class A Class B Class C addresses

676
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:20,530
to using cider prefix management they do

677
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:23,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIP protocol as defined at the time</font>

678
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:27,060
could no longer work we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

679
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,500
it be a protocol you can't deploy and

680
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,990
what we said was at the

681
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,090
I'm fine let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that thing go</font>

682
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,529
away we think we have better ideas

683
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:40,990
anyway ospf sis let's tell people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

684
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:43,990
two votes and and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

685
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:48,490
make rip go away so we declared rip to

686
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:51,729
be historic ah then subsequently we came

687
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:53,490
up with another rip version 2 and

688
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:56,200
actually made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Skandar doubt of that</font>

689
00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we found that our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

690
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,640
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to use rep that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

691
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:08,140
know bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but okay we'll make that</font>

692
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,960
happen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so we wrote a protocol</font>

693
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:14,650
description for a cider routing

694
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,470
information protocol so certainly we

695
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:20,980
have historic documents documents that

696
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:23,770
we say don't do that ok we have

697
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,570
experimental documents of you could

698
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,360
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire internet it's an</font>

699
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:31,000
experiment that escaped the lab we have

700
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,940
some documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are quite literally</font>

701
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,830
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an experiment you don't want to</font>

702
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,200
do this without touching base with

703
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,240
whoever the author of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

704
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,410
because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be doing something</font>

705
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,640
different you might have learned

706
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:48,759
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow well this has been going</font>

707
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:51,279
on and so you'll find actually quite a

708
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,700
number of documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are that are</font>

709
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,240
literally describing experiments and and

710
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:01,000
this is explicitly dangerous territory

711
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,689
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you know here's an idea we</font>

712
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,550
want to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from it but we aren't yet</font>

713
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,850
at the point of saying you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really think</font>

714
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:13,690
everybody ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this let me give</font>

715
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:17,470
you an example there of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISI in about</font>

716
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:20,590
nineteen ninety-two 1992 came up with a

717
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:24,069
transport protocol something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

718
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,730
but instead of enumerated cats<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

719
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,710
back and forth auroch tape packets going

720
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,200
back and forth and had a acknowledgments

721
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,570
for individual packets would send blocks

722
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,620
of packets and then would get in a

723
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:40,870
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgement saying okay I got</font>

724
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">some packets number this to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I got</font>

725
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,969
these and I didn't get those please

726
00:37:43,089 --> 00:37:49,269
retrains<font color="#CCCCCC"> but those and maybe send me the</font>

727
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:53,499
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> block we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called it where they call</font>

728
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:55,930
it net<font color="#CCCCCC"> blip okay so you'll find some</font>

729
00:37:53,499 --> 00:37:59,109
rfcs there that say here's net blip

730
00:37:55,930 --> 00:38:01,118
here's how it works Brittany I think the

731
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:05,950
author is actually Bob breeding but

732
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:08,559
written by somebody at ISI ah and at the

733
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:13,328
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it he came back and said don't do</font>

734
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:15,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that bad idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't work and he</font>

735
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,369
didn't write in RFC saying please<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

736
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:20,558
do that but if you go ask him about it

737
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:22,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you were doing an experiment I</font>

738
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,969
think it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting experiment</font>

739
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:28,660
could we experiment with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll say</font>

740
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:32,710
none of them go away a bad idea wave up

741
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:35,319
okay so we have historic documents we

742
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,019
have experimental diets we have a lot of

743
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,650
white papers so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned John Nagle's</font>

744
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:44,049
RFC 970 on packets with packet switches

745
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,569
with infinite storage talking about

746
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:49,299
congestion avoidance and developing

747
00:38:46,569 --> 00:38:54,729
first this whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fair queuing</font>

748
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:56,288
or class-based queuing and you know

749
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:58,299
those aren't standards they're not

750
00:38:56,289 --> 00:39:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling anybody what to do or how to do</font>

751
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:06,430
it they're informational and we call

752
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:08,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">them though okay now among standards we</font>

753
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:13,239
use they have three levels in a

754
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:16,058
standards track now we have to the first

755
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:20,529
one we have a document coming out of a

756
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:23,829
working group and we want to say uh we

757
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:27,180
think this works all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience</font>

758
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:31,479
so far says this works give it a whirl

759
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,609
tell us if it works and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

760
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:37,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay will change it will do</font>

761
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:40,109
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you change it ah but</font>

762
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:44,440
then after we've used it for a while

763
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:47,739
then we might say we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it</font>

764
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:53,619
from proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard to standard or</font>

765
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:55,900
internet standard ought to be perfectly

766
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:56,859
honest the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones on proposed</font>

767
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,859
standards

768
00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:02,348
there's most of the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

769
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:05,230
read better standards you'll find our

770
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:07,269
proposed standards and we have a process

771
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we go through the kind of clean</font>

772
00:40:07,269 --> 00:40:12,700
that up and say this is actually works

773
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,799
please do this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through that</font>

774
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:20,618
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> six band working group right now</font>

775
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">with ipv6 RFC 2460 is at proposed</font>

776
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:25,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">standard and we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and</font>

777
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,220
saying we actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

778
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:31,349
standard because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we haven't changed it</font>

779
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:34,808
in approximately forever and it works so

780
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:38,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just do that and so so you'll</font>

781
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:41,710
finally we have an internet draft title

782
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:44,529
is 2460 bits and what we're actually

783
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:48,130
doing in that is removing things that

784
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:50,470
are in 2460 that nobody implemented or

785
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,739
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided didn't work just</font>

786
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:57,970
removing those and then the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

787
00:40:53,739 --> 00:41:02,230
that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

788
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:07,649
that will be at what we call standard we

789
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:09,910
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> processed options hi Scott</font>

790
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:13,150
Scott's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct me on this by</font>

791
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:15,009
the way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have process documents where</font>

792
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:19,989
we go through and say we think people

793
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:23,799
should do this and sometimes we're wrong

794
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:25,809
and we're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say let's not do</font>

795
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:27,609
that but usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've thought this</font>

796
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:30,670
through pretty well we have pretty good

797
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:33,900
notion of why we're recommending it what

798
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:38,730
one might want to do that so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

799
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:42,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have a document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is RFC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 28 27</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

800
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:46,660
second name for the same document is bc

801
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:49,119
p38<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38 says if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a service</font>

802
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:53,589
provider you're offering service to a

803
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:57,039
customer customer has some set of ipv4

804
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:59,799
or ipv6 prefixes that you know that he's

805
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,499
using if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send you packets that don't</font>

806
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:06,038
have those source addresses he's

807
00:42:02,499 --> 00:42:08,769
probably attacking somebody please make

808
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:10,450
them go away just drop those packets

809
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:14,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I</font>

810
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:17,379
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we call a dust print</font>

811
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:22,509
practice sometimes their best proposed

812
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:24,160
practices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

813
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,829
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

814
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,319
this proposed standard and then later it

815
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:31,750
becomes internet standard it's just what

816
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,400
we think people ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and the fact</font>

817
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:37,030
that we think people ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it we</font>

818
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,260
call that a best current practice so

819
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:43,300
what's an RF sink is community memory

820
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,780
it's remembering our mistakes it's

821
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:49,690
remembering the things we did right and

822
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,910
providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> them guidance to service</font>

824
00:42:51,910 --> 00:43:00,240
whoever it is that dedicates not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told</font>

825
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:06,220
you I was going to talk about theory

826
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:11,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now both Einstein and Yogi Berra</font>

827
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:13,270
are quoted attributed to the quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

828
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,189
in theory theory and practice are the

829
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:20,200
same thing in practice they sometimes

830
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:26,680
differ ah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so practice in the</font>

00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:30,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">ITF sometimes differs from theory if I</font>

832
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,598
think about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF process it depends</font>

833
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:38,200
very heavily on goodwill on people

834
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:42,640
acting in a principled and objective

835
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:45,669
manner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ha and doing good planning</font>

836
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,319
and being consistent and what they do if

837
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,140
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job of a working group</font>

838
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,750
chair you want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy to be prettier</font>

839
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,879
than that girl at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

840
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:56,650
predictable you give them a good

00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,609
proposal they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do something</font>

842
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">good with it whatever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ah but</font>

843
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:07,569
you're depending on people people have

844
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,490
all sorts of faults and those particular

845
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:14,380
areas tend to be the things that

846
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:16,689
characterize us<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that happens in the</font>

00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:19,450

were otherwise but

850
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:28,679
like other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we deal with in</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF we generally resolve that in</font>

00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,589
up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem by talking about the</font>

00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:47,069
might literally recall an area director

857
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:49,140
or somebody like that ah or it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

858
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:51,029
that a person who is responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

859
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,098
an area director takes care of several

860
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,929
working groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep working groups it</font>

861
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:56,759
isn't functioning correctly the area

862
00:44:54,929 --> 00:44:59,279
director might come set<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to change</font>

863
00:44:56,759 --> 00:45:01,919
this working group chair working group

864
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:04,469
chair similarly works with internet

865
00:45:01,919 --> 00:45:07,038
draft authors and makes judgment calls

866
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:10,259
about what's going on within

867
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,169
internet-drafts generally speaking we

868
00:45:10,259 --> 00:45:15,380
will have a discussion and figure out

869
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:18,390
what it is we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that I</font>

870
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,299
actually have a situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that in</font>

871
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:25,140
v6 ops right now we're one day<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

872
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:26,699
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it tomorrow and the</font>

873
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,150
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we have a particular</font>

874
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:32,999
internet draft and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors really</font>

875
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,419
think their draft is important they want

876
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:40,218
it to become an RFC and they want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

877
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:45,029
result in changes through a protocol

878
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:48,539
ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they have a consensus</font>

879
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:51,209
around that viewpoint I have another set

880
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:53,309
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that</font>

881
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:55,828
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is essentially</font>

882
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:57,689
operational that well if you wouldn't

883
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:00,209
configure your equipment that way if you

884
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:02,098
figure it the way we told you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

885
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:05,729
wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that problem don't do that</font>

886
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:08,880
I have another set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that are</font>

887
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:11,249
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it yet a third one and so</font>

888
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,519
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the authors of the</font>

889
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:16,140
document their kind of saying you know

890
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,968
Fred I don't think you're operating

891
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:20,549
according to the working group charter I

892
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:24,299
think you're not accomplishing what you

893
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:26,669
should do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> my draft when I put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

894
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:30,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the context of these different focuses</font>

895
00:46:26,669 --> 00:46:33,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">of opinion then it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

896
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:35,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so tomorrow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> morning or tomorrow</font>

897
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:36,058
afternoon we're actually going to have a

898
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,949
discussion

899
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,289
where I've got three different

900
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:43,079
viewpoints in the room and you guys

901
00:46:40,289 --> 00:46:45,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">fight you know you guys Duke it out tell</font>

902
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">me what's going on and what the right</font>

903
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:50,150
outcome should be we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a real</font>

904
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,629
problem we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a problem</font>

905
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:58,400
question is what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right solution ah</font>

906
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:01,589
so when we're when we're dealing with

907
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,099
issues along these lines generally

908
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:07,349
speaking we will find the outcome it

909
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:13,709
gets fixed by talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it and just</font>

910
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:15,959
surfacing all the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let me</font>

911
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:18,479
tell you about me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit I</font>

912
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:21,149
have a number of internet-drafts in the

913
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:23,968
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now some of these will</font>

914
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:31,009
become RFC something probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't okay</font>

915
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:34,349
one of them is in your inbox ah now if

916
00:47:31,009 --> 00:47:38,609
you ever have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of RFC's with</font>

917
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:40,890
your name on them you're crazy let me

918
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:44,609
tell you as someone who does that's a

919
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:47,670
lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay typically an ietf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ER</font>

920
00:47:44,609 --> 00:47:49,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">will have one or two or three that</font>

921
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:52,859
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on or a set of them</font>

922
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:56,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">together these are actually you can see</font>

923
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:59,339
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the names I've got one in</font>

ATM one and ospf 1 and 2 i'm a busy boy

928
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:19,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and seriously this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

929
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:22,049
objective if what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing leads you</font>

930
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:25,198
in that direction go for it you have my

931
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:33,869
sympathy ah but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not an objective</font>

932
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:38,099
this is this is what can help ah in v6

933
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:40,529
ox right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have two documents that</font>

934
00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:45,539
are in the process of being worked on by

935
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:47,999
the RFC editor and will i if my

936
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:49,560
co-author ever responds to the RFC

937
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:53,459
editor one of them will become

938
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:58,170
RFC right then<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah two of them are</font>

939
00:48:53,460 --> 00:49:00,030
involved in IETF iesg discussion four of

940
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,130
them are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually working you breast and</font>

941
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:03,630
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another seven individual</font>

942
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,480
submissions that have come into the

943
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:09,380
working group because somebody wanted to

944
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about whatever that topic was ah</font>

945
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:15,660
what we've actually done with those four

946
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,910
of these individual submissions we've

947
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,850
shifted this sunset for in different

948
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:22,920
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group and the thing was that we</font>

949
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,259
actually invited those documents and

950
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,380
then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a discussion between two</font>

951
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:31,230
working groups and sunset four chairs

952
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,700
came back to be six<font color="#E5E5E5"> ops and said we</font>

953
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,280
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work should go on and are</font>

954
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:40,049
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay shifted to work off to them</font>

955
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,760
ah we have one submission that has no

956
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,190
discussion nobody said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

957
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,500
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it nobody's interested in</font>

958
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,910
I'm not going to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on an agenda we</font>

959
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:50,000
have two others<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are on the agenda</font>

960
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:54,569
tomorrow morning or tomorrow afternoon

961
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so looking at v6 ops from through</font>

962
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:00,180
the eyes of a working group chair we

963
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:03,529
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> have kind of a variety of things</font>

964
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,879
moving through the working group ah and

965
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:09,690
you know a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

966
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,460
discussions so expect that that's likely

967
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:15,150
to happen in whatever working group

968
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:17,880
you're working in and and understand

969
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:20,970
that the chair unless it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a bad</font>

970
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,190
chair the chair is trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

971
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:27,990
right thing happen for your draft the

972
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:30,000
right thing might be to kill it the

973
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:33,629
right thing might be to say this draft

974
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:36,330
isn't going anywhere or they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to</font>

975
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:38,850
say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to merge this with this other</font>

976
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,710
draft and by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have comment on</font>

977
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:43,529
mailing list that says and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

978
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">do some other things as well and I'd</font>

979
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull that together into a common</font>

980
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:52,950
draft that actually addresses more of

981
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:55,500
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> or there might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be other</font>

982
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:57,240
outcomes but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you're working</font>

983
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,750
group chair is generally dealing with

984
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,060
and is trying to make something happen

985
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:07,280
so when you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there kind of</font>

986
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:10,290
I posted my draft where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my RFC number</font>

987
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,390
that's what's going on so welcome to the

988
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,580
IETF this is the process that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

989
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:20,879
through now where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we with respect to</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes worth of additional</font>

992
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:31,140
slides why am i involved in the IETF why

993

have I been here for 27 years yes I've

00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,970
you want to have an interoperable

1017
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:41,370
network and have customers be able to go

1018
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:42,799

1022
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:54,030
so yeah we're a community and sometimes

1023
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:56,820
we can be a little hard to get along

1024
00:52:54,030 --> 00:53:00,380
with I'm sorry that's that's just true

1025
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:03,660
ah but think about how do you make a

1026
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,850
difference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your community at home you</font>

know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your neighborhood you can make</font>

1028
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,299
it a better neighborhood you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make it</font>

1029
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,420
a worse neighborhood by how much trash

1030
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,850
you leave in Pierre yard by how how late

1031
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,680
you stay up with loud music on you know

1032
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,069
how do you deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your</font>

1033
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:22,950
neighbors are frankly the things that

1034
00:53:20,069 --> 00:53:25,140
you do at home to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a difference in</font>

1035
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:27,359
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> community are the same things that</font>

1036
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,980
you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear you want to be</font>

1037
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,650
constructive if you want to make useful

1038
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:34,710
comments you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make proposals that</font>

1039

toward that goal making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet be</font>
