heads up that the were several changes

to the structure of the document as well

<font color="#E5E5E5">as a small changes to the content of the</font>

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,770
only remaining due to an editorial

143
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:31,379

ID has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for working group</font>

288
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,289
adoption that's the draft on a tour to

289
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:52,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">eleven mapping to this sir so we won't</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read this draft please add</font>

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,899
it to your reading list please have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

293
00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:03,970
look at it we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to receive comments</font>

294
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:06,248
and feedback after that rather long and

295
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,899
working group<font color="#E5E5E5"> chairs summary we can now</font>

296
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:11,889
move on to the dress sctp drafts first

297
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:14,789
Michael are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to tell us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

298
00:21:11,889 --> 00:21:14,789
stream schedules

299
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is about a document which is</font>

300
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:45,090
um about a new data chunk and last part

301
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:47,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it it's about this um it is important</font>

302
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,928
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that the web RTC working</font>

303
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:53,730
group is so waiting for this and that's

304
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:58,320
why it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only on their list of important</font>

305
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:00,480
things for us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> finish so this is the</font>

306
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">status we have version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five of the</font>

307
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,730
document out we at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to</font>

308
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:13,770
address all issues I was aware of i

309
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:15,990
added a description of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stream scheduling</font>

310
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:19,918
so the document is about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new data</font>

311
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,230
chunk and stream schedulers and this new

312
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,590
data chunk allows additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedulers</font>

313
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:29,580
so um the scheduler concept is new and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

314
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,260
have put into figures and a bit of text

315
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,928
to explain what these schedulers are

316
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,760
about this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised by</font>

317
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:37,799
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people reading the document</font>

318
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,080
saying we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand what</font>

319
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:45,270
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so can you have</font>

320
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:48,149
some explanation of that and arm yeah so

321
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,340
up to that it was fine and you submitted

322
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> karen who's reading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:57,330
document pretty detailed has already

324
00:22:54,990 --> 00:23:03,409
given some comments and we have

325
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:05,490
discussed them and we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more</font>

326
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:12,750
improvements to the document which are

327
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:14,460
basically cleanups so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday and</font>

328
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:18,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sunday there was a hackathon and we use</font>

329
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:21,450
that to actually get some running code

330
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:24,210
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some let's say existing</font>

331
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">code it's now running at least most of</font>

332
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:30,229
the times and

333
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:33,469
found a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues in the sense of</font>

334
00:23:30,229 --> 00:23:39,729
a couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not clearly</font>

335
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:42,589
described in the document and one is how

336
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:47,149
whether the I mean the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

337
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:49,219
document is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TSN field</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

338
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:53,208
for doing reliable transfers and not

339
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:54,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">also for reassembly anymore and um there</font>

340
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:58,309
is no statement that the receiver

341
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,729
shouldn't actually not look at the TSN

342
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:05,059
to do any kind of reassembly and we want

343
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:07,219
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that clear and it's also now</font>

344
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:10,969
that the sender can use an opportunity

345
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:12,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">ascend sequence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh he must ah he can do</font>

346
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:14,449
it in a way that it blows up a receiver

347
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:16,399
he could do it with the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack</font>

348
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:18,859
already but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put in the</font>

349
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:21,978
sentence saying if you do you should

350
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:25,698
assign the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TSN's in a in a way that a</font>

351
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:28,509
receiver can progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will provide as</font>

352
00:24:25,699 --> 00:24:32,119
an example of where method which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

353
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:35,089
which may enjoy us that but if receiver

354
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:37,039
as sender can do otherwise we haven't

355
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:39,559
done the statement of how the i-40

356
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,759
ascension is negotiated we did this in

357
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,239
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code and we figured out we need a</font>

358
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:47,209
sentence for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need text that the</font>

359
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:48,979
i-40 SN is only used when you use I data

360
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:52,399
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use novel data chance to use</font>

361
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:54,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward essentials and we have an API</font>

362
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,349
issue on the receiver side which wasn't

363
00:24:54,319 --> 00:25:01,309
clear and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what we want to do is</font>

364
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:04,009
um we keep it as simple as possible for

365
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:08,709
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not allowing an arbitrary</font>

366
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:11,539
flexibility but to arm to allow that

367
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:14,539
functionality what the web RTC guards

368
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:17,119
needs and this keeps things as simple as

369
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:23,419
possible if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want more you can edit</font>

370
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:27,738
locally it's an avi issue next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so</font>

371
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:30,679
what's to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do ah address Curren comments</font>

372
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:33,039
address the issues we had most of them

373
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,499
are editorial shoot so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

374
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,769
question so far what one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks to</font>

375
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:41,830
address

376
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:44,200
see of possibly SMS comes up with

377
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:55,989
comments before or during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working</font>

378
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:57,820
group mascot questions when do you

379
00:25:55,989 --> 00:26:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect the document to ready for wooden</font>

380
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:06,009
group must call making have it ready and

381
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:10,408
let's say two weeks if that is so maybe

382
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:13,509
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should ask who's read this document I</font>

383
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:15,100
know there's quite hair ended with with

384
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">Karen including sign of currents</font>

385
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,719
comments and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question will</font>

386
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,659
be is anybody going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read this and</font>

387
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,859
could provide some comments on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so my</font>

388
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:28,419
first question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you please</font>

389

390
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:37,269
some way if you've read this or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent</font>

391
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:39,689
version of this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I know</font>

392
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:44,859
some of the remote participants hug and

393

411
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,710
the next presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

412
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:04,170
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am again and marooned from a range</font>

413
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:06,570
so I will not pretend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an sctp</font>

414
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,730
expert I'm not even sure what is this

415
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,929
protocol that Santa<font color="#E5E5E5"> curiam pure client</font>

416
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:16,770
from a protocol point of view because

417
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:18,000
diameter is running over sctp and also

418
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,700
from an approach to point of view

419
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,440
because we need to to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for in</font>

420
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,300
different environments so next night

421
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:30,770
please so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in the current</font>

422
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:35,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">version of the sctp years back we have</font>

423
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">section 15th at least a number of</font>

424
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:43,199
recommended values for setp protocol

425
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:48,570
parameters and this list is commonly

426
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:51,929
used my sctp stack implementers as a way

427
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:55,320
to identify a set of parameters that can

428
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:58,080
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured by the network operator so</font>

429
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,389
and part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this list and actually it is</font>

430
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,260
some feedback that we receive from under

431
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,150
sink that for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sec delay is</font>

432
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,920
not taken into account in some

433
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,960
implementation and feedback received

434
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,679
from the vendor is to say but it's not

435
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:16,290
supposed to be part of but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

436
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:19,800
these back is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resume so one example</font>

437
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:21,480
here is a code from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the spec saying</font>

438
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,178
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that need to be</font>

439
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,390
configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least you should be</font>

440
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:35,550
able to configure this parameter next

441
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide yeah so so we had this discussion</font>

442
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:41,159
may be internally with different vendors

443
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,280
for maybe now two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years so I suppose to</font>

444
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,990
to create a draft and to submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

445
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,990
draft into to have a clear description

446
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:53,790
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this group so the word proposed</font>

447
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:56,610
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> update the specification to</font>

448
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,440
indicate that the sag delay is a

449
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,939
parameter<font color="#E5E5E5"> that need to be configured and</font>

450
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,610
we

451
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,650
or slower given the recommended value

452
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:08,840
that is already in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spec to say that</font>

453
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:12,260
it is it should be 200 millisecond so

454
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:15,169
why the<font color="#CCCCCC"> widest approach it because if</font>

455
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,670
you update you will not obsolete<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

456
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:19,430
existing one but you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a clear</font>

457
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:20,810
int for the implementer for the

458
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,080
implementers to know that the recent

459
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,280
thing new and this kind of

460
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,960
clarifications cannot be seen as a

461
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">errata because there is nothing wrong</font>

462
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:38,150
except that the the table in the section

463
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:40,430
15 is not up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to date next please so we</font>

464
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,980
have a questions actually it is this

465
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:46,130
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm assuming that we are</font>

466
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,890
addressing an existing issue because I

467
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,560
we received internally and also on the

468
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:58,430
mailing list feedback think that this

469
00:30:51,560 --> 00:31:00,889
issue exists and about updating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

470
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:04,610
draft i think the specification i think

471
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right way to do that just to</font>

472
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:10,429
clearly indicate that it is some things

473
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,140
that need to be configured<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

474
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,610
we are clarifying to two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

475
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,860
drafts things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a set of</font>

476
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:19,240
parameters that need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> configured</font>

477
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:23,570
and also the value recommended<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

478
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,060
configure parameters and so the question

479
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:27,260
raised in tone by<font color="#E5E5E5"> michael was that is</font>

480
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:33,639
there something that need to be merged

481
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,640
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current setp updates a draft</font>

482
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,600
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

483
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,649
were the triggers to be in it if it was

484
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,850
on only a collector of existing Loretta

485
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,410
for instance or known issues it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was for</font>

486
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:51,199
documented for wine this one was not

487
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:53,120
present for instance and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing</font>

488
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,440
that we won't find an<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator point of</font>

489
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,000
view to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something where it is</font>

490
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,610
clearly indicated that you need to

491
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,510
configure it whatever the whatever the

492
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution and we don't want to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

493
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:08,629
two years again so I don't know what

494
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:12,200
would be the the the the future of this

495
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,690
draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> sctp date so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be</font>

496
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,190
in

497
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,250
in both directions things that you could

498
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:18,650
have a standalone one just updating to

499
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:21,150
say that this information is a

500
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,890
configurable and after that if you have

501
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:27,770
a beast<font color="#E5E5E5"> version it will capture any way</font>

502
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:32,400
any updates of the 49 60s specification

503
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:36,030
so if not if it is something ready and<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font>

504
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:41,340
and so on so now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

505
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:43,080
so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in equation reaction or</font>

506
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,240
maybe the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment is I think this</font>

507
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">just for within the charge of the things</font>

508
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,270
we do in this working group so thank you

509
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:53,370
very much Michael mycotoxin um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

510
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:58,500
this address is an editorial on RC 4

511
00:32:53,370 --> 00:33:00,060
e960 it's no question um they<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggestion</font>

512
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,460
I made is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on a</font>

513
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:07,379
document collecting all the editorial

514
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:10,470
things we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve in 4960 and we</font>

515
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,510
can include that so it's it's up to you

516
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:17,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you want to get that included if you</font>

517
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:21,690
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to take this in how that</font>

518
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">document will progress we will see i</font>

519
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,290
mean i will ask in a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

520
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:28,410
were working with a double that and we

521
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:32,070
want to progress that so at least in the

522
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:36,810
past it was possible for an operator to

523
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:38,550
say here let's have a look we have 4960

524
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,980
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the ITF is working on an</font>

525
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,110
update it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group document the</font>

526
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,940
issue is listed there so yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

527
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:50,459
something um it worked on the past and

528
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,320
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you can also i mean if you really</font>

529
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,840
as an operator need to talk to vendors

530
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,689
um and the results on etsy specification

531
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,770
which tells you which parameters must be

532
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:05,910
configurable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got it right</font>

533
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:08,219
there but on my point of view it's an

534
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:11,820
offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> too if you agree we can put this</font>

535
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:16,529
into the base document and it will come

536
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:20,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">up when it comes up hmm i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that as</font>

537
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:21,960
I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just want well sure that we</font>

538
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">will have something soon so under things</font>

539
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,659
that we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> means in few months that</font>

540
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,859
I

541
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:29,399
want to have something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

542
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:33,359
what is a process usually to update 4960

543
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:36,808
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> see I don't want to spend three years</font>

544
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,250
on trying to update an existing protocol

545
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:40,649
and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know what is nearly</font>

546
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:42,089
ongoing consensus on the year update<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

547
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:43,828
instance that will be discussed anyway

548
00:34:42,089 --> 00:34:45,299
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let me comment on the</font>

549
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:47,819
process and see if Michaels got a

550
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:49,409
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my committee and the</font>

551
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:51,299
intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> here was to do an</font>

552
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,210
informational document that we publish

553
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:58,170
relatively soon that defines the exact

554
00:34:54,210 --> 00:35:00,380
text changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to 49 16 so in</font>

555
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:03,329
effect this would be published as an RFC

556
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:05,640
relatively soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as that list is</font>

557
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:07,049
stable I suggest that that might

558
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,490
actually be in the same sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

559
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:10,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame is publishing any other document</font>

560
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,660
in the idea it's just an informational

561
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,660
document it doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through a</font>

562
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,020
huge lot of extra procedures to get that

563
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,000
published the update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 4960 is a little</font>

564
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,130
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated this is a document</font>

565
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,069
that people rely upon it's a fundamental

566
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,260
spec here so that update will take

567
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:30,329
slightly longer it will go through more

568
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,859
rigorous review although of course we

569
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:34,170
will already have a change list because

570
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:36,270
we have the informational document that

571
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,119
process will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take longer to produce the</font>

572
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:41,038
new replacement for 4960 and it's

573
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,289
important that when we think about this

574
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,119
to classify whether the changes we're

575
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:47,160
talking about here are corrections and

576
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,319
amendments based on experience or the

577
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,200
addition of new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font>

578
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:55,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">a correction based on experience to the</font>

579
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,000
text and therefore it qualifies well to

580
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:58,740
fit within both of those documents the

581
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,279
immediate informational under later

582
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,558
update should the group take it yeah

583
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:07,020
just just just on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's</font>

584
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things that worm is the</font>

585
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,220
fact that you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to rely on</font>

586
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">an informational RFC so from an ITF</font>

587
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,160
point of view it's okay you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it</font>

588
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,349
is and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something available and you</font>

589
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,109
can rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a discussion</font>

590
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:21,960
with a vendor is different you think

591
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:24,480
that just as for for the time being it

592
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not so clear so we can understand</font>

593
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that may not be in</font>

594
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,359
a very good so it was a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at</font>

595
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,250
least the proposal to date one but as I

596
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,140
said it's an ongoing discussion snow

597
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:41,309
maker please um

598
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:46,680
can you go back a slide and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

599
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:51,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">a slot I thought you said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's if you</font>

600
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,848
can't find an errata is that so you said

601
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,059
you want something soon you can bring to

602
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:59,640
the vendors I have no problem in if

603
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:02,789
someone fights<font color="#E5E5E5"> an errata saying there is</font>

604
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,558
a missing line of text in this I'm not

605
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if Randy is paying attention right</font>

606
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:09,480
now but if I would be the guy who was

607
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked if it's okay at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

608
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,289
yes so then you have an approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> arata</font>

609
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:20,009
of an existing document which enough to

610
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:22,769
go to a vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah the caveat</font>

611
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,619
there being that we when we approve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

612
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:29,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">errata has to be not a change to the</font>

613
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,039
text simply a correction of language but

614
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:39,180
and I it's a missing line of text it's

615
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:42,390
nira Torrio thing yet Randy agrees I who

616
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:47,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">is asked for quite crude Narada who has</font>

617
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:51,480
been asked for approving an errata the

618
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:56,160
ad so what the ad with what the ad of

619
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:58,589
the day send a proposal for an errata

620
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,118
and let's see and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that</font>

621
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:01,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be approved it does not might be a</font>

622
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,859
stepping stone to get an even quicker

623
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:07,380
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yep in that case so I</font>

624
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,900
would propose to do that Anna so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

625
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:12,180
check with you Michael also<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it is</font>

626
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,930
zeroth is fine for us and we can we can

627
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,558
also add this to the informational draft

628
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:21,629
so drunk for<font color="#E5E5E5"> air informational RFC</font>

629
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,730
listing these see updates possible

630
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:27,390
updates that document contains all

631
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:32,339
currently approved doradas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

632
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:34,730
okay thank you great thank you I'm I

633
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:39,599
suspect it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael again isn't it Oh</font>

634
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:42,539
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subject of the rotters exactly</font>

635
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,369
about this document um yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

636
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:47,690
draft we started I don't know a couple

637
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:50,309
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago I'm collecting</font>

638
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:55,260
so basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a couple of aratus</font>

639
00:38:50,309 --> 00:39:01,010
not that many fight for the RFC 4960 but

640
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:05,040
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our from erickson a couple of</font>

641
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:07,589
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> with have with the dock with the</font>

642
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,369
RFC 4960 which results in interrupt

643
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:14,460
problems so we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's might be</font>

644
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:18,900
good to collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the known aratus with</font>

645
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:25,770
the issues which have been reported<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

646
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:27,869
a document so the status is on that we

647
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,420
have the second version we have 32

648
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:33,809
issues we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dealt with in this</font>

649
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">document um for each issue we have a</font>

650
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:39,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">section it says this is the old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text IRC</font>

651
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,520
4960 this is the proposed new texts on

652
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:44,400
earth but for the best document and

653
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,640
these are the reasons for the change so

654
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,140
you can go line by line understand what

655
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be the changes of the document and</font>

656
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:57,170
understand what the changes us so this

657
00:39:53,609 --> 00:40:00,480
will be once the best RFC has been

658
00:39:57,170 --> 00:40:03,390
published<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a list of changes and</font>

659
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,520
why they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so you can if you</font>

660
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:06,990
have another I've seen 4960 compliant

661
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,660
implementation and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

662
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,089
you have the future are the future

663
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,819
number compliant<font color="#CCCCCC"> in limitation you can</font>

664
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:18,359
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the Delta listing and see</font>

665
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:20,700
what it is the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't complete</font>

666
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:22,619
we use an issue tracker on github if we

667
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,460
have new issues we put it there and

668
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:29,339
discuss their<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow the changes so</font>

669
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:34,130
that you have some history<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm and we</font>

670
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:38,009
have 18 issues to go arm and then um

671
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:41,400
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm 18 issues we know are now</font>

672
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:43,559
offered possibly a couple of them are

673
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:51,660
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think maxim had one</font>

674
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:54,230
additional um<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now yeah that's it</font>

675
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,230
so

676
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,870
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

677
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,950
pulled that and sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an email saying</font>

678
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,140
i was going to pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the github</font>

679
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,120
and just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide okay just</font>

680
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,589
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can see that actually they can</font>

681
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,120
pull it as well this this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

682
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,520
closed process you can look at what

683
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,259
these lists are and got to get heaven

684
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually find all the little tricky bits</font>

685
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,040
that go with it yes so and it's nice

686
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you give a presentation you didn't</font>

687
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,950
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this list</font>

688
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:26,440
but i think that doesn't make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

689
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some of them are pretty easy to</font>

690
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchanges some of them are required to a</font>

691
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,080
deep understanding of the protocol

692
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:38,140
mechanisms like this issue with action

693
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,670
be of table to Russell if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

694
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,370
subject that means you really have to

695
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:46,470
think about this are three times at

696
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:51,339
least other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like ICMP</font>

697
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:53,410
feedback that kind of stuff but there's

698
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,410
also something like in like remove<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

699
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">name parameter which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have a single</font>

700
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:02,710
parameter in the st specification which

701
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:06,340
hasn't been tested in an interoperable

702
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:10,780
way right now so when we have in mind

703
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,700
moving from proposed then two more to

704
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,590
another state we have to remove this so

705
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:19,359
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we will deal with in</font>

706
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:21,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document so to do um yeah deal with</font>

707
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:25,200
the issues we know off deal with the

708
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,810
issues which come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> are as discussed if</font>

709
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,950
it's acceptable by by you we can add

710
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:34,840
this issue there and we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

arm start the process on that document

720
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,380
mmm

721
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:17,619
questions on the talk could I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group adoption</font>

726
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:45,339
comes up and this would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

727
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,630
of a shocker had we not mention this on

728
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:50,650
previous and working group meetings and

729
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,210
previous working group meetings we'd

730
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,500
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked how many people were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">following this and where this was the</font>

732
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:59,290
correct process so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to formally</font>

733
00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:02,529
call a working group adoption for this

out previously in TS<font color="#CCCCCC"> bwg meetings the</font>

739
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,740
intention is to document all<font color="#CCCCCC"> arata all</font>

740
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:23,470
corrections to the document and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then to</font>

open the document for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a best revision if</font>

742
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:35,348
you think this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that tsv WG</font>

743
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:37,180
should do can you please hum now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font>

744
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:41,170
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a thing that we should</font>

745
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:49,089
not do now in TS VW g for some reason

746
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:50,500
please hum no I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as support for</font>

747
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:53,200
moving forward for working group

748
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,849
adoption we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> repeat this on the</font>

749
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,669
mailing list to capture the people who

750
00:44:54,849 --> 00:45:07,180
are not present in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

751
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:11,020
you that speaker is going to be you

752
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:13,270
again on random pattern who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

753
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,230
be the next speaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will talk about s</font>

754
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,490
City<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget</font>

755
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:20,130
yeah this is how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document which is</font>

756
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:23,819
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> older than on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

757
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:25,820
about svi data and it's not completely

758
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,850
finished yet the reason is about

759
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:33,030
priorities we use to assign our cycle

760
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:39,779
student they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the I data document</font>

761
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:42,960
ah right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the status of</font>

762
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft it's the eighth revision of a</font>

763
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,460
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this working group it's</font>

764
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:49,589
actually a bit longer it's actually a

765
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:54,000
bit older because it goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a time</font>

766
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:55,890
where we had behaved working group and

767
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have it we had a document there and</font>

768
00:45:55,890 --> 00:46:00,569
document here and it was split and merge

769
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:02,640
so it has some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history well we</font>

770
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:09,150
have a single document are now which

771
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:12,680
describes how a net implementation for

772
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:16,530
sctp should look I could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like um</font>

773
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:19,529
and it's technically complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in</font>

774
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:22,980
the past there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wish to do some</font>

775
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:31,490
editorial changes um and these have to

776
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:34,530
be done so what is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this about</font>

777
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:37,259
basically you have an errant nap so you

778
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:41,030
can change on a packet the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address or</font>

779
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:43,290
the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and port number and</font>

780
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,780
changing the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the port</font>

781
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:48,240
number has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in case of</font>

782
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing because all the power and</font>

783
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,560
endpoint is a list of IP addresses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

784
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:56,630
sink and has only a single port number

785
00:46:52,560 --> 00:47:00,299
so you can't um change the port number

786
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:05,190
independently<font color="#E5E5E5"> on multiple paths so we</font>

787
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:06,690
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a way of doing net for sctp</font>

788
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,180
which means we don't change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port</font>

789
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,400
number but which gives you almost the

790
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:15,720
service you get from nap so you can

791
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:19,290
handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> two nodes behind an ad talking to</font>

792
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,810
the same server choosing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensuring</font>

793
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:24,000
the same local port number so you run

794
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:25,990
into a part number collision but we can

795
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,510
resolve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we do this</font>

796
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:30,368
by a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea we have a connect and</font>

797
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:34,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Association identifier or connection</font>

798
00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:36,340
identifier and we use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw spots the</font>

799
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,169
short part at the part number sent the

800
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:42,490
verification tag for that this gives us

801
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:44,860
forty six bits of random data which is

802
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,560
good enough it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not perfect we deal</font>

803
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:51,820
with the collision case but um it helps

804
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:55,500
in almost all cases this means<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ad</font>

805
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:58,570
box does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to change the packet</font>

806
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,760
the sctp packet it can change the IP

807
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:04,240
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the IV had about nothing</font>

808
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:07,420
inside the acidity back and it needs

809
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,600
support for inside the net box and in

810
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:15,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end point so we'll both have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

811
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:19,600
something so this what's still to do um

812
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:21,610
the suggestion for the improvement is we

813
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,180
have currently one section describing

814
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:28,350
the procedures and it tells you how this

815
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">works and the suggestion was to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> split it</font>

816
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:34,450
for what has a net<font color="#CCCCCC"> implemented to do and</font>

817
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,299
was at what has an endpoint implemented

818
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:39,220
to do so that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

819
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand everything if you only want</font>

820
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:44,129
to implement the net part or if you only

821
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:47,950
want to implement the endpoint part and

822
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:49,480
this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to move text</font>

823
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:51,279
around make sure that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

824
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,010
self-contained if you only read this

825
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,109
section we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lots of examples of</font>

826
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,570
message flows in there we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that</font>

827
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:00,910
intertwine because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what</font>

828
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:03,790
an endpoint sense how it influences in

829
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:09,549
that box and so on the other point was

830
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:11,710
which was brought up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an earlier IETF</font>

831
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,980
meeting in a discussion was that we

832
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:18,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">currently use only ipv4 it we give</font>

833
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:20,080
concrete examples with IP addresses in

834
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we only translate</font>

835
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,810
before addresses to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> for addresses but</font>

836
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:28,509
you can so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not there's no</font>

837
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:31,960
limitation in this in this procedures

838
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,109
that you can't do v62 v6 translation or

839
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:39,180
before 36 / 62 before so other

840
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:42,089
suggestion was to it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially as</font>

841
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:44,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mention that you can do be 62 before</font>

842
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:47,369
translation or vice versa so having an

843
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,010
example to which shows this should be

844
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:52,260
added or can be down this is basically

845
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,510
what needs to be done implementation

846
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,380
status I think the middle box stuff is

847
00:49:54,510 --> 00:50:00,990
mostly implemented in the freebsd net

848
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,869
stuff the endpoint implementation is

849
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:06,180
partly around previously so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

850
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:11,069
some there are some experience with the

851
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:13,348
implementation that's the status quick

852
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:15,359
comment from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chair can you make sure</font>

853
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the v6 example appears in a</font>

854
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,990
separate subsection so it's really clear

855
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,049
to those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review the</font>

856
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:24,839
final document<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we can make rectal</font>

857
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:32,160
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anybody have any comments on</font>

858
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:33,930
this particular project there were

859
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,230
questions when this document was

860
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:39,899
resurrected about whether it should be

861
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:42,569
continued in the idea it based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

862
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision to more or less not support</font>

863
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">nearing not what for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 but I personally</font>

864
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,299
think that this work has been started<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

865
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:55,319
long time ago it starting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> behaved</font>

866
00:50:51,299 --> 00:50:58,410
working group and my own take on that

867
00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:00,450
would be that this document is a product

868
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:02,609
of that process that's originated a

869
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,109
while ago and we should continue it if

870
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:05,940
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on this please</font>

871
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel free to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so but please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

872
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,160
within the working group now so that we

873
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,500
have a clear consensus if you have any

874
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns about it wishing a not document</font>

875
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:26,069
at this time please say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I don't</font>

876
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">further comments when will the document</font>

877
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:31,079
be ready it's on our milestones list you

878
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:35,040
had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like September on your</font>

00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:38,520
list mm-hmm which<font color="#CCCCCC"> sons do ever so it's</font>

880
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:40,460
doable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's good not sure if</font>

881
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,819
someone will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to present it in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">South Korea</font>

883
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:56,460
okay nuts document done tell us about

884
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:58,110
encapsulation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what one year I want</font>

885
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,210
to consider additionally into what

886
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:02,880
you've already considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

887
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:05,730
about a UDP encapsulation we have an RFC

888
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,150
about their this is this started as a

889
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:12,930
document for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with legacy nets</font>

890
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:14,310
which don't support this fancy algorithm

891
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,899
we described in the other document on

892
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:19,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one hand side and on the other hand</font>

893
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:22,290
side on how you can deal with sctp

894
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:25,640
implementations are when you don't have

895
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:28,950
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a raw socket so you can't send</font>

896
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:33,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">asset V packets so these were the two</font>

897
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:38,370
reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simply encapsulate sctp in</font>

898
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:41,670
UDP and there's an RC described it's

899
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:48,359
obviously 69 51 and to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a very</font>

900
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:50,970
short way of doing this is that when you

901
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:54,090
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to encapsulate a packet into a UDP</font>

902
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,859
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> STD packet into a UDP packet you</font>

903
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically have to insert the UDP source</font>

904
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:00,570
and destination port numbers so that's

905
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,970
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I call here</font>

906
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:05,790
and capsulate what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call here</font>

907
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:08,549
encapsulation behavior means whether i

908
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:11,009
do encapsulation or not so i can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

909
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,990
over UDP or natively and if I

910
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,000
encapsulate<font color="#E5E5E5"> I must know my own part</font>

911
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:18,299
number and the destination port number

912
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:20,910
so an sctp stack has a single own port

913
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:23,730
number that's local encapsulation port

914
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,730
number that's configured that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

915
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:29,220
problem so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sending a packet I</font>

916
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,860
need to figure out should I<font color="#CCCCCC"> n should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

917
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:34,439
send it over UDP or natively and if I

918
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,300
send it over UDP what is the destination

919
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,630
port number that's the remote

920
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:44,460
encapsulation point and that RFC's laid

921
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:47,790
out in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just learns on what</font>

922
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,160
part number is used by the pier so when

923
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,890
it gets my window the pier sends a

924
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,040
packet that source port number can be

925
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:58,589
translated by net boxes and I just see

926
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,190
oh my p a-- uses that point so whenever

927
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,319
I

928
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:04,530
send a packet to him I used that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

929
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:06,750
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that can change over time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

930
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,940
the sctp said we'll just adopt so

931
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:12,109
whenever it receives a packet it

932
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:14,490
verifies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it really belongs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

933
00:54:12,109 --> 00:54:17,040
Association and if that check is

934
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:19,500
performed it updates this remote

935
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,259
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> port and it can also turn</font>

936
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,420
on or off capsulation so you can start

937
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:29,040
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kept sedated and switch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

938
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:32,069
to native if you want to so our c69 51

939
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,240
states that you must do this update of

940
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:38,430
the behavior after first when you

941
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,828
receive a packet look up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association</font>

942
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:43,589
and once you've found it the look at the

943
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:45,890
verification tag you expect and ensure

944
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:49,319
that is the verification tag you got

945
00:54:45,890 --> 00:55:01,049
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means an off path attacker can't do</font>

946
00:54:49,319 --> 00:55:06,359
any harm looks like there's missing the

947
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:09,980
slide here<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm what do you want there</font>

948
00:55:06,359 --> 00:55:14,339
was a slide the issue and the issue says

949
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:16,859
two things are are missing one is what

950
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:19,950
do you do with packets which are out of

951
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:22,680
the blue because you can't check you

952
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:25,339
don't find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association you can't do</font>

953
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this check and the other question is</font>

954
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:30,869
what if you receive a packet with an

955
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:33,960
inner<font color="#E5E5E5"> chalk packets with any chance have</font>

956
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:36,290
the verification text 0 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find</font>

957
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Association but you can't do the</font>

958
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:45,720
verification tech tech that's not

959
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:47,700
mentioned in the RFC so that's where the

960
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,250
solution comes in which is proposed here

961
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:52,078
and for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the loop packets it's</font>

962
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,819
very simple so if you get a packet and

963
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,819
you don't find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Association we call</font>

964
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:59,400
this out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue and if you have to</font>

965
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:01,290
send response packet then you just

966
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:03,960
reflect the behavior so it was received

967
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:06,690
natively you answer natively it was

968
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,849
received and capsulated 08 / UDP you

969
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,760
respond over UDP and exchange source and

970
00:56:08,849 --> 00:56:14,730
destination node simple thing

971
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,130
what's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that simple is if packets</font>

972
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:19,110
come in with the inner child then you

973
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:22,080
have the verification tag of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero but</font>

974
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">you find an association and nothing is</font>

975
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,450
mentioned in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document what you have</font>

976
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is you don't update your</font>

977
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:30,990
encapsulation behavior for that

978
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">association so if you're running</font>

979
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:35,700
natively you keep natively if you're

980
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:39,420
running over UDP don't change the remote

981
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:42,240
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> port then look what the</font>

982
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,020

983

<font color="#CCCCCC">same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encapsidation method so if you are</font>

association<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he only has to own</font>

997
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:27,840
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address but he doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

998
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,700
to own the same port number also so if

999
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,980
you have a userland stack on that note a

1000
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,259
different user lands deck on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1001
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,750
node can start and can take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1002
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">association so that's why you have to do</font>

1003
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff done right and it's just</font>

1004
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">not specified so it's not wrong Morton</font>

1005
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,610
it's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROC DRC mrs. this edge case</font>

1006
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:51,360
there is a limitation and the limitation

1007
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:53,190
is if a node sends an<font color="#E5E5E5"> init in the middle</font>

1008
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,430
of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> association this is the note has</font>

1009
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:58,980
restarted so he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue an</font>

1010
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,020
association<font color="#E5E5E5"> but for example crashed in</font>

1011
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:04,080
the middle of that he can't change his

1012
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:06,300
UDP encapsulation behavior for that but

1013
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,690
that's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal the whole idea of</font>

1014
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,510
a restart is to continue the<font color="#CCCCCC"> association</font>

1015
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:15,390
without any change<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's just a force</font>

1016
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:17,490
if it was using before a UDP port has to

1017
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:22,710
bind to the same addressing and dusters

1018
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:23,939
so that's a solution here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the error</font>

1019
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause</font>

1020
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,280
it's a similar behavior we do if an

1021
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:32,930
endpoint restarts with a new IP address

1022
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:36,090
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also don't allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this and here we</font>

1023
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,859
may put in this error cost telling this

1024
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:41,580
was the old encapsidation how this is

1025
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:44,700
the new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah that's why you get</font>

1026
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,560
aborted and there is a maybe cuz we also

1027
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,529
have a may for the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and it's</font>

1028
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:54,110
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operator to decide if he wants</font>

1029
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:56,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be open and say what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1030
00:58:54,110 --> 00:59:00,090
it's nice for debugging if you're an

1031
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:01,770
attacker you get hints what why it went

1032
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:04,920
wrong and might give you additional

1033
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:06,870
information so some operators might

1034
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:20,160
wanna switch this off that's why we

1035
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:22,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lights</font>

1036
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">under such as it did you did you change</font>

1037
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,580
these months yeah I pushed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extra</font>

1038
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">slide so again I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I yeah yeah okay</font>

1039
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that was walking like oh yeah okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1040
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:40,109
yeah this is correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> but doesn't fit</font>

1041
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:42,629
actually the thing so um it says what we

1042
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:45,780
had two versions of slacks yeah so we

1043
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:47,220
have a hybrid here yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

1044
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,290
is so we have implemented this in

1045
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:52,080
frequency we have some some experience

1046
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:55,440
the whole issue came up while we had

1047
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:59,460
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> running use the lens tags</font>

1048
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:01,830
and running into this issue so the

1049
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to progress this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1050
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:09,270
stuff there are three options harmony

1051
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:12,030
one is to file an errata on the existing

1052
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:14,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">RFC and say well here is a missing thing</font>

1053
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:18,720
and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you need to do it don't</font>

1054
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:21,149
think we can get this error course in by

1055
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:26,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">anuradha because of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inr agency stuff</font>

1056
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:28,200
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Plan B would be um well the reason</font>

1057
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:32,040
you can get it in as<font color="#CCCCCC"> neurotics is</font>

1058
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:34,259
actually a change what is an oversight

1059
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,058
in the original spec it's not her yeah

1060
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,239
yeah yeah

1061
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:42,299
water<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just yeah yeah china is not</font>

1062
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:43,949
because you need next<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i under many</font>

1063
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:45,869
operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

1064
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:48,390
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't care that</font>

1065
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:50,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">much about the error cost but um so</font>

1066
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:53,069
first thing will be an errata second

1067
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:57,469
would be progress this document<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font>

1068
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:59,759
an RFC status updating the existing one

1069
01:00:57,469 --> 01:01:02,189
however the original document<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

1070
01:00:59,759 --> 01:01:04,019
that large and having to RFC's to look

1071
01:01:02,189 --> 01:01:06,239
at for this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also not the optimal</font>

1072
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:08,999
things or the third possibility would be

1073
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:13,369
to let this document died and just do

1074
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:13,368
the base of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> european caps document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1075
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:21,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked to these guys before what is the</font>

1076
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:24,390
best thing i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one agreed that</font>

1077
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:28,140
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it looks like</font>

1078
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:30,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biss this document far they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

1079
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:32,910
UDP I kept saying is the best way to go

1080
01:01:30,329 --> 01:01:34,650
at people if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is have a</font>

1081
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:37,529
single document to read and these

1082
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:39,180
sentences can easily fit into the things

1083
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:42,900
they're so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that complicated</font>

1084
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:45,839
change who are the people who refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1085
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,579
the original document<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what RF</font>

1086
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:51,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">season specs rely on the original</font>

1088
01:01:51,239 --> 01:02:01,499
you do a best for the UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cap stock</font>

1089
01:01:54,779 --> 01:02:08,819
this is used by none Northern armies

1090
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:10,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">refer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it no I don't think so I mean</font>

1091
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:13,619
it doesn't say even if some documents

1092
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:18,239
referred to it it it will create<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1095
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:25,249
be produce a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of the document</font>

1096
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:27,359
as a best document and update it because

1097
01:02:25,249 --> 01:02:31,038
nobody wants to read two sets of

1098
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:33,869
boilerplate to implement one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1099
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:35,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">final for my question this is then the</font>

1100
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:38,789
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time the first version is an</font>

1101
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:40,259
individual submission and then I that

1102
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:42,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a question but how you change it i</font>

1103
01:02:40,259 --> 01:02:44,400
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first the first question is who</font>

1104
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,509
who who wants to do this is this a thing

1105
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,269
we should be doing in the working group

1106
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:51,589
should we be implementing this update I

1107
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:53,598
think so and I would be willing to do

1108
01:02:51,589 --> 01:02:56,299
that you'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and it</font>

1109
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">fixed a security problem and which</font>

1110
01:02:56,299 --> 01:03:01,369
probably is a good motivation for doing

1111
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:04,190
the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can submit an</font>

1112
01:03:01,369 --> 01:03:05,660
individual document we will then<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1113
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:09,680
people to have read that<font color="#E5E5E5"> document before</font>

1114
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:23,450
we can talk about adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1122
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:55,749
presented in Japan David I presented

this wonderful slide with<font color="#CCCCCC"> rüdiger game</font>

the underlying services provided in the

01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:26,210
at least interoperable between different

1132
01:04:23,289 --> 01:04:29,690
diffserv domains thus different operator

1133
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:32,420
networks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1134
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:34,519
draft is that not all diffserv fields

1135
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:36,529
will necessarily be supported in the

1136
01:04:34,519 --> 01:04:38,598
different domains and therefore it talks

1137
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:40,759
about what the practical issues are in

1138
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:43,190
mapping diffserv from one diffserv

1139
01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:45,499
demand to the next with the idea of

1140
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:48,009
reducing some end-to-end diffserv

1141
01:04:45,499 --> 01:04:48,009
support

1142
01:04:51,869 --> 01:04:56,670
this is an exact copy of the side

1143
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,499
presented in Japan if you want to ask

1144
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:02,759
comments on it i shall try and answer it

1145
01:04:58,499 --> 01:05:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">i shall not try and explain it the work</font>

1146
01:05:02,759 --> 01:05:09,119
on diffserv and intercom has been

1147
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:11,249
maturing this particular draft and has

1148
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,569
been stable since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1149
01:05:11,249 --> 01:05:18,359
relatively small changes I'm interested

1150
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:20,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">in people who might wish to review this</font>

1151
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,808
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft because it is</font>

1152
01:05:20,339 --> 01:05:26,839
coming up for working group last call

1153
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:31,319
soon so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I've got is</font>

1154
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:36,029
as anybody read the diffserv intercom

1155
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:38,609
draft recently yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay few people</font>

1156
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:40,980
would anybody be willing to read the

1157
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:47,690
latest version and check whether this

1158
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:51,329
appears to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> finished Fred well oh you</font>

1159
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:53,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks so we have two people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1160
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:56,609
will read the latest version and see if

1161
01:05:53,640 --> 01:06:00,180
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is complete and possibly ready for</font>

1162
01:05:56,609 --> 01:06:02,308
publication if you want to pass comments

1163
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:22,950
on it please do please<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the mailing</font>

1164
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:26,789
list is Gonzalez here you be next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1165
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:29,189
um thank Gary I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to to give</font>

1166
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:31,769
a heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on on the Aquabot that is</font>

1167
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:34,079
actually quite relevant to to the armed

1168
01:06:31,769 --> 01:06:37,979
transport area as a matter of fact is a

1169
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,599
transport book so i am gonna basically

1170
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:41,789
no summarize a bit what we're going to

1171
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,069
discuss their the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to run the</font>

1172
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,779
buff here as you can imagine so it's

1173
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:47,670
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know so that you you guys</font>

1174
01:06:45,779 --> 01:06:51,359
know if you want to go on on thursday to

1175
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:54,480
to check it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I code basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1176
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">above sponsor bye bye Spencer as the</font>

1177
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,130
transport ID and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of this is</font>

1178
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:01,319
like as you know I mean we've been seen

1179
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:03,630
a lot of an encryption on the internet

1180
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:04,970
and operators are seen more and more

1181
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,280
encrypted traffic on the

1182
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:09,049
networks on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> several reasons for</font>

1183
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,480
that one of them is the idea basically

1184
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">not moving and encouraging people to</font>

1185
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,770
increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic and coming up with</font>

1186
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,629
protocols that use encryption by default

1187
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:20,270
all of that but they sell actually know

1188
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:22,609
many other<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons a out there which</font>

1189
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:24,920
basically the end result is like people

1190
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:27,759
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the traffic um in</font>

1191
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular mobile operators they tend to</font>

1192
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:34,160
do different things to manage traffic on

1193
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,960
their radio networks and some of those

1194
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:38,480
techniques they rely on actually being

1195
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,070
able to see the traffic so when a lot of

1196
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,080
traffic is encrypted they cannot

1197
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:46,060
actually do all those things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1198
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:48,890
do for operation and management so um

1199
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:50,930
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GSMA is the organization of</font>

1200
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:53,089
you know the mobile operators many many

1201
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,859
of them are are there so they started to

1202
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:58,040
analyze you know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do and</font>

1203
01:07:54,859 --> 01:08:00,049
and they actually the IAB<font color="#CCCCCC"> reyna works up</font>

1204
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:03,740
with them ah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> workshop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was called</font>

1205
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:05,720
Manu and the IAB was there many ITF

1206
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:08,509
people was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyway it was kind</font>

1207
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,790
of like you know reduce um effort so it

1208
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF white thing like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ba</font>

1209
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:15,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">fees they're basically it was</font>

1210
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:18,380
interesting for the operators to explain

1211
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:19,759
what they do because many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times it's</font>

1212
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,549
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different what you can see on a</font>

1213
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:25,009
3gpp architecture for example to what is

1214
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:27,290
actually deployed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even to what is</font>

1215
01:08:25,009 --> 01:08:28,969
actually in use so that was interesting

1216
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:32,000
for for people to understand a bit

1217
01:08:28,969 --> 01:08:33,880
better what is the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know</font>

1218
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,229
the idea is basically to come here and

1219
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,009
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss with the ideas as a</font>

1220
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:41,750
whole um what is the actual problem

1221
01:08:39,009 --> 01:08:44,450
understand you know what are the pain

1222
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:46,370
points that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are suffering um things</font>

1223
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:49,339
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and they cannot and</font>

1224
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:51,680
you know to find basically ways that you

1225
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:53,450
know they they allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use both</font>

1226
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,069
encryption and at the same time they can

1227
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:58,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">do what what they need to do with their</font>

1228
01:08:55,069 --> 01:09:00,290
with their networks as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see if</font>

1229
01:08:58,339 --> 01:09:02,930
you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the both page this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a non</font>

1230
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:06,049
working group forming performing both so

1231
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:07,850
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the point actually is not to</font>

1232
01:09:06,049 --> 01:09:09,410
create an awkward<font color="#CCCCCC"> boat that is going to</font>

1233
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:11,210
be working on that the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1234
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:14,028
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the requirements understand</font>

1235
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:16,609
the scenarios and once we do that there

1236
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:18,339
may be solutions that the IPF could

1237
01:09:16,609 --> 01:09:20,259
develop if that happens

1238
01:09:18,339 --> 01:09:22,839
they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be chartered independently on</font>

1239
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:24,698
on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> buff um one of the reasons i'm</font>

1240
01:09:22,839 --> 01:09:26,080
presently here is that some people

1241
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:28,598
thought for example that<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach surf</font>

1242
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:30,189
could be you know a solution you know

1243
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:33,549
one piece of the solution or in the

1244
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:36,068
solution space included be sure so if we

1245
01:09:33,549 --> 01:09:37,599
agreed at some point that diffserv was

1246
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:39,040
actually a useful thing to do and we

1247
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:41,080
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would obviously</font>

1248
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:43,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to the right working group and do</font>

1249
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:46,269
it there so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it's a bit of you</font>

1250
01:09:43,509 --> 01:09:47,710
know discussion both just to to to

1251
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:51,099
understand basically problem space

1252
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:53,799
instead of scope I mean a very night I

1253
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:55,480
well scope effort and then we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1254
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:57,580
it from there actually depending on the

1255
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,699
discussions the the understanding we get

1256
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:04,000
we will you know decide how to how to

1257
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:06,159
follow it could be you know chartering

1258
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,840
work in different groups it could be

1259
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:10,089
actually know maybe using existing

1260
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,790
mechanisms and that remains<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

1261
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:16,270
seen so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

1262
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:23,170
enough for a heads up if someone has any

1263
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:24,820
questions or clarifications to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to</font>

1264
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:30,280
the mic if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font>

1265
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:32,380
anything I what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

1266
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:35,139
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there a if their own agenda and</font>

1267
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,489
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of drops yes we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Asians yeah</font>

1268
01:10:35,139 --> 01:10:38,560
that's a good point<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we are a</font>

1269
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:40,718
playa plotting everything as we get it

1270
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:44,290
so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the draft</font>

1271
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:46,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis life actually the agenda I I</font>

1272
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:49,090
would suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before doing</font>

1273
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:51,849
any of that you go on face the<font color="#CCCCCC"> man new</font>

1274
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:53,080
report from the IAB and really just to

1275
01:10:51,849 --> 01:10:55,179
understand you know what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1276
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,800
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap work so maybe you are not a</font>

1277
01:10:55,179 --> 01:10:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mueller with that and she basically just</font>

1278
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,310
44 background on on what are the

1279
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:02,650
discussion some of the discussions then

1280
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:04,810
they happen there as a matter of fact I

1281
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:07,239
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were surprising findings for</font>

1282
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:08,500
example I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to name one I mean</font>

1283
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:10,209
people thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know on the</font>

1284
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,909
radio networks they were using like like

1285
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:15,040
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different traffic classes and</font>

1286
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:17,980
that wasn't actually true for real

1287
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:19,630
deployment so so you may actually you

1288
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:21,669
know find a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprises</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there if you</font>

1289
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,650
are not too familiar with how radio

1290
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:25,900
networks and cellular technologies work

1291
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:28,119
actually so so my suggestion go there

1292
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,888
read the report and then have a look at

1293
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:31,610
the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts the slides and if</font>

1294
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:33,889
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested please come on</font>
