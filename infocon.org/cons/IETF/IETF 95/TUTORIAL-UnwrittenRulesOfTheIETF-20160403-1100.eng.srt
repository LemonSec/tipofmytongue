<font color="#E5E5E5">ietf mentoring team and today we're</font>

9
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to talk about a an interesting</font>

10
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,610
topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> well quiet the unwritten rules and</font>

11
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:34,619
values you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a</font>

12
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:38,009
little bit about it feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to go</font>

14
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:49,100
would like and discuss what we're

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:54,440
talking which is a collaborative effort

16
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:58,139
it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss what we offer Oh</font>

17
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:01,259
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is this presentation is</font>

18
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:09,320
because it's a part of a mentoring

19
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:12,209
program I gave how bad I stuff though

20
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,600
they have interesting interesting

21
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:19,049
questions and viewpoints and sometimes I

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:22,010
have one guy come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to me and say you</font>

23
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:25,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I don't think my draft is</font>

24
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:30,090
proceeding because I'm not part of an

25
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:33,660
inner group there's a drinking party

26
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:36,450
that happens on one of the nights of the

27
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,810
idea it's kind of it a tradition as you

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,820
might expect in a group like this and he

29
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,600
thought well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never got an invitation</font>

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,840
to that party<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so maybe I'm not in</font>

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,799
the inner circle and that's why my draft

32
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,739
doesn't proceed um well you know I

33
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,859
actually fell asleep and forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

34
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,049
the drinking party and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

35
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:03,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has anything to do with why your</font>

36
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,600
draft procedure or not so the reason

37
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,769
that's the reason that I started doing

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,409
this presentation is really start

39
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:16,700
conversation with some of the old-timers

40
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:19,700
and also to to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the new</font>

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:32,859
about really what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

42
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:32,859
anyway and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now some of it is thank you</font>

43
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:43,250
thanks and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

44
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,500
call aspirational what aspirational

45
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:53,780
means is that we want things to be fair

46
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:56,000
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and we want to all speak</font>

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:59,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">the truth at all times those are our</font>

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,920
values and sometimes we fall short so

49
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:07,280
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:10,399
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of other people think we</font>

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,310
should be at the IDF and what I ETF is

52
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,500
for and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you especially as new</font>

53
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:23,030
people become a to learn to understand

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,320
this very unique environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and</font>

55
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,190
i'm also going to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some examples</font>

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,110
of things that haven't worked which

57
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,200
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is good to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's good to</font>

58
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:41,030
know what didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it again please</font>

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:42,889
feel if you want to so let's first talk

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,750
about what the heck we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing here</font>

61
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,870
anyway and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take something</font>

62
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:53,330
from fred baker who's one of the former

63
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:56,150
chairs of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF um what he said is we</font>

64
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,340
are here to solve problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

65
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet what a lot of people might</font>

66
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:07,159
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is well what the IETF does is</font>

67
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:13,219
produce RFC's and so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to</font>

68
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:16,550
produce rfcs well yes yes in the end at

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:20,830
some point one would like to have

70
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:24,770
standards but it's all much more

71
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:29,000
complicated than that what can happen is

72
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:31,780
that um somebody sees a pro

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,600
and they even maybe start hallway

74
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:38,900
conversations about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem maybe then</font>

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,480
it goes to a barb off and then a working

76
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,890
group has started and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end things</font>

77
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:49,310
come out it's much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuanced than we</font>

78
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,969
produce RFC's in fact I've had some

79
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:58,030
people gauge the set I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gauge</font>

80
00:05:52,970 --> 00:06:01,990
the value of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> efforts by how many rfcs</font>

81
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:05,239
my company or my country can create and

82
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,450
and to me I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that's quite</font>

83
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">misguided because it may be much better</font>

84
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:18,680
to have more line in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC which is a</font>

85
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,229
seminal idea then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten rfcs which are</font>

86
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,320
never adopted by anyone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are</font>

87
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,960
not well well particularly well thought

88
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,580
out if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense to you so so as</font>

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,239
I said we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go to a very</font>

90
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:39,099
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of things then what</font>

91
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:44,560
sometimes maybe people like so the IETF

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:49,280
has a shared vision the shared vision is

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:55,460
to make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the best that it</font>

94
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:58,580
can be going forth oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk</font>

95
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:03,650
about evolution I when you have in

96
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:06,890
nature nature and evolution creates new

97
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:10,400
functions and so you adapt to the

98
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:13,610
environment and slowly you become a

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,210
better organism how can anybody do that

100
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,200
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet well we have to do that</font>

101
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to help the internet adapt to</font>

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,919
its environment how do you do that you

103
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:32,000
do that with constant innovation that's

104
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,568
why the whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovation and</font>

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,479
collaboration is such a very

106
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:47,460
important part of being at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF uh</font>

107
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:53,068
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally think that</font>

108
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:56,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet has provided a forum for</font>

109
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:59,819
much of the world to come together and

110
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,609
be a participant it's a disruptive idea

111
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,639
in the world and I think probably all

112
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:08,550
agree on the value of free and open

113
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,669
communication and if that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

114
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,669
supporting that's a very very important

115
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,099
thing to do and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we all</font>

116
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:20,039
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> collaborate if you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

117
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:22,199
things like electrical systems every

118
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,810
time you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some different country</font>

119
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,120
there's a different electrical system

120
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,069
that has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> plugged into you have to</font>

121
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,560
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what adapter with someone if</font>

122
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:35,130
the internet worked like that was it

123
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,159
good it couldn't work like that and so

124
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,620
we have to work together and so that's

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:49,800
why I say it's a very very important

126
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:52,589
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks it would be an important</font>

127
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,329
thing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody heard it no it's a very</font>

128
00:08:52,589 --> 00:09:04,890
important task that that we're doing

129
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:08,699
here and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> dad that's that's the</font>

130
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:13,110
shared vision that I think we all we all

131
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,630
have and so the rooms and<font color="#E5E5E5"> values that</font>

132
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:19,110
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is if something</font>

133
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:22,500
that you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is seen as threatening</font>

134
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this core vision you're going to get</font>

135
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,440
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from people you're going to get</font>

136
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,230
people thinking that you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

137
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,899
wrong thing and it's all most people

138
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,209
don't even know why they're reacting to

139
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,130
you that way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've definitely seen it</font>

140
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:41,449
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and talk to</font>

141
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:46,050
you about I'm a number of very concrete

142
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:47,990
examples in which i saw this<font color="#E5E5E5"> apple kind</font>

143
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a you know do this don't do</font>

144
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:53,620
as I said I want to give you the the

145
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:57,440
overall picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on the other hand</font>

146
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,709
if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that supports</font>

147
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,160
the core vision of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF which is</font>

148
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:07,790
again collaboration and innovation in

149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,829
support of the internet then even if

150
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,779
what you're doing is quite radical

151
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,149
within the sense that it's never been

152
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,850
done before you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of support</font>

153
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,190
and I can speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that personally with</font>

154
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,160
the mentoring program we've tried all

155
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:25,940
kinds of very new things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no other</font>

156
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,240
organization ever does including for

157
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,120
example like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and and I have gotten</font>

158
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">a huge amount of support from lots of</font>

159
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,010
people to go through and talk about

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kinds of things and do these</font>

161
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:48,589
activities because it supports our core

162
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:53,660
vision ok so the IETF is not just an RFC

163
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:57,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">male of course in the end you want to</font>

164
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:01,189
have something that is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

165
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,950
is a standard in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end whether that</font>

166
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:07,550
happens in two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months three months five</font>

167
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:11,170
years that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different story you may</font>

168
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,209
also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in commenting on</font>

169
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:17,390
somebody else's work to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that better</font>

170
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:20,119
that is wonderful that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it</font>

171
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:21,980
may be somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's idea that you're</font>

172
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,770
helping to improve that's called

173
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:28,640
teamwork and collaboration it's very

174
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:32,240
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> valuable so what people feel is</font>

175
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write an RFC and that</font>

176
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,370
gives me prestige and importance<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

177
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,920
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these new things after</font>

178
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,890
my name well the real prestige is

179
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,160
actually solving the problem you know to

180
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,470
solve the problem of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,040
internet

182
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:54,370
the transport layers that's the actual

183
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:59,920
problem that's the prestige and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say</font>

184
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:03,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shared vision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you may</font>

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:10,540
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF has faults and I can</font>

186
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:13,569
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to you if 500 false that the</font>

187
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:17,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF has but one of the things that it</font>

188
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,420
also has it tries to fix them you can it

189
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,580
you have open communication where people

190
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,550
try to fix the fault and if you think

191
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,470
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something wrong speak up let's</font>

192
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,550
see if we can fix it I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

193
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:33,910
very important but do not forget that a

194
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:37,300
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small number of people have created</font>

195
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and continue to create the innovation</font>

196
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,380
that supports the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I was joking</font>

197
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:49,420
around with somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last IETF at</font>

198
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,040
them at the Welcome Party and and you

199
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,060
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said you know what if somebody</font>

200
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,120
put a bomb right here and blew up the

201
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,760
the welcome party for the IETF in six

202
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,460
months a great deal if the innovation on

203
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,040
the internet would stop that's true

204
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,650
that's true a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,599
people have supported what we know as

206
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,260
this very important thing called the

207
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,470
internet and how it's because and one of

208
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:24,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why it works that way is</font>

209
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:27,490
because of unspoken rules of the IETF

210
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,150
one of the very first things somebody

211
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:35,320
told me when I came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF and I</font>

212
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:38,439
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make my way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he said</font>

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,960
you know the IETF is a community you

214
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,960
give back to the community and they will

215
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,200
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to you don't just think about</font>

216
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,240
what you want and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I took that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

217
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,810
very much to heart and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

218
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,790
true um and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things I'm going</font>

219
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about are things that we don't</font>

220
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,000
talk about as engineers I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

221
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,939
talk about things like trust

222
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,340
um as eyes out I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little</font>

223
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,820
story there's a story about a Russian

224
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:12,210
physicist he lived in a time when people

225
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:14,700
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not talk openly in Russia about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

226
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,760
was going on in the political system and

227
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:23,610
so people were afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so one</font>

228
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:26,370
day in his group he<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked openly in his</font>

229
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,030
apartment with with his friends about

230
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:33,030
exactly what he felt and the next day he

231
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:36,360
found the solution to a physics problem

232
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:40,530
that he had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working about on and so</font>

233
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,830
it it seems very<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd it what does trust</font>

234
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:47,699
have to do with physics and what does

235
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:53,040
trust and safety have to do with

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:55,440
computer systems well it does if I don't

237
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,390
know how I don't think any of us know

238
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,790
how but that feeling of trust and

239
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,069
community makes it possible to do

240
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:09,150
innovation in a way that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

241
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:11,280
any of us knew how<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and and I would</font>

242
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,180
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear some of the old-timers talk</font>

243
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,270
to this too um I know in my own startup

244
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,550
we have a lot of trust with each other

245
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,100
we're very vulnerable about what we know

246
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:29,819
what we don't know and it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

247
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:32,880
do a lot of innovation so let's talk

248
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:39,810
concretely about some of the values of

249
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:45,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF well what are these values do</font>

250
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:49,439
your own work um the IETF very much mmm

251
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:53,130
how do i say believes in having your own

252
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:58,080
thoughts it they may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> half-formed they</font>

253
00:15:53,130 --> 00:16:00,660
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be um completely the the final</font>

254
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing but do your own work and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in a</font>

255
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,610
show I talk to you about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

256
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:11,760
work and and even if it's kooky or weird

257
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,640
do it try it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and learn from</font>

258
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,689
others

259
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">take feedback then the next thing do</font>

260
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,690
really good work that's very very

261
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,430
important it sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what why would</font>

262
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,770
somebody even have to say that to me

263
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,349
well i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you examples of</font>

264
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,650
where people did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do their own work</font>

265
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:35,530
nor did they do really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good work if</font>

266
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:37,780
people are not um how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said people</font>

267
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:39,640
know people know when you know what

268
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,310
you're talking about when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a</font>

269
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:45,100
bunch of time thinking about the packet

270
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,920
flow in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular area where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

271
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,410
exactly what these<font color="#E5E5E5"> dis flow yes and what</font>

272
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,040
the problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can tell they can</font>

273
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,689
tell do really good work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just i'm</font>

274
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,569
going to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a methodology for how</font>

275
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,410
you might do really good work and and

276
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:06,190
you will get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of respect um have it</font>

277
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,020
work in reality that means it doesn't it

278
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:11,050
shouldn't just be a theoretical

279
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,780
construct this is something people are

280
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,930
going to put on their real networks so

281
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,589
if you can have running code that's very

282
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:23,199
very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and important or if you can</font>

283
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,730
have a real example even prototype code

284
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,650
to start with very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important um</font>

285
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:34,180
haven't worked for everybody that's one

286
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:36,880
of the big important things about being

316
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:06,360
if you if you have results that are like

317
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:09,000
eighty percent just say it's eighty

318
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,389
percent don't think oh it's a little bit

319
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,030
less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred percent wait I think</font>

320
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean just sit and then say what didn't</font>

321
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:21,990
work what did work um we're equal I'll

322
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,750
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some more this is a non</font>

323
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,730
hierarchical organization having<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

324
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,130
that I mean there are of course you know

325
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,980
working group chairs area directors and

326
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:35,130
so on but by and large everybody's

327
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,500
opinion should be equal to everybody

328
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,720
else's of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people know more</font>

329
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,060
and so their opinion is to be more

330
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,210
highly regarded but just because you

331
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">think somebody is older than you or for</font>

332
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,750
women if somebody is a man and or vice

333
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,310
versa<font color="#CCCCCC"> if their opinion is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not better</font>

334
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,980
necessarily but for those things you

335
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:59,460
know if they know more oh yes then then

336
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,550
their opinion is better so and the other

337
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,920
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> care people can tell when you</font>

338
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:08,550
don't care about what you do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

339
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:11,850
tell and this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard area</font>

340
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:13,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">it takes a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort and if you</font>

341
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,340
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually love what you're doing</font>

342
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:20,100
it's gonna be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to stay in</font>

343
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the long term okay this is</font>

344
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what I tell my teenage daughter</font>

345
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:27,120

348

349
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:38,879
here they love what they do and they can

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,010
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you don't and then the last</font>

351
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,390

356
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,020

357
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,770
seem so silly don't be afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

358
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:08,940
silly ideas don't be afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have bad</font>

359
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:11,879
ideas because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's only</font>

360
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,700
after having a lot of bad ideas and

361
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,790
having fixed them that you get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

362
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,950
some good ideas I'm a product developer

363
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,889
I cannot tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how many unsuccessful</font>

364
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:28,920
products I've had you just I'll stop

365
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:31,800
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't an interesting do</font>

366
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:36,240
not do this kind of a thing there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

367
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:39,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and they they took their work from</font>

368
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,150
somebody who had IPR on it it was and

369
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:45,270
it's okay IPR means they had a somebody

370
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:49,890
else had a patent on a particular idea

371
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:53,250
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to do that but you have</font>

372
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:56,490
to give credit you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this person has a</font>

373
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:59,550
patent on this and ideally you ask them

374
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:02,220
to co-author and so then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

375
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,200
that they co-author with you they did

376
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,890
this people didn't do that they present

377
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:10,050
somebody else's idea as their own and it

378
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,430
took a while for people to find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

379
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the thing of do your own work</font>

380
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:18,030
people will find out this is a very

381
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,469
large community a lot of very smart

382
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:23,370
people you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you won't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away with</font>

383
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you won't and what happens then is</font>

384
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:30,149
when these people present nobody says

385
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,310
anything I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they get</font>

386
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,900
agenda time but everybody is very quiet

387
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,928
and this is very not quiet group if

388
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font>

389
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:43,259
meeting and you're presenting something

390
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,820
and everybody is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very quiet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

391
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:48,309
either you're saying something<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font>

392
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:53,369
really gets it and and really agrees

393
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:56,619
with you which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope or they're like</font>

394
00:22:53,369 --> 00:23:01,629
I'm not I'm not wasting my time doing

395
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:04,149
this it's very that's a very it's very

396
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice a it you don't want to be in the</font>

397
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:08,379
position where nobody's commenting on

398
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:11,340
your work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of times when people</font>

399
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:16,748
don't comment on your work is because

400
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:20,110
you've broken some kind of rule do

401
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:23,019
really good work and again as I say why

402
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:27,639
would I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not talking two</font>

403
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:31,960
teenagers there is a group a person

404
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:34,059
annum I in three four or five different

405
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:38,200
meetings of the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group they</font>

406
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:41,470
present very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same draft it</font>

407
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:45,730
was obvious that very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought and</font>

408
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:48,070
work had been put into that draft and um

409
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:51,159
and they keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over and over</font>

410
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,860
again and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things is like when</font>

411
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,929
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know to be</font>

412
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:58,719
experts and some people you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to be</font>

413
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there called icons of the IETF you</font>

414
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,460
people i know some of these people they

415
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,999
have sometimes have long<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray beards and</font>

416
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,690
if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people stands up and</font>

417
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:14,320
says to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a</font>

418
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,419
fundamental flaw in your work if

419
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,269
somebody says that to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sink into the</font>

420
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:21,759
ground engine in horrified shame that

421
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,799
somebody of that stature would say

422
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,549
something like that to me in a working

423
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:29,799
group so do you try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

424
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:31,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not happen and if they're kind</font>

425
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:35,049
enough to say something like that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

426
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,360

quietly and not say a word that is if

438
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,470
you get in a situation where people are

442
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:19,770
but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be F if you've had lots</font>

443
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:22,139
of struggle for 23 years where everybody

450
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:51,659
it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things um its</font>

451
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:56,550
work and commitment and some people have

452
00:25:51,660 --> 00:26:00,530
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> here have what 30 40 years of</font>

work on real networks I mean I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

454
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:06,240
fell in love with<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks over 30 years</font>

456
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:14,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have a real hands-on experience</font>

457
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,470
working with this kind of stuff so my

458
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:20,190
personal opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to get very much</font>

459
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,520
hands-on experience look at packets

460
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,340
studying look at the protocols read the

461
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,179
drafts and see if you can completely

462
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,730
understand what's going on it try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

463
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,990
in group whenever we're writing a new

464
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:39,120
draft we have a group and we meet weekly

465
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:41,940
and to see exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going on and</font>

466
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,120
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great if we do this for</font>

467
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,740
people just to review drafts 2 i'm

468
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,139
considering that starting part of that

469
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,050
as a part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the mentoring program you</font>

470
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,179
know some groups to study and we can do

471
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:55,620
it in between drafts you know for

472
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,230
different working groups and let's just

473
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through because one of the things</font>

474
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,879
that happens is that often times people

475
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,458
think

476
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:09,279
I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> very smart I'm smartest person in</font>

477
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:13,649
my company oh maybe I'm even genius okay

478
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:18,159
fine but I can tell you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> real life</font>

479
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:20,918
results that a team a collaboration of

480
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:24,879
people with even average intelligence

481
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:26,829
can often beat a solitary genius because

482
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:28,869
they have different points of view they

483
00:27:26,829 --> 00:27:32,109
can correct each other they can support

484
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:37,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other it's a very very important</font>

485
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:40,359
thing to have collaboration um next get

486
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:43,569
feedback get feedback from other people

487
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:47,468
in every<font color="#E5E5E5"> group you'll find two three</font>

488
00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:50,789
four five<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner circle the expert people</font>

489
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:54,039
go to them and say look tell me honestly

490
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:56,169
what do you think of this when when we

491
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,079
were first starting out on our draft I

492
00:27:56,169 --> 00:28:02,559
would make an appointment you know half

493
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:04,690
an hour with each person<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the IDF and</font>

494
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,609
just say don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be afraid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of hurting my</font>

495
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,819
feelings tell me exactly what's wrong

496
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:12,279
and actually the people you really want

497
00:28:09,819 --> 00:28:14,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody stands up and</font>

the process see about so does your idea

513
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:03,849
really fit into the working group one of

514
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:05,948
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I've seen is that you may</font>

515
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:08,168
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good idea what you're in</font>

516
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:10,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">the wrong working group or the working</font>

517
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:14,350
group is going down a particular

518
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:17,110
direction and their focus is not

519
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,469
really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

520
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:23,229
so talk it over with them and they

521
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,720
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be swayed to you know I i</font>

522
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,240

523
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to sway the working</font>

524
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,350
group a little bit they say okay okay

525
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,440
yeah yeah just your idea does fit in it

526
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:38,379
fits in this way so that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

527
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:43,980
again get a team each<font color="#E5E5E5"> person can work on</font>

529
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,840

530
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:52,960
people's presentation skills could

531
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,049
really use some help you know make sure

532
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people really understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know</font>

536
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:11,199

people will do and in fact I know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

542
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,880
if you approach the mentoring team I'm

543
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:30,789
sure I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get mentors who will be happy</font>

544
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,309
to help you do that or help you help you

545
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,830
present in front of an audience the bet

546
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:39,190
the more people really understand what

547
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:42,039
you're doing the better reaction oh that

548
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,620
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have do it more than once maybe</font>

549
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:46,450
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it first in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your local language you</font>

550
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,189
know that way it's easy to understand

551
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,890
that will you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ideas done and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the time I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what to say you</font>

555
00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:02,289
know yesterday I was at a get together

some of the things in spanish and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

558
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,280
caught maybe one word out of 10 so you

559
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,220
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry</font>

560
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's but that's the rules you</font>

561
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:18,429
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we're living right now</font>

562
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:21,100
and then ask ask the experienced people

563
00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,740
to review this is what i mean by doing

564
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:26,090
your homework you know go in there and

565
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,490
if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

566
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:32,178
person has done their homework better

567
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,520
than anybody else then then you're

568
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,200
liable to get a real good hearing again

569

575
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:59,629
then you know you manage to get

576
00:31:53,299 --> 00:32:03,830
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> done again honesty and trust</font>

577
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:09,169
are very important try not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seen as</font>

578
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:12,100
having a private agenda and now ok this

579
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:15,620
is quote unquote it's an aspirational I

580
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally know that there are people who</font>

581
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and they want to do</font>

582
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,460
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their company wants yeah</font>

583
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:29,570
okay I get it I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

584
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:33,200
but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes what the company wants</font>

585
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:36,110
is for the best of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so great</font>

586
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful sometimes not so much though</font>

587
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:44,779
not so much and but I will say that if

588
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,970
you're seen as the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of person we</font>

589
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:49,520
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them chills you know somebody who</font>

590
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:52,460
just talks about what the company want

591
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:55,220
rather than your own personal technical

592
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,230
considered opinion people will people

593
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,480
who'll know that people will know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

594
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:03,740
and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take your word for</font>

595
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:05,779
exactly that especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you change</font>

596
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,370
when you go to a different company and

597
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,529
all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden now you're saying</font>

598
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:13,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different is like what</font>

599
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay anyway so it's very in this group</font>

600
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:20,510
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important that your scene</font>

601
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:23,450
is what you see is what you get that

602
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,850
means when you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is what you</font>

603
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:29,870
truly believe they may not agree with

604
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:32,330
you it's totally fine not to agree but

605
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,090
it's not like this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

606
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">group is like some is like if you were</font>

607
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,879
in a group where you're doing a lot of

608
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,010
diplomacy you can count

609
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,960
on that what you're saying is not at all

610
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,330
what you believe it's maybe what your

611
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,200
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> believes or what you have to say</font>

612
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:51,720
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of group if you</font>

613
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,200
mean and people get into problems that

614
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:59,520
way and life for example this this whole

615
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,490
presentation it's what I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

616
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:05,730
may agree people may disagree but it's

617
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:09,830
what I believe to be true and and and

618
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:12,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then people have respect for that</font>

619
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,659
this leads into something else there's a

620
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:19,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people who feel that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> etfs are</font>

621
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:23,190
very rude sometimes that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be true and</font>

622
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:27,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">I certainly been on the on the receiving</font>

623
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:32,159
side as well as unfortunately the giving

624
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:35,909
side of being extremely blunt about what

625
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,490
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about somebody's idea and have</font>

626
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:40,800
had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way to wear and sometimes</font>

627
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:42,888
I know when somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> meals it when</font>

628
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,919
you've been saying something and

629
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately they see the exact flaw in</font>

630
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,210
everything that you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying and</font>

631
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,879
you've been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this for you know</font>

632
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:57,990
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months and they they nail you in one</font>

633
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:01,140
sentence you're like whoa and sometimes

634
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:05,459
your immediate reaction is to be oh no

635
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not true but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be yeah</font>

636
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:15,300
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful be careful and it listen</font>

637
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,870
listen and the other way to what again

638
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:23,970
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why we're here we're</font>

639
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:27,150
here to do extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> good engineering to</font>

640
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:30,299
support the core vision which is

641
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:33,120
innovation on the internet so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

642
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,390
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if somebody nails you finds</font>

643
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,910
the flop will then fix it fix it make it

644
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,859
better it trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that person to</font>

645
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:46,170
work with you maybe and saying will you

646
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:49,160
be co-author um it but the honesty is

647
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,160
very important

648
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:58,000
hmm having said that as in this session

649
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:01,390
remember you're being<font color="#CCCCCC"> recorded and</font>

650
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,570
people will people all over the world

651
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:09,170
can can hear what you're saying so

652
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:12,560
that's be<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes in a</font>

653
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:14,630
heated exchange and again I've certainly

654
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,930
been guilty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you say things that</font>

655
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,830
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little more harshly than than</font>

656
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:25,009
you might want to do but remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

657
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:27,170
going to be especially things like email

658
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:30,380
exchanges it's going to be there so so

659
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:32,540
try to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> careful try to be polite you</font>

660
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:34,490

don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share your toys if you</font>

664
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:44,180

672
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,470
strange at first and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas are very</font>

673
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,230
strange I think we've kind of chatted

674

678
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:35,180
of person who can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a third value</font>

679
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,060
of a binary field they may go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the</font>

680
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,160
future just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something very very</font>

686
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:56,390
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a little bit of a thick</font>

687
00:37:53,390 --> 00:38:01,700
skin if you truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe in it work on</font>

688
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:03,279
the idea and develop it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> um in India</font>

689
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,549
we had there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mathematician</font>

690
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,160
Srinivasa Ramanujan and and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at it</font>

691
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">was what's called an autodidact he</font>

692
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,569
taught himself he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a very small</font>

693
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:22,759
town in southern<font color="#E5E5E5"> India he redeveloped</font>

694
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:27,740
many many of the seminal of theorems and

695
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,960
proofs for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher mathematics and he</font>

696
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:33,109
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> village nobody taught</font>

697
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:38,300
him innovation comes from very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd</font>

698
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:41,380
places so so so respect others and let

699
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,380
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from yourself</font>

700
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,870
so now one of the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I</font>

701
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,170
hear people talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called the</font>

702
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:08,029
old boys club this is again like with

703
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,730
the young man who said well I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

704
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:13,520
invited to this drinking party and I'm

705
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:15,710
not an old boy and that's why my draft

706
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,050
doesn't go you know it's all these

707
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,990
people who know each other and they've

708
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:23,540
known each other for a long time well

709
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:26,990
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I mean I'm going to speak</font>

710
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:30,790
as somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a boy nor that old</font>

711
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:33,740
and and I managed to get drafts past

712
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,710
when they're when they're good it's not

713
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,990
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about again it's it really is about</font>

714
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,480
the kind of work you do it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

715
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:47,390
whether you go out to drinking parties

716
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:50,630
whether you're a man or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

717
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:53,420
know it's not about that what what

718
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I think happens is that this is</font>

719
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very very odd group of people and it's</font>

720
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:03,620
a group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> where people actually</font>

721
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:07,540
love thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in writing protocols</font>

722
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:10,609
and thinking about that get very very

723
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:14,060
excited and passionate and care very

724
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:18,760
much about certain algorithms and and

725
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:22,430
that kind of person probably doesn't

726
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,830
find that many other people in what I'll

727
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,440
call the real world who are like them

728
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:29,420
and to be honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you I'm gonna say</font>

729
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,030
you know I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak as somebody</font>

730
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,670
who feels that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fit</font>

731
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,340
into this environment I mean I basically

732
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,250
and not going to be you know if I go to

733
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,040
the PTA meeting no the gals are going to

734
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,410
be wanting to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know TLS 1</font>

735
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,690
dot 3 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 I mean they're just like</font>

736
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:50,839
not going to be wanting to do that and

737
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:53,570
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this environment and</font>

738
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,530
other people care very very passionately

739
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:59,480
about a particular protocol flow sure

740
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:02,300
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

741
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">people and especially if you find a</font>

742
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,760
working group where they totally care

743
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,560
about the problem you're going to solve

744
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,280
of course you're going to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

745
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,980
you've found you

746
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,280
people and then yeah it feels like an

747
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,960
old boys club but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what if if</font>

748
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,840
you do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

749
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:27,710
said it won't take long before you're

750
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:32,060
part of the old boys club too and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

751
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">other thing ISM is about respect for</font>

752
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:40,820
others and and how people and having

753
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:44,950
their approval to UM one of the things

754
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is you know it</font>

755
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:51,379
this takes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work and a lot of</font>

756
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,200
times when you do really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good work and</font>

757
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,980
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the icons are one of the experts</font>

758
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,549
or people that you respect they tell you

759
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:04,850
very good that was that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

760
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:08,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like people saying very good work</font>

761
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:11,660
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not come get that often at the IETF</font>

762
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,070
they'll just not say anything and and

763
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,700
then that's good but when somebody

764
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,710
actually says very good job especially

765
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:23,350
if it's one of the icons you're like

766
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,350
well thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

767
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:37,009
so as I say if if you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font>

768
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:42,320
an old boys club it's just relief<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

769
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:47,930
at having found your people and that's

770
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,270
why um if you find people being somewhat

771
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:54,710
brutally honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and you the</font>

772
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:57,550
other way<font color="#E5E5E5"> um mmm it happens and I as I</font>

773
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,550
say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

774
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:26,280
we hit we need a hardware guy the powers

775
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">their guess</font>

776
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,210
sorry

777
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:39,019
you're a deeper just just let me know we

778
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,019
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in touch with you</font>

779
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:45,130
you

780
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:22,830
let's let's continue um we talked a

781
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:26,250
little bit about transparency about not

782
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:29,340
leaving things out very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

783
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:32,790
if peep if people see that you're hiding

784
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">things they're not going to trust you</font>

785
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,810
they're not going to trust you don't say

786
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:43,320
my results are one hundred percent if

787
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:46,259
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so it talked a little bit</font>

788
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,240
about this integrity flip-flopping your

789
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:51,570
opinion should be your opinion I may not

790
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:56,368
agree with you and it's totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

791
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:59,250
I should know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's European yeah</font>

792
00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:02,730
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something again is like can you</font>

793
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:04,890
disagree with people um of course of

794
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:08,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">course but I know some people some</font>

795
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:10,020
companies even have a policy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

796
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,470
you should not disagree with the senior

797
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:15,060
people of your company in public<font color="#E5E5E5"> boy to</font>

798
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:18,270
me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what kind of integrity is</font>

799
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:21,150
that um my daughter disagrees with me

800
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:24,540
loudly and all the time and sometimes

801
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:29,400
she's right you know it's is OK is OK to

802
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:31,050
discipline the the other constant one

803
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,480
type out a little bit is called anti

804
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:36,600
fragile you guys and I may know if you

805
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,330
have a garden that sometimes there's

806
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,790
weeds you try and cut the top down in

807
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:45,029
five more come up that's what we should

808
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:48,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">be we calm dandelions you know is don't</font>

809
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:52,890

810
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:56,160
word from somebody take you down you

weed because we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the truth</font>

815
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:12,630
we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the good engineering</font>

816
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:19,530
it's not about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not</font>

817
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:20,880

821
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:30,510
logical fallacies<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

822
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:32,940
sometimes and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> say its authority</font>

823
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:36,720
the right this person says it so it has

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be right well maybe maybe not you</font>

825
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,100
know in engineering you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

826
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:43,100
prove that that it's it's good or not

827
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,960
you know I has nothing to do with it

828
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,720
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cultures are very traditional and</font>

829
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,760
that's fine is fine just because you've

830
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,330
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> done it a certain way doesn't</font>

831
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:58,200
make it right especially in innovation

832
00:48:54,330 --> 00:49:01,440
in engineering bandwagon just because

833
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:04,379
everybody in the room is humming one way

834
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,080
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right totally feel</font>

835

00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,670
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some cultural things I come</font>

841
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:35,580
from an Asian culture that values group

842
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,010
harmony nothing wrong with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

843
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:42,029
harmony is very good group effort is

844
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:44,400
very good having said that it's okay not

845
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:47,940
to be part of a group sometimes it's

846
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:53,790
okay to disagree again you have some

847
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:56,220
have a reason yeah not there are

848
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,770
cultures that respect their elders very

849
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:01,200
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good thing to have respect for</font>

850
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:05,070
your elders does not mean they're always

851
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,370
right that will hold you back innovation

852
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:10,020
doesn't come from always respecting your

853
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:14,630
elders we would never have<font color="#E5E5E5"> left the</font>

854
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,630
caves if we always stayed in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

855
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:24,540
some some cultures have a high structure

856
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:29,040
they say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how we are we have a</font>

857
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:32,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">system and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some many ways to look</font>

858
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,230
at it cast Confucian you know you have a

859
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:37,710
structure and there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with</font>

860
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:40,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that again it's very non-western but</font>

861
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:42,690
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of safety in</font>

862
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,820
instructor it's very peaceful as I say I

863
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:49,170
come from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asian culture high</font>

864
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:52,950
structure is can be very very um there's

865
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:58,800
a grounding having said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having said</font>

866
00:50:52,950 --> 00:51:01,890
that don't be afraid to leave the

867
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,200
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rough consensus is the</font>

868
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:07,080
decider of what's truth and if you get

869
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:10,009
that many people from that many

870
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:13,380
different areas that many points<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view</font>

871
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:17,760
who pretty much agree that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

872
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:21,870
right solution it's probably right it's

873
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:28,740
probably approaching the right thing to

874
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:31,290
do there are cultures that value

875
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:34,129
individual achievement very good very

876
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:37,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine to have individual achievement</font>

877
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:40,890
having said that it doesn't mean don't

878
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,800
collaborate some people who value that

879
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:46,770
you have to get the opinion of the group

880
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:50,400
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard for some individualistic</font>

881
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:53,880
cultures to think that the group can no

882
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:59,940
more than them and oftentimes the group

883
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:02,990
will know more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you oh the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

884
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:07,410
thing about individualistic cultures is

885
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:11,100
sometimes um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

886
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:13,740
aggressive in the point of in proposing

887
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,470
your ideas that can be very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

888
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">can feel very harsh to people who come</font>

889
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:23,759
from more group oriented cultures so as

890
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,430
I say we're all we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

891
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,920
together week if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we can't add</font>

892
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:30,779
electrical sockets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work we've</font>

893
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:34,290
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with each other and so we</font>

894
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:39,600
need to think about our<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we're with</font>

895
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:42,420
each other and and being that aggressive

896
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,190
sometimes means people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not hearing</font>

897
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,870
what you're saying and you're not

898
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:54,260
getting through

899
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:55,759
so as I say collaboration is it sorry

900
00:52:54,260 --> 00:53:00,230
we've had to kind of rush through these

901
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:04,040
last ones collaborations is is very very

902
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:07,940
important for these individualistic

903
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:11,180
cultures when we talk about being equal

904
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:13,970
it doesn't mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're the same it</font>

905
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:20,240
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't a right to your</font>

906
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:22,609
point of view and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

907
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,490
heard that we reject Kings presidents

908
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:28,100
and voting we believe in rough consensus

909
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:32,299
and running code that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very</font>

910
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:34,690
important ideal of up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF and and</font>

911
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:42,980
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with the fundamental</font>

912
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:45,860
non-hierarchical and equal care very

913
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:52,730
much about what you're doing as I say

914
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:54,890
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will know collaboration and</font>

915
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,810
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> others that's him we've</font>

916
00:53:54,890 --> 00:54:00,970
talked a lot about this sorry that I had

917
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:04,759
their wanna go faster these last ones if

918
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:07,399
you make a mistake then admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

919
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,830
you can see there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of a</font>

920
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:13,340
slide from an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email from somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font>

921
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:16,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very very strong contributor and and</font>

922
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:19,090
he said very maturely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I reacted to</font>

923
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:22,220
what you said I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wrong that</font>

924
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:24,500
that keeps the flow going don't be

925
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,689
afraid don't be afraid to say I made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

926
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:31,370
mistake or don't be afraid to say I'm

927
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:33,920
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revise what I do be a team</font>

928
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:37,339
player that means if you don't need

929
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,980
agenda time like<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now there's i get</font>

930

934
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:55,240
people will give it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so so don't</font>

935
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:58,460
don't ask for more than you need this

936
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,859
there's notable notable results of

937
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,020
collab

938
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:04,980

977
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,500
something you can look up even on

978
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:07,049
Wikipedia it's called a collaborative

979
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,070
innovation network and some people feel

980
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:12,700
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the IETF is is a is a</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ietf is an example of this kind of</font>
