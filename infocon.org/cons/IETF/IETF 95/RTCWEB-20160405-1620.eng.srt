can you do that the gist is that things

49
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,070
are going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> recorded both audio and</font>

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,229
going on and you don't want to follow

53
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:01,510
this you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

54
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,560
next and here's our agenda I actually

55
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,940
uploaded a new version that's got some

56
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,620
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the dress that actually</font>

57
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,020
related to each of these but basically

58
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,430
we've got two days and today we're going

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of go through these and then the</font>

60
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,650

if we have time permitting we r to do a

65
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:41,600
SUV<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ngls yeah is there any agenda</font>

68
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:58,280
around oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we expect</font>

69
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,640
everything over everything that's I

70
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,780
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's correct in the agenda on the</font>

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,780
actually uploaded in the day tracker

72
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,700
someone mostly focus on the ones here

73
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,770
that are you know not already passed

74
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:58,740

75
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">is moving along audio is I think largely</font>

76
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:12,810
only hug them up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps this</font>

77
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:20,940

78
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:22,920
Cooper so on a LPN i sent a comments my

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,440
ad review but i don't believe i received

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,440
a response so it's not moving along fine

81
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:35,490
so so the latest the latest was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next the next version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the draft</font>

85
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,750
when you get the opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't</font>

99
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,800
second um audio codecs shut data channel

100
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,630
one of the many ones that's in the RFC

101

hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fifty three days um there's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hour savings just to draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ginning steps</font>

105
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,299
or something where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see all the</font>

106
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,209
dependency

107
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,790
is in interdependencies of the drafts

108
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:51,149
much of our stuff falls back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

109
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,060
blocked on all of it being done at once

110
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:55,890
at a certain degree so I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

111
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,349
ones exactly the data channels blocked

112
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,630
on it maybe the security which is

113
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,130
blocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other ones but we there's</font>

114
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,839
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documents they're just</font>

115
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,839
blocked on references<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will probably</font>

116
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,180
continue that way until some of the long

117
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,670
until the ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> straps including the ice</font>

118
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,099
trickle drafts complete until the chase

119
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,849
updraft completes which the you see

120
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:22,709
those offers<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurry up you see the ones</font>

121
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:29,370
you want to listen cover these awesome

122
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:31,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">went yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just do we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

123
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">about we talked about the security thing</font>

124
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,140
last time right so just on the data

125
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:38,760
channel kind a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian grows with</font>

126
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,829
regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the data channel draft I</font>

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,410
think it falls down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ctp end</font>

128
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:47,359
data as being one of the critical drafts

129
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:50,069
and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the tsv session this</font>

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,440
prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this that should be going to</font>

131
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">working great working group last call in</font>

132
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,020
a couple of weeks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully get some</font>

133
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,020
movement on that

134
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,219
subscription so so the security drops

135
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:07,660
the security drafts you remember last

136
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,920
time we did kind of like a foot scrape

137
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,629
through the outstanding comments and

138
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,750
basically it's trying to get some very

139
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:18,279
busy people's time to do some updates I

140
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,079
guess when I talked with him last they

141
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,220
basically said we're like ninety-eight

142
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,019
percent of the way there we dated a

143
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,579
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweets we're not going to</font>

144
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:29,860
rewrite the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire draft based on</font>

145
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:31,449
comments from I guess apps area so what

146
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:35,110
was it happened it was still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in apps</font>

167
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:52,329
you're mucking around mum Thompson

168
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,949
fluffy asked me to have a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font>

169
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:56,529
of the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> sections of these</font>

170
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:58,689
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I did and unfortunately</font>

171
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,199
I'm too close to all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and I'm</font>

172
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:04,709
unable to see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problems that I</font>

173
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:09,269
would expect that a no doubt there yet

174
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:14,559
so I need I need help on that as well so

175
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm sure that the Sean will do an</font>

176
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,100
excellent job

177
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,890
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find someone</font>

178
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to step up that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great too</font>

179
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,820
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian I noticed that you arrived late</font>

180
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:36,840
and weren't paying attention just<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

181
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:39,670
would you care to volunteer maybe yeah

182
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,470
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to go find Martin</font>

183
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,240
asked Martin what sections of a

184
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,920
particular graph to talk about identity

185
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,600
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> review by somebody who hasn't</font>

186
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,530
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it a lot I think you qualify</font>

187
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,810
would you be interested sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right</font>

188
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:55,390
Ian's name down is another pressed into

189
00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:08,500
service possibly not actual volunteer

190
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:10,569
thank you very much this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

191
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,340
claiming to be in Miss ref it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

192
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:18,000
in yet another last call so sorry

193
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,200
disambiguating that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTP usage</font>

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,780
interestingly enough the state tracker

195
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:27,040
doesn't have a please stop bothering me

196
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,449
state but if it did surely we would be

197
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,370
the highest user of it among current art

198
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,700
working groups but this this went back

199
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:38,830
into a last call after a small number of

200
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,920
editorial and not so editorial changes

201
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,810
so it's in working group / IETF last

202
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,670
call so far everything's going

203
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,349
swimmingly and we certainly expect it to

204
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,110
continue so at which<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it will</font>

205
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:54,520
return to its current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state just look at</font>

206
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,890
it depends on worth noting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> treaty</font>

207
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:05,800
depends reference wise on<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTP multi</font>

208
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">stream and multi stream optimization so</font>

209
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Weston or throw them on the</font>

210
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,190
stream and must assume of my session

211
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,320
which documents are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dorset askew and</font>

212
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:20,170
its dependence a bundle this that's why

213
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:26,760
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not published so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

214
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds good okay how do we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

215
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:37,810
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main ones okay I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

216
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,220
as a point of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean like you</font>

217
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,899
look you see all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not done</font>

218
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,320
but just in a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff that it</font>

219
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:48,399
has gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> that um when you go and like</font>

220
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,779
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I mean in the list of drafts</font>

221
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,560
we've been tracking as part of this

222
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:56,709
working group I'm were up to 20

223
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,029
published RF seeds and not directly from

224
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:01,839
this working group but the pen of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

225
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,820
WebRTC work as a whole we're in a bunch

226
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,310
that are a past last call like probably

227
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">over half another 20 maybe and another</font>

228
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:12,010
you know 10 or so that are not yet at

229
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,540
working group last call so we're closing

230
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:25,569
in on the end here okay we can see the

231
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">light</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end of the tunnel oncoming</font>

232
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:37,290
train so Justin

233
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,410
okay it should be brief I managed to

234
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,810
misspell or miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrange the words in</font>

235
00:15:51,410 --> 00:16:00,380
the slide title of the actual draft name

236
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:05,750
yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't look for that</font>

237
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:07,670
document name anyway next so Magnus gave

238
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:11,060
this a very thorough review thanks very

239
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,290
much I fixed basically the things he

240
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,900
found as well as some of the remaining

241
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,839
to do is in the document others one of

242
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,670
the things that was missing was actually

243
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,250
what the overhead is of using fact the

244
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,260
internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oprah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spec we found out about</font>

245
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,060
twenty to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty percent which is</font>

246
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,040
actually much better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

247
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible mechanisms so it's noted in the</font>

248
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,420
document I also mentioned some the

249
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">limitations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Opus but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in effect</font>

250
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,229
mainly that you can only protect the

251
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,620
previous audio frame you can't do multi

252
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,320
packet fact with the built-in opus<font color="#E5E5E5"> faq</font>

253
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:48,380
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you wrote back</font>

254
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:51,560
to RFC 2198 style fact also Magnus asked

255
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,910
for discussion of AMR m-ary band because

256
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,829
those are things in their recommended

257
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,650
audio codecs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop document which</font>

258
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,970
is a working group document so those are

259
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,840
now covered as well as the various

260
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:05,569
mechanisms that exist for for AMR and

261
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,360
also now that we have flex pack which

262
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,429
doesn't require the SSRC be indicated in

263
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:12,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">stp this is indicated within the actual</font>

264
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,350
payload we no longer need to include

265
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,080
discussion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSRC group and a equals us</font>

266
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,730
is actually attributes in this document

267
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:28,750
and it describes how i expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for</font>

268
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:31,100
the demultiplexing next so open issues

269
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,570
really they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there the one</font>

270
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,399
that still remains in the document is

271
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,220
what if anything do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say about</font>

272
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,790
signaling support for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact in a mar y</font>

273
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,230
band morena rmr there are a bunch of

274
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,820
various attributes that are fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

275
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,580
more document but there doesn't seem to

276
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,679
be anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is like on/off switch</font>

277
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,139
that's similar to opuses use in band

278
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,280
feck so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to sort of get people who</font>

279
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,000
knew more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more to comment on</font>

280
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,260
this so on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason why it's doesn't</font>

282
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,010
signaling is that the receiver side

283
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:07,280
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of mandatory and</font>

284
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,800
implicit so that they have support to

285
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,300
accept it so you the same they can

286
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">always choose to use it towards the</font>

287
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,580
receiver excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well if that's</font>

288
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,800
the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's mandatory to implement</font>

289
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,070
then they know we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> any text</font>

290
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,990
here which is what i was hoping there's

291
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,850
also this max red parameter and AMR

292
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">originality to indicate like what's the</font>

293
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,469
maximum depth of the fact that we should

294
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,330
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seems like that could be</font>

295
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,130
arbitrary we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make any</font>

296
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,570
statement here this document so i

297
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:45,770
recommend just not saying anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

298
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:48,980
you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not say</font>

299
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:50,210
anything about the what needs to be

300
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,600
signal to indicate you can in fact

301
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:59,990
receive a mark wipe in fact and we won't

302
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:02,570
say anything about macs read either so

303
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:04,490
with that I will basically strike that

304
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:10,100
last to do and i believe the doctor will

305
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:11,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">be ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for last call just to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

306
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,280
like Magnus is the only person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font>

307
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,870
you know review the document indicate in

308
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">detail so if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have additional</font>

309
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:28,000
reviews before last call I guess we

310
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:34,100
could call<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so Justin</font>

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,900
yes so about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Max read I mean that puffed</font>

312
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,399
role in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense for I more can</font>

313
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,980
actually indicate that you wouldn't like

314
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,830
to receive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've done this at all</font>

315
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:46,820
so but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASA negotiation factor so</font>

316
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:50,210
how much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use itself or so besides I</font>

317
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,950
mean so are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying i thought the</font>

318
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">offer needs to consider the case where</font>

319
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,520
receives max rate equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero or you're</font>

320
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that the offer should also</font>

321
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,840
indicate some max red good question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

322
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,310
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's the receiver it's just</font>

323
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,020
pursue based<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to go review it</font>

324
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,639
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it actually looks so but</font>

325
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,400
it's can tell

326
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,650
it afterwards you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that</font>

327
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,870
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something dessert that I need</font>

328
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it may the doctrine says</font>

329
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,729
for mr says that if no value is<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

330
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,679
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's senators discretion yeah</font>

331
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,120
and that really feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's the</font>

332
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,770
appropriate thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we could have</font>

333
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,959
some note saying that if you receive a

334
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:34,760
value of zero for max red then don't

335
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:38,090
send fact but that's already kind of

336
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,670
redundant in some ways so if you want to

337
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:42,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and report back I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

338
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,210
look it doesn't think the max red

339
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,370
parameter sexually especially in like

340
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:50,960
interoperability case two words 50p be

341
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:53,870
empty SI assistance is settle it might

342
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,430
actually use this parameter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some</font>

343
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,439
argument then change that to indicate

344
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:00,820
that Magnus will go investigate this and

345
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,990
you know let<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what we should do</font>

346
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,210
so clearly it would be nice to have a

347
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:07,370
couple of focused reviews of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

348
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,200
we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to working group last call</font>

349
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,699
staring out into the number of people

350
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,630
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are staring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at their screens I'm</font>

351
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,520
thinking Tim could we ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

352
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:25,550
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so Tim mow and moe one more</font>

353
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:27,320
who knows another than a bit and anybody

354
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,200
else want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually raise their hand</font>

355
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:35,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">and not force me to call her oh come on</font>

356
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:43,550
now very short document really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tiny all</font>

357
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:45,080
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you hey Justin can you say</font>

358
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything about implementation status of</font>

359
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:56,090
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys implemented so we</font>

360
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,980
support the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Opus and ban pack and we</font>

361
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:01,520
support we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> support the flex back</font>

362
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,070
yet so we support the recommended modes

363
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,450
for audio within the wafer opus

364
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,689
basically and that's that's really about

365
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,690
it

366
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,199
so we got one<font color="#CCCCCC"> more volunteer from the</font>

383
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,500
of you reading email and we discussed in

384
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,049
Yokohama this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall goal we</font>

385
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,890
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to cheap at this document</font>

386
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,750
there are a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> goals</font>

387
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,490
that we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

388
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,530
priority of the main thing is prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

389
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,480
dropped web pages from drive by

390
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:39,928
gathering addresses using it for

391
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,659
identifying if you were on a VPN we also

392
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:45,390
had a very strong sort of goal to make

393
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:47,039
sure that at least England<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is on by</font>

394
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,909
default I didn't degrade after

395
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,289
performance I in actual railroad cases

396
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:54,299
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually roll this out by default</font>

397
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,100
in chrome recently and found that it did

398
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">not in fact degrade performance which</font>

399
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,408
was which was great and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> give users</font>

400
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,179
control that if they didn't like the

401
00:24:01,409 --> 00:24:05,850
defaults and when you did additional

402
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:07,380
privacy you know behavior there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

403
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined ways of what they could actually</font>

404
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,409
do that next so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we came up</font>

405
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:16,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a solution space you know</font>

406
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically four different modes and most</font>

407
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:21,000
one and two or default and those are

408
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">predicated based on whether the the</font>

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual application has received</font>

410
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,290
permission from the user and then the

411
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,210
option about three

412
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,520
for could be optionally enabled by the

413
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,280
user if they want additional control

414
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,960
over which IP addresses are disclosed

415
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:40,050
next so since<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yokohama received detailed</font>

416
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,250
review from Adam and Wendy Wendy

417
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:45,300
especially from the privacy perspective

418
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,430
and overall very positive reviews Adam

419
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,750
had a lot of text and other because

420
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,050
suggestions that were now incorporated

421
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,000
into this most recent document in

422
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably the most</font>

423
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">substantial change and I'll talk about</font>

424
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,770
this in detail later was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> part where</font>

425
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,600
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about why couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

426
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,850
permission with camera and mic

427
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,330
permission it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hand waited</font>

428
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:12,300
before now thanks to Adam it's you know

429
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:15,270
I'm were a more robust argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll</font>

430
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:18,300
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in a future slide also</font>

431
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:20,820
discussion of why we have proxies that

432
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,550
aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP proxies on a about that</font>

433
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,230
in more detail later as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and a bunch</font>

434
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:27,409
of references and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

435
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:34,290
editorial things that I'm turned<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

436
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:36,320
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'll let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for</font>

437
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,389
a little bit the main thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

438
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,879
the old um tax base and made a bit of a

439
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:43,620
hand wavy thing about how you know

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,030
access to the actual video camera

441
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,129
information is more sensitive than the

442
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,149
IP address information and therefore I

443
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,200
you know the just coupling you know

444
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,380
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> should follow directly from</font>

445
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,000
that on the new text basically explains

446
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,310
a bit more like how we arrived here

447
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">namely that you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

448
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,760
difficult thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of explain to</font>

449
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,600
users and that we found like you know

450
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,960
after considering all the possibilities

451
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,459
this actually made the most sense and

452
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,170
the folks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ping working group</font>

453
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,170
thought this made a lot of sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

454
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,580
anybody objects with this now be time to

455
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,889
speak so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear this is exactly the</font>

456
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,330
same functional thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just with differ</font>

457
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">explanatory justification yes it is</font>

458
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:33,720
perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one slightly salient point</font>

459
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,550
here would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that perhaps like</font>

460
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,960
the it gives my advice to user agents

461
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,000
that they should indicate they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font>

462
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,510
in the prompt for<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident for</font>

464
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,320
permissions<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention the IP gathering</font>

465
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,790
stuff so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spelled out yes</font>

466
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,409
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second sentence that we say the</font>

467
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,879
permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> granted you probably also</font>

468
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:54,050
make mention this but if it is worded

469
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,610
sort of carefully not that it gives the

470
00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:04,280
fair amount of discretion right right so

471
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:07,340
with Cullen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenny so as individual i did</font>

472
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,649
this may be a w3c issue or even a non

473
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,959
standards issue a UI type issue but

474
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,400
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these need to get it sort</font>

475
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,990
of accessible privacy thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want</font>

476
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of say i mean i can hop the</font>

477
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,920
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all phrased</font>

478
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:20,510
but if it's like it is right now where

479
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,030
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked to use my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video camera</font>

480
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,980
and then that grants something that

481
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:27,800
people thinks reveals a lot about my

482
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,920
location I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the argument</font>

483
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,440
that your video<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera is more sensitive</font>

484
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,970
than your location therefore if you've

485
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,680
got permission for the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera</font>

486
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,870
you'd get permission for the location<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

487
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,210
don't buy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument if the grant is</font>

488
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:43,729
for video and location and microphone

489
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:45,830
all combined in one yes no objection to

490
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,690
that that type of idea at all but I

491
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow make sure</font>

492
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,300
that the permission being granted

493
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:55,959
relates to the attack that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is changed by</font>

494
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,389
whether that grants permitted or not

495
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:02,360
right so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the new text</font>

496
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,950
should address exactly that concern it

497
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,260
does it's not very prescriptive and how

498
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,550
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> user agent should do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

499
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a w3c you matter</font>

500
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,419
perhaps but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it captures exactly</font>

501
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,780
the sentiment you're expressing which is

502
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,360
that yes that coupling is not clear and

503
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">that should be sort of handled by the</font>

504
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,250
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> user asian all right you know and</font>

505
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,720
start you know indicating that to the

506
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,890
user somehow right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't want</font>

507
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,480
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who thinks they put a piece of</font>

508
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,970
tape over their camera to think they can

509
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,580
automatically hit OK to this with no no

510
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,600
impact to them right and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

511
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,429
question about what the text of the

512
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,379
prompt says which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree is not</font>

513
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:39,080
something this drab should specify but

514
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm so maybe it does buddy right you

515
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:49,699
know yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> mountain Thompson I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

516
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know a solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then what you</font>

517
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,110
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> written</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

518
00:28:50,450 --> 00:29:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">riva but i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're able to</font>

519
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:01,909
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that information in a prompt right</font>

520
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:07,129
which leads me to ask the question that

521
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:08,690
do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can so I think</font>

522
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I we need to kind of</font>

523
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,280
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot of research you know</font>

524
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,630
and I what would be in a like where

525
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">would people actually understand I</font>

526
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,890
certainly saying do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust phu kham</font>

527
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,120
to access your microphone camera and

528
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,830
enumerate all your network interfaces

529
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,699
attached to your computer is probably

530
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,639
not the right prompt right and oh by the

531
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,440
way you write<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

532
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,270
have attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> over or the audio video</font>

533
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,730
devices have attached which happens to

534
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:43,310
include<font color="#CCCCCC"> displays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and other output</font>

535
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:47,150
devices but yes unless it could wear as

536
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:49,429
an individual um I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like such</font>

537
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,750
a slippery slope to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

538
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this in this draft because I mean you</font>

539
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,230
the way you can read this is actually

540
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">not that anything would change about the</font>

541
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:03,580
prompt at all it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

542
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:06,590
what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that implicitly</font>

543
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,620
when you accept a prompt that asks you

544
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:12,139
about the camera and microphone most

545
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,300
people are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the</font>

546
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:22,670
addition of their local addresses as

547
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:25,070
well right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I don't actually</font>

548
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the words here that say this will</font>

549
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:40,310
appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prompt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i guess the</font>

550
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,500
real issue that i have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

551
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:46,310
certainly cases where that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not true at</font>

552
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right like where you're totally fine</font>

553
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,560
sharing your video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

554
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,850
totally fine sharing your location and

555
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,129
so if you're going to go down the path

556
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:58,340
talking about this then you also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

557
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,170
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's unpleasant</font>

558
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,790
because we don't want to talk about all

559
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,660
these different cases when we have

560
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,440
nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do with about them really</font>

561
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,210
but you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the false</font>

562
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,740
impression that that's not a real case

563
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,420
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a real case sorry I mean</font>

564
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,040
that the jacketing does sort of consider

565
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,990
the whole purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those documents the</font>

566
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,990
basic consider these cases so<font color="#CCCCCC"> III think</font>

567
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the doctrine does you know least try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

568
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,250
consider you know that the balance of

569
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,110
trying to be you eat out here of you

570
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,940
know how we can sort of hassle neither

571
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:33,979
understandable and also provide the

572
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:34,940
privacy protection that we desire on you

573
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,620
know it's not trying to be super

574
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,000
prescriptive on exactly what you I is

575
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,340
put in front of user because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

576
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the</font>

577
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,590
scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crew but as far as like</font>

578
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:48,140
making it clear that it's not ideal I

579
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:50,959
certainly think the new text is better

580
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,430
than the old text and you know perhaps

581
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,230
are some things the new text we would

582
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:56,240
want to consider it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordsmiths</font>

583
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,610
more but I think it does try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of</font>

584
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,500
explain that yes is not a simple thing

585
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,000
like yes if you're gonna give video that

586
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,030
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that it's okay to give</font>

587
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,170
you know your network information and

588
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:09,500
you know we could sort of mitigate

589
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,300
exactly what does expanding the consent

590
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,370
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> closer than the network question</font>

591
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Korean exactly mean but I think I don't</font>

592
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,739
think we could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> super prescriptive so</font>

593
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,199
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> life so would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you be okay with</font>

594
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,370
saying explicitly include I think the

595
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that people are having is that</font>

596
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:28,100
it is an implicit inclusion in some of

597
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,030
these cases and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result of</font>

598
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,620
which they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't believe people</font>

599
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:33,110
understand what's being consented to if

600
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:36,020
it said explicit would you be okay and

601
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:38,870
would they be okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he I'm not</font>

602
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:42,400
understand your puzzle if we said here

603
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:44,949
that this permission grant expanded to

604
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:49,570
explicitly include consent to allow

605
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">WebRTC to so that the consent change on</font>

606
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,800
camera and microphone to camera

607
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,230
microphone network location was an

608
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,730
explicit part of the consent however

609
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,950
that's presenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I that's outside</font>

610
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our thing would that change your</font>

611
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,760
opinion of where we are but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

612
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole point is that it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

613
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,330
explicit and that everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> agrees that</font>

614
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,540
it there's no good way to explain this

615
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:13,189
so it won't be made explicit then I

616
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,330
don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> what proposal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

617
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">making because I thought you were</font>

618
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,669
proposing that it be made explicit I am

619
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:23,000
not proposing that what I'm proposing is

620
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:25,160
that I think I think I'm in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> realm of</font>

621
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,880
the word smithing to make clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

622
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:36,740
this is one case and that maybe even not

623
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,180
even the general case I don't know well

624
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,400
you say one case versus the general case

625
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,950
like what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play in</font>

626
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,800
mine the case where I'm location sharing

627
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,500
my video<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not my location right so</font>

628
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,940
like in one of the ways that we've tried

629
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to approach this is by having the other</font>

630
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">modes that people who knowingly are in</font>

631
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">those cases could use to have that</font>

632
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,940
specific control like that no

633
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,410
information that would perhaps being

634
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,040
location sensitive would ever be given

635
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,780
out but whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be done like</font>

636
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,210
whether whether that can be intimated in

637
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:12,139
a prompt<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really i got</font>

638
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:18,440
unresolved question yeah probably not I

639
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:20,569
guess I I think my mum view of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

640
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,370
is this is a tool that it's into a

641
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,170
bigger city and the only thing that we

642
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,020
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really evaluate is whether the</font>

643
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:29,450
privacy characters of the whole system

644
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:31,280
so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think whether i think this</font>

645
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:32,629
weather i support this as is or not

646
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,650
depends little the rest of the system

647
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,300
looks like and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

648
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">revolve that along a little bit and see</font>

649
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,880
it but if it's a system where no saint

650
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,409
user would think there was any location

651
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,430
thing here there then I don't think

652
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,230
we're protecting anything in this

653
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,000
solution is inappropriate because either

654
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,219
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about protecting anything</font>

655
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,690
in which case it should just be a

656
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:52,219
different mode or you do care about

657
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,020
protecting it in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> case this fails</font>

658
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:55,549
to protect it so I'm just sort of

659
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,259
flagging that as we see how the whole

660
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,260
solution I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft of</font>

661
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:03,230
text and most three and four the fact

662
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,820
that browsers are providing api's for

663
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,020
things that definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they want to</font>

664
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:10,370
be in a certain mode like tor browser

665
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:12,590
tor button are great but whether the

666
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,930
default in stream privacy whether this

667
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,850
works or not is hard to say without

668
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,299
understanding what the prompts going to

669
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,520
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the rest of the pieces</font>

670
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,080
right I guess I'd the remit of this

671
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,690
working group to be designing UI for

672
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,080
browsers totally but evaluating whether

673
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,350
this works or not to meet the privacy

674
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,640
idea is within the context of the system

675
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be used in which includes</font>

676
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,609
that that's all I'm saying it's hard I'm

677
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,080
not saying you should design the prompt

678
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,540
at all sure I'm saying we need to

679
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,819
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pump a little bit if the</font>

680
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:47,529
prompts what that prompt look like would

681
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:49,510
greatly influenced this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire</font>

682
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:53,320
all this Chum speaking to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> separation</font>

683
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:56,980
of concerns idea and I believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

684
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,410
is that the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what advice to</font>

685
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:07,810
give to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i implement this system is</font>

686
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:11,980
an area where which the w3c<font color="#E5E5E5"> has other</font>

687
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:14,830
sites and given a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thought to and</font>

688
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,590
has generally come down on saying no you

689
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:22,090
can't dictate to what the you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

690
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:26,380
be you will you have to write a bison on

691
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:32,800
what you want the UI to accomplish and I

692
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:35,860
think that and point one we should heed

693
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,670
that and say what we want to accomplish

694
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:43,600
rather than the UI should look like and

695
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:46,000
by 2 and the details of the one level

696
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:52,509
detail down should be in the eye in a WC

697
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,160
documents not in the IDF<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment ah I'm</font>

698
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:59,260
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little surprise for having</font>

699
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:01,270
this discussion so sick well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay six</font>

700
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,390
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we were like all totally cool</font>

701
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,870
with just excellent rating all this data

702
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:10,660
any piece of JavaScript on the web and

703
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,190
so so we're now discussing the

704
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,259
conditions under which we will not

705
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:15,610
expose right it also at the same data

706
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,030
which we were totally cool with six

707
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:20,740
months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> like exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what level of</font>

708
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,240
inform user consent we want easier to

709
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:27,160
give on similarly when we discuss this

710
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,850
last time I think there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> an uneasy</font>

711
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:32,140
agreement that they're really user not

00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,960
product and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no sane person could</font>

714
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,160
possibly have explained to them like

715
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,900
this is going to reveal the IP address

716
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some problem to make any sense of it</font>

717
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,300
I mean

718
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,100
fine if there's some ?<font color="#E5E5E5"> they click to and</font>

720
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:51,650
a bailment and advising liability it

721
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,750
also says<font color="#E5E5E5"> there goes your IP address but</font>

722
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:57,920
like it's clearly not going to go in the

00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:59,810
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> deck so maybe people have some</font>

724
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,130
material objection to warn those two

725
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,170
statements and think that the system

726
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:06,350
should behave differently if so<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

727
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:08,240
great if the issue is that the rationale

728
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:11,180
it just happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to club here for why</font>

729
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,870
this quite yucky but nevertheless I

730
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,100
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reasonable compromise is reached</font>

731
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:19,310
that's like really quite different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

732
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,049
if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the objection then let's just</font>

was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good move this text entirely and</font>

735
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,480
by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should be clear but if</font>

every simply move this text entirely and

738
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:38,360
say you know browsers are encouraged to

to get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> obtain some method of</font>

this is it how's this is far too much

758

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Colin wants to have us have this</font>

the user that but this is not a driveby

766
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:54,050
situation and one of those potential

767
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,259
signals is the fact that they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given</font>

768
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,380
access to camera

or even geolocation if it comes to that

770
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,870
because honestly I don't see I see that

771
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,140
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far far better correlated with with</font>

the IP addressing than saving my camera

773
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,710
microphone I actually thought about that

774
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I thought that like I can't imagine</font>

775
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,820
the communications at really asking from

776
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,110
location in a way that the user not

777
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,900
really no that's not the point of making

778
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that the the browser has</font>

779
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,970
received some signal from the user that

780
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not this is this is an</font>

781
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,589

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case you've given them</font>

extraordinarily exceptional thing sure

785
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:39,250
right on the web and so that is that is

786
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,200
a signal that the browser can confuse to

787
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,990
interpret as saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe these</font>

790
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,360
ballot about driving force here and I

791
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,800
think that the problem we're having is

792
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,690
that since<font color="#E5E5E5"> that covers like ninety-nine</font>

793
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,000
percent of the overall sort of intent

794
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">does a camera the case where I did one</font>

795
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,850
percent where someone says oh well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

796
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want i wanna use this app but i</font>

797
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,569
don't want to give away up my location

798
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,100
information and like you know i'm not

799
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will ever be i probably can</font>

800
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:12,910
perfectly resolved and we all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

801
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,920
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the other modes which is the</font>

802
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,980
intent of this document atom to atom

803
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,380
roach the horse was not dead when I got

804
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,790

805
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,280
think the second sentence here actually

806
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,680
does go as far as the ITF really has in

807
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,060
its remit I think that you know saying

808
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:30,460
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a combined</font>

809
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:32,890
grant is all we really need and then

810
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:35,290
this specification of how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grant is</font>

811
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,879
presented to something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more w3</font>

812
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:39,100
and implementation and I know I think

813
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">this gives enough of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hole to throw it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">over the wall w3 and have the final bits</font>

816
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,020
not really seeing how difficult this is

817
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:56,950
because I look at today I pop<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

Firefox page in and start web RTC it

819
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,419
gives me you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you consent to</font>

the third both the network addresses

824
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:13,060
all our own primary it seems so simple

825
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:15,880
and even if you don't allow selection or

826
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,799
explicit consent to be combined at least

827
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,660
having notification that when you're

828

showing these things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

829
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,470
your network address that seems to me to

830
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,930
be a simple thing that most users would

831
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,430
understand and it's not rocket science

832
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:32,259
for use we figure out what they're what

<font color="#E5E5E5">which are not going to be used and the</font>

853
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:42,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">information which therefore leaks about</font>

854
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:44,470
you and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not really the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the attempt in in the left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand side to</font>

856
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:49,450
say they're much more sensitive that I

857
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,510
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very right to focus on</font>

858
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">other things than to try and expand it</font>

859
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,480
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think ecker is right that</font>

860
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,390
ultimately you'd be better off without

861
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,390
any of that and simply to say hey in

862
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,580
mode 1 we try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

863
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:08,310
addresses and they are therefore out

864
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:12,190
revealed in mode 2 we we use only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

865
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:14,410
specific set of addresses or or resolver

866
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,000
or or turn servers and those are

867
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,920
therefore revealed and then three and

868
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">four we provide the api's for other</font>

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:29,230
two kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information just isn't</font>

872
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:31,090
there and I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what alyssa was</font>

873
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:33,370
saying earlier when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i finally understood</font>

874
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,290
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're on a chat server and</font>

875
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:38,319
playing Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> medley or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chat roulette or</font>

876
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:40,210
sex camming or whatever you may very

877
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,640
well be willing to show somebody your

878
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,230
face or your genitals and not be willing

879
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">to let them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that you're in the dorm</font>

880
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:50,710
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> three three blocks away right it's</font>

881
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:52,660
a very different thing and if you if you

882
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,520
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relate them you're going to</font>

883
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,649
always be in this muddy moment and I

884
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,490
think not trying to relate them and

885
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:03,070
simply exposing in in the modes what

886
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,049
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is is fundamentally better</font>

887
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,330
off so I would personally rip this all

888
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,730
out so Ted I the doctrine does specify

889
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:13,420
exactly what no it doesn't need to do

890
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:15,340
this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I said at some point</font>

891
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,420
in only its the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc and tries to say</font>

892
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,830
here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the default ought to be and</font>

893
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,710
are you proposing that we walk back that

894
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:25,120
notion of having a default or no and I

895
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:27,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">still think the default you have is fun</font>

896
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,670
but I am trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that trying to</font>

897
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what the default permission</font>

898
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:36,310
is for the locate network location

899
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:40,750
related pieces of privacy sense of

900
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:43,660
information from the privacy sensitivity

901
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:49,240
of the media is the wrong analysis to

902
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:53,799
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand what</font>

903
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:58,419
how we can make have a default and not

904
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,800
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that question and this</font>

905
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,210
how I ended up here is because he didn't

906
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,950
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a strong signal we could use</font>

907
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:06,970
and this was the strongest signal and as

908
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:09,069
Eric pointed out this covers Alyssa

909
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:12,609
Cooper so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with everything Ted</font>

910
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:15,370
said I think the point is do not justify

911
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:18,310
your default based on tying these two

912
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:22,270
notions together you just have to pick a

913
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:25,380
default that's it don't justify it based

914
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:28,270
on some relationship that doesn't exist

915
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,220
just pick and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say that the</font>

916
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">default is being picked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because in a</font>

917
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:35,290
common case we prefer network latency

918
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,240
advantage

919
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,250
over privacy and that the non-common

920
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:45,279
cases make other choices and that's

921
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:47,230
enough so okay I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> really take</font>

922
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">another shot of this say we said that</font>

923
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:53,440
being like mode 2 1st Armored long

924
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,840
because it provides these latency

925
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,260
advantages but also is behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> in least</font>

926
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,720
some consent rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero consent</font>

927
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:06,340
which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drive-by case like</font>

928
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:08,109
is that going too far I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

929
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,050
happy if I mean I basically returning

930
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:13,750
the text that was more similar to the

931
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,280
original texts of striking the whole you

932
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,920
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of rationale about well it's</font>

933
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,170
more sensitive it would basically be the

934
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">old text you know minus the sort of</font>

935
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">bullet a statement almost if nobody</font>

936
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:27,910
believes that there's any reasonable way

937
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,830
to obtain informed consent about this

938
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:32,740
then you shouldn't say anything about

939
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:35,080
consent and I don't think I mean other

940
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,149
than mo who just got up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said</font>

941
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:40,210
that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anybody actually</font>

942
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,130
believes that you can feasibly explain

943
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,930
this to someone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this context and have</font>

944
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,620
them agree to it and have it be

945
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,580
meaningful I mean I do agree I don't

946
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,810
think there's a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can put in</font>

947
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,160
front of users and get every small

948
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,830
response to so then they're not

949
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,990
consenting to any human that is movable

950
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,029
that's not a good practice to tell me

951
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:00,100
from environment I mean the user is

952
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,900
placing trust into the application by

953
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,290
consenting to allow them have access to

954
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,850
their camera and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly say</font>

955
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,590
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a site that has an</font>

956
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,360
explicit trust of some sort from the

957
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,510
user it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a more privileged</font>

958
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">state than that and one has no trust but</font>

959
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:20,350
that devolves back to this notion that

960
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:27,730
these things are related and they're

961
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:29,650
doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it seems like of the</font>

962
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:32,460
various we consider various options and

963
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,630
this was the least bad option and you

964
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,640
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's also very workable</font>

965
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,190
option you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually saw you know</font>

966
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,299
drive by usage of harvesting go down

967
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:44,050
substantially in chrome wants they

968
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,490
actually did this so I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

969
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:48,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if we if you look at this to</font>

970
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,229
carefully we may actually be kind of

971
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,640
overanalyzing and missing kind of like

972
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,310
the you know the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solve</font>

973
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,960
in the core problem here I mean so the

974
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,970
argument doesn't change the default the

975
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">argument is get rid of the false</font>

976
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:04,109
rationale by the default that's written

977
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,109
in the document that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

978
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:11,440
that's quite on the same page with

979
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:12,579
Alyssa um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so modes three and four</font>

980
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,720
are great you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into them with your</font>

981
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:17,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">sprint request so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only talking</font>

982
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,520
about the mode<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or mode 0 and whether</font>

983
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">a certain type what type of permission</font>

984
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,630
prompt might move you to those right and

985
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:28,500
what's the default behaviour the core

986
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:36,160
question one or two right okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry um</font>

987
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:37,150
oh sorry the other slides are drafts

988
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,279
they're numbered differently I

989
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:43,180
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm confused</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

990
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,890
one or two so um now for applications

991
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,569
particularly ones that are like a chat

992
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,129
application or<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer-to-peer application</font>

993
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:50,290
that don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any audio or video</font>

994
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:53,530
involved at all I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

995
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:55,029
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> real</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs of this requiring</font>

996
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,380
this permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe there's a sport</font>

997
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,940
and people will not grant it because

998
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,740
it'll just be creepy that your IM

999
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:02,440
applications act is asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for access to</font>

1000
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">your camera so there is impact on doing</font>

1001
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,619
that so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1002
00:50:03,609 --> 00:50:08,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've wondered about on this is we're</font>

1003
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:12,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to solve a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem which because</font>

1004
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:14,349
we can't explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if the network if we</font>

1005
00:50:12,369 --> 00:50:16,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">could explain network location in the</font>

1006
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:18,430
prompt and the words network location

1007
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,750
might work you're granting camera mic

1008
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,560
and network location that's three

1009
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:25,900
different things one thing or location<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1010
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,279
I be interesting someone really dig in

1011
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,960
deep and see whether actually users

1012
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,069
could comprehend that as thing but if

1013
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,660
we're not doing that we're not

1014
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,009
protecting it all from the original

1015
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,140
problem that drove us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or</font>

1016
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:38,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just punting on it and at the</font>

1017
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:40,540
same time we made the situation worse or

1018
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:43,569
a whole bunch of applications than where

1019
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,160
it was six months ago and so I'm just

1020
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:49,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's a good privacy trade off</font>

1021
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:51,549
on that um and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't know</font>

1022
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,589
where we can go on them I think we we

1023
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,700
need to do it now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are solving the</font>

1024
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:58,180
problem that we thought we were solving

1025
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,529
up dislocation stuff then it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine</font>

1026
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,060
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see how if we don't mention</font>

1027
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,630
anything about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the prompt how we</font>

1028
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:07,538
possibly

1029
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:09,160
solving that Martin Thompson I think I

1030
00:51:07,539 --> 00:51:10,690
agree with what Alyssa sit on this one

1031
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,720
we should just rip out any any talk of

1032
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:16,480
what what it takes to get from two to

1033
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,819
three to four to one and let the

1034
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,119
browsers work that up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point I</font>

1035
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:24,009
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see anything I got though to</font>

1036
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,130
object to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that trust is</font>

1037
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:29,529
fungible the idea that you've given<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1038
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,990
someone you trust someone to access a

1039
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:35,380
particular microphone is it has no

1040
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:37,598
bearing whatsoever on whether you trust

1041
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,240
them with your location or anything else

1042
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:45,640
i think that's that's an important thing

1043
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:49,419
to get drummed into people's heads<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1044
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:51,519
and that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems like a hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font>

1045
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:54,009
into you know really fully support that

1046
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,769
like something that you invested saggy

1047
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:58,750
some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust into not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1048
00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:00,910
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases but sort of on the aggregate</font>

1049
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice probably be you know have a high</font>

1050
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:07,589
reputation than something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has not</font>

1051
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:10,630
been trusted oh oh please yeah I

1052
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:18,490
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really respond to that um but</font>

1053
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:20,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will know um the obvious the obvious</font>

1054
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:27,008
counter-argument there is something I'm

1055
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:28,930
not I shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say so that's all the</font>

1056
00:52:27,009 --> 00:52:31,299
example is seen that although contrived

1057
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:35,828
as they are sort of run caliber to that

1058
00:52:31,299 --> 00:52:37,299
if I if I think that I can control this

1059
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:39,009
permission that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given you to my</font>

1060
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:41,049
video camera that points at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall and</font>

1061
00:52:39,009 --> 00:52:42,279
never ever points at anything else or

1062
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:44,440
one that has a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tape over the top</font>

1063
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:47,259
of it that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different to teething</font>

1064
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,119
access to surprisingly something I'm

1065
00:52:47,259 --> 00:52:51,400
sure that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true that's a cherry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pick</font>

1066
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:53,980
case I mean in the aggregate form like I

1067
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,710
think that the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> basis of like this</font>

1068
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole about it I think we just disagree</font>

1069
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:04,069
on that one okay so i'm tired i'm sure

1070
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:06,259
you're tired and so

1071
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:10,519
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can close this on</font>

1072
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:12,890
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're all there Suzy</font>

1073
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:15,828
widespread agreement that the technical

1074
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:19,269
design proposal that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following</font>

1075
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:23,390
statements are okay namely that I

1076
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:26,419
browsers<font color="#E5E5E5"> um should it the president</font>

1077
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:28,009
would if they if they do short browser

1078
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:32,869
should be allowed to go in the mode one

1079
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:34,789
if they do this user consent for the

1080
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:36,680
camera microphone namely<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is user</font>

1081
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:37,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">interaction it may be the case the</font>

1082
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,499
browser should also be allowed to go

1083
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:44,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on without doing that or not</font>

1084
00:53:39,499 --> 00:53:47,390
um so I guess what what on the primary

1085
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:49,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">purpose as far as i can tell of on this</font>

1086
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:51,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">material here that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> debating is two</font>

1087
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,988
things one to say what browsers can and

1088
00:53:51,769 --> 00:53:55,669
cannot do<font color="#CCCCCC"> on if necessary the second is</font>

1089
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:58,400
to rationalize why we wait say they're

1090
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:00,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of do it on my senses the</font>

1091
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,319
people in the room with<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vok</font>

1092
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:05,329
saying essentially nothing here or

1093
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">either um giving browser digression do</font>

1094
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:11,239
they wanted or on or alternatively

1095
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,069
saying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browsers you know might</font>

1096
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:15,259
construe door might consider a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

1097
00:54:13,069 --> 00:54:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">action prior to giving access to mode</font>

1098
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:19,249
one on do you think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> assisting</font>

1099
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:22,430
stronger than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or do you just think</font>

1100
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:24,709
um I mean what is that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the UM</font>

1101
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:29,149
the normative forces what you're trying

1102
00:54:24,709 --> 00:54:31,069
to get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> here um or you just you</font>

1103
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,910
just think people wrong and so you want

1104
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:33,170
to argue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them which isn't</font>

1105
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:36,319
unreasonable at all since I do that all

1106
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,849
the time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right good man to some</font>

1107
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,440
extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the RFC</font>

1108
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:41,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">2119 discussion that we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have</font>

1109
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,039
later in this document of like what is

1110
00:54:41,059 --> 00:54:44,209
exactly this document you know which was

1111
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:45,949
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended as like a best</font>

1112
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,629
practices document and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being so</font>

1113
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,039
recast as a standards track document in

1114
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:52,039
which case this actually does have

1115
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,359
normative force um so like letting us

1116
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,650
assume for right now that is this inter

1117
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,288
strike and we all have a normative force

1118
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:01,519
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you this actually say you know</font>

1119
00:54:57,289 --> 00:55:03,979
I guess we have two options one we say

1120
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,749
like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that this in an algorithm</font>

1121
00:55:03,979 --> 00:55:07,609
sort of explained here like the consent

1122
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:09,680
that would be derived from like<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

1123
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:13,160
information should in fact we use as a

1124
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:16,230
hint to you know engage mode 1 702 we

1125
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:17,670
should say that no we make no

1126
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,290
explicit recommendation you might want

1127
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,880
to consider this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it's not</font>

1128
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,940
the browser's full discretion to decide

1129
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know with with whatever amount</font>

1130
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of texts we wanted to say we I wrestled</font>

1131
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,740
with this issue at length in like here's

1132
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,390
how we arrived at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conclusion or not</font>

1133
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,950
they're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two points as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

1134
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,200
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> our separate like I started</font>

1135
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:37,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing on the side of including the</font>

1136
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:39,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">rationale for posterity but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm</font>

1137
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:42,240
certainly open to like new precedent on

1138
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:44,609
the surface it sure yeah um face<font color="#E5E5E5"> ba I</font>

1139
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,740
would be honestly happy either we

1140
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">leaving browsers that discretion or not</font>

1141
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,979
the embrasure discretion on one thing

1142
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,260
maybe I'd suggest that might make people

1143
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,820
feel better about this would be that we

1144
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,260
talked earlier about how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1145
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,090
benefit of this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these are</font>

1146
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,640
consenting directly but that the user is

1147
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,869
has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the design loop as we in</font>

1148
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,540
there and production blooper doesn't

1149
00:56:00,869 --> 00:56:05,280
happen right right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so perhaps one</font>

1150
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,800
way to the difference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1151
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,080
happier would be not to talk about

1152
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:12,570
comparative levels of risk but to say

1153
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:15,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that browsers are required to encourage</font>

1154
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,950
or whatever to on builder interface in

1155
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:19,200
such a way that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible for</font>

1156
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">JavaScript to enter mode one without</font>

1157
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,720
some direct user interaction on with the

00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:28,109
browser on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other than simply</font>

1159
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:29,399
entering the system um as position

1160
00:56:28,109 --> 00:56:31,680
direction I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse than</font>

1161
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,180
typical the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> being that that would</font>

1162
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,830
mean any dialogue whatsoever was

1163
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,270
acceptable even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it said nothing it</font>

1164
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:38,340
was a quick he wrote you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you'd make</font>

1165
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:40,320
him out the coments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicker you all</font>

1166
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,270
right maybe that would satisfy people to

1167
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,400
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive by while avoiding this</font>

1168
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,100
order well i kind of consider

1169
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,130
hair-splitting about what the sort of

1170
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,170
bigger implications are of various

1171
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">hazards that right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got four</font>

1172
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:57,119
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got to clip the line at the</font>

1173
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:59,220
end of Martin so I would I mean that bc

1174
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems to make a recasting of this text</font>

1175
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,799
here um or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text i was on the slide</font>

1176
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:05,940
are we totally fine with that on but i'm

1177
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a good sense from the</font>

1178
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,440
room of whether people prefer that or

1179
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,419
they prefer basically you know running

1180
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">up hands and saying here's something you</font>

1181
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,190
might want to consider and you know

1182
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:19,020
basically putting out the stack to that

1183
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:22,680
be through city<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take what's</font>

1184
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,600
lot um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to retain some</font>

1185
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,509
ability to have browser discretion on

1186
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:30,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we may discover that there</font>

1187
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,500
are better ways to acquire

1188
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:37,500
signals necessary to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from two to</font>

1189
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:39,589
one and it may be that we decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font>

1190
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:43,500
do this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing I want to avoid</font>

1191
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:45,779
the prescription in the document as it

1192
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,210
stands and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid the</font>

1193
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:51,390
implications of that prescription which

1194
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:54,650
I think probably the most worrisome ok

1195
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:58,049
so these things oberoi with a proposal

1196
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,430
because I'm puzzle is fine the bars are

1197
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:03,930
should at least make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it has</font>

1198
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:05,549
some consent from it<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1199
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:07,558
maybe the details everything love to the

1200
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:09,839
review some some sort of weasel words

1201
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,390
around it so that we you know might

1202
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:14,279
decide that direct interaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

1203
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:15,900
point in time is not not an appropriate

1204
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,660
signal because we find some other

1205
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,069
signals but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that sounds great to me</font>

1206
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,420
so that there wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave them any</font>

1207
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:24,359
question of rationale do we include

1208
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,069
rationale or not in the document the

1209
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:30,140
point being<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should be</font>

1210
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:30,140
gating access to one as much as possible

1211
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:40,980
true we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually cut the line hurry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

1212
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">something really bad it looked two</font>

1213
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,859
minutes so get of evil words well

1214
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,240
actually expected that to be at the

1215
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:49,470
times when the most that thing spent the

1216
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,250
most time on so like that was actually

1217
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:56,790
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> due time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of</font>

1218
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:58,829
resolve any sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> terrifying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus</font>

1219
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:00,000
on this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are running out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1220
00:58:58,829 --> 00:59:02,460
effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> League will probably have to do</font>

1221
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on friday okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

1222
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,920
proxies then hopefully it's been less

1223
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:09,540
contentious Adam mentioned that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> force</font>

1224
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:14,450
proxy mode was previously called force

1225
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:17,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP and proxy for historical reasons</font>

1226
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:19,129
there could also be using proxies in in

1227
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,569
fact this document considers

1228
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically you know return proxies and</font>

1229
00:59:21,569 --> 00:59:28,259
how they might work that was absent<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1230
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:29,130
the initial version on basically these

1231
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,829
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of behaved a little bit</font>

1232
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:33,210
differently than TCP proxies in terms of

1233
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:34,530
how they interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the modes in</font>

1234
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the effect that they have</font>

1235
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:38,369
far fewer performance issues and

1236
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:40,319
therefore you know useful proxy is not

1237
00:59:38,369 --> 00:59:43,230
necessarily a big deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

1238
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,430
have a return proxy in place

1239
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:47,490
probably the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing is</font>

1240
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:49,770
that mode 3 provides most the benefits

1241
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:52,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would want on when you're using</font>

1242
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:54,270
a return proxy because the proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

1243
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,500
still be used for your trap you don't

1244
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:59,280
need to actually all the good oh wait go

1245
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mode for it actually force</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use of the</font>

proxy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show this in some</font>

1247
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:07,020
diagrams excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is how</font>

1248
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,000
imagine a network whether it's no sort

1249
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:12,420
of firewall blocking traffic to the

1250
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,030
outside and there is a you know HTTPS

1251
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,950
proxy available on the network in mode 2

1252
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,840
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the restricted gathering plus a</font>

1253
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:21,180
house candidate you'll still just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1254
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,490
the UDP path to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients because</font>

1255
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:27,419
that's by far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I visit the best path for</font>

1256
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:29,839
media traffic is similarly for mode 3

1257
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:31,859
except in the case where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1258
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,359
internal client you want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1259
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:34,590
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to end up actually hair</font>

1260
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,549
printing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eat the three</font>

1265
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:46,470
time the trap actually goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the proxy</font>

1266
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,649
is in mode for or where you actually say

1267
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:51,240
force the proxy on obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

1268
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,980
is different here if the application

firewall are sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the enterprise</font>

1270
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:56,880
firewall blocks direct UDP out then

1271
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,130
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> will off the funnel through</font>

1273
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:02,490
key thing is that for proxies that are

01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,729
firewall the only way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

1276
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,590
traffic finally for the proxy and

1277
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:14,190
following the same path as<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP traffic</font>

1278
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:16,170
is in mode for next slide so now we can

1279
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:20,820
consider the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the return proxy</font>

1280
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:22,980
behavior and just like in mode 2 you

1281
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,119
know you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct and this seems</font>

1282
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of thing you would want so</font>

1283
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:27,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can have direct connections</font>

1284
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:32,670
between clients they're both inside the

1285
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:34,560
same firewall but mode 3 we would want

1286
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:36,420
to use when you have the case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1287
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,810
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use give out the address</font>

1288
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:42,869
that really outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are already</font>

1289
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:46,220
seeing which is the intent of mode 3

1290
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:50,779
here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would actually want to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1291
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:53,629
return proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1292
01:01:50,779 --> 01:01:55,039
no internal candidates in mode 3 there's

1293
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,989
no local candidates being exchanged

1294
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:00,919
connections between local candidates

1295
01:01:56,989 --> 01:02:03,229
would in fact use the return proxy in a

1296
01:02:00,919 --> 01:02:04,249
foursome<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c case the traffic</font>

1297
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:07,339
will actually go through the return

1298
01:02:04,249 --> 01:02:08,658
proxy as well so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you compare</font>

1299
01:02:07,339 --> 01:02:11,029
between the slide in the previous slides

1300
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:12,469
will see that the restricted gathering

1301
01:02:11,029 --> 01:02:14,539
thing is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different in which</font>

1302
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:17,749
case the return proxy will actually be

1303
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:26,689
used for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know inside the</font>

1304
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:30,529
firewall case<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright next slide so</font>

1305
01:02:26,689 --> 01:02:33,288
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> along this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up the mailing</font>

1306
01:02:30,529 --> 01:02:37,489
list what do the words must and should

1307
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:39,859
mean in lower case which this document

1308
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:42,259
uses largely because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hadn't really</font>

1309
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:43,819
taken the time to consider exactly how I

best contracts as document should be

1311
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:47,390
written which spawned a very large

1312
01:02:45,799 --> 01:02:49,069
discussion across the IDF mailing list

1313
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:52,009
which came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I think the conclusion</font>

1314
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:55,009
that must in<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower case must actually do</font>

1315
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:57,650
mean different things which in some ways

01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:59,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">it with agonal to what is the ultimate</font>

the two questions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be considered here</font>

are is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard trac document or</font>

1320
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:08,569
not and if it's a standard stretch

1321
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:10,578
document shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be prescriptive by</font>

using<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 language about the</font>

recommendations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it makes on harrell</font>

01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:17,499
proposals that yes it should be

1325
01:03:15,439 --> 01:03:21,169
standards track similar to like the

1326
01:03:17,499 --> 01:03:23,118
audio and<font color="#E5E5E5"> video requirements and it</font>

1328
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:30,769
some examples on one particular example

1329
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was given was the the topic we've</font>

1330
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:35,118

made into<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 language so before before</font>

1333
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:42,619
we take the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to point out</font>

1334
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:44,269
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually is now running</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">over time so you're missing your</font>

1336
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:48,319
beverage break but I have a question for

1337
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:49,909
our illustrious area director so

1338
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,890
illustrious area director given that

1339
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">this could have been part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> j sep that</font>

1340
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:55,578
we not wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rev it</font>

1341
01:03:53,269 --> 01:04:00,250
independently are you okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1342
01:03:55,579 --> 01:04:02,440
being a standards track document yes

1343
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:04,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay is there anybody in the audience</font>

1344
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:08,110
who wishes to go against the word of our

1345
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:10,480
illustrious area director and our former

1346
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:16,330
IETF chair that this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate</font>

1347
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:18,490
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> trac document okay nobody left</font>

1348
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:21,250
to the microphone who hadn't already

1349
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:23,319
left the room sure I may have cast that

1350
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:26,890
slightly badly but we'll ask on a

1351
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:31,900
mailing list again given the previous

1352
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:33,460
discussion on consent and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

1353
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,310
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not read too much into these</font>

1354
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:38,200
particular examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that the</font>

1355
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:41,680
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for us to do is to ask the</font>

1356
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:43,270
author<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take into account the obvious</font>

1357
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,100
consensus to move this to standards

1358
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:46,960
track and more prescriptive language as

1359
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:49,060
a result and to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with language</font>

1360
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,640
for us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider in a pull request on</font>

1361
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,320
on friday<font color="#CCCCCC"> or on the mailing list is</font>

1362
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,640
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with that yeah yeah and i</font>

1363
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,320
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to point a point out Justin I</font>

1364
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:58,060
mean even even if we never were

1365
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:59,590
prescriptive about which mode to use win

1366
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,140
and we just defined what the modes were

1367
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:03,490
and some other document specified those

1368
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'd still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be perfectly reasonable</font>

1369
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:09,399
abstract thought so sure that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1370
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:15,960
independent decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think that's</font>

1371
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it next there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a nice oh yeah so sorry</font>

1372
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:22,000
definitely they'll be publishing a new

1373
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:24,220
version at some point so we will talk to

1374
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,830
Justin offline about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

1375
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:29,410
hope for a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull request on this</font>

1376
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:30,880
most recent slide before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>
