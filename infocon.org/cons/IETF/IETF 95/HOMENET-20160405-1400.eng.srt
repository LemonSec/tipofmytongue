editor and the authors etc we're seeing

78
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:05,720
a progression happening I imagine this

79
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,770
will come to the club come to close very

working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> director terry on</font>

84
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,460
exactly what we were going to state from

85
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:30,919
the working group and from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s in</font>

86
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:34,880
terms of what to do about a mandatory to

87
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,799
experiment with routing protocol we

88
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,838
<font color="#E5E5E5">emailed the list with some carefully</font>

89
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,000
worded text along those lines we

90
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,979
discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the last meeting Terry</font>

had indicated that he would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

92
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,750
that published as an RFC in some form

93
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,069
when we were talking about it at the

94
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:55,910
time but then later he said no actually

95
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:58,010
it's fine the email stands as a good

96
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,779
enough record you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the internet</font>

97
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,360
draft out there let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just leave</font>

98
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:04,459
it at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were fine but we</font>

99
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,610
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to update the document the</font>

100
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:09,349
internet draft to say that okay to say

101
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,170
that oh by the way this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sitting</font>

102
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,110
here expired because nobody cares it's

103
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we explicitly decided to just</font>

104
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,860
not advance it anymore because the the

105
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,199
email to the list and the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the meeting last time was sufficient in</font>

his mom

108
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:31,470
so that's why that's there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font>

fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> with everybody here then and on the</font>

111
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,709
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the dash 0 1 we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

112
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,620
new drafts one of which Ted will be

113
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,790
talking about later today and Julius

114
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,720
will be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about basically the two</font>

115
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,849
new drafts are what you're going to hear

116
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the agenda today Jeff's hold</font>

117
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting other documents ah we've got</font>

118
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,319
some stuff that's stuck because it

119
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,350
references<font color="#E5E5E5"> other working groups in</font>

120
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,320
particular hybrid proxy stuff and things

121
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,480
related to the naming architecture that

122
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,900
clearly ray wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say something about</font>

123
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,150
yeah the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two drafts from dinamico &</font>

124
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Co on the front head naming delegation</font>

125
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,350
and naming architecture one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those has</font>

126
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,720
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> just recently expired but</font>

127
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:20,220
position we're taking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

128
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,190
don't see any point in advancing those

129
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wiles the overall picture of the whole</font>

130
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:29,040
net naming so a discovery architecture

131
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,960
is being rationalizing that there's no

132
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,520
point writing something up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

133
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,650
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we actually decide as</font>

134
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,300
a working group that it doesn't fit and

135
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,600
is not consistent with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overall</font>

136
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:48,780
architecture so that's the opposition on

137
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:49,860
those so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on the</font>

138
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:57,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group update did we miss</font>

139
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:59,250
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so without further ado</font>

140
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,780
and slightly ahead of schedule let's

141
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:09,360
have do list please up to talk about the

142
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:11,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">babel profile for home that and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

143
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,560
think speaks no drill but please do stay

144
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:18,209
within the pink square so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the road</font>

145
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,130
participants can see you best so hello

146
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm julia scrubber checks next slide</font>

147
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:27,510
please next slide please yeah so there

148
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,819
are two issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to solve</font>

149
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,810
with the draft when<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

150
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">flexible protocol and that different</font>

151
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,609
implementations interoperate but to the

152
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,709
extent possible we then do the

153
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain that in a second</font>

154
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,729
and the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,430
some interactions between<font color="#E5E5E5"> H</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> n CP and</font>

156
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,519
label and those interactions have to be

157
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:52,800
gotten just right so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

158
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:55,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you about cook is already written down</font>

159
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,839
in a draft which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babel profile</font>

160
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,970
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> home net and I said what I think</font>

161
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,380
should be added to this draft which is

162
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,399
the descriptions of the interaction

163
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:09,380
between H<font color="#CCCCCC"> n CP and able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X like these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

164
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,790
so Babel is a flexible protocol and

165
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,579
implementations can implement very

166
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,300
different things so they will

167
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:20,160
interoperate but one needs to understand

168
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,800
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs so to give you</font>

169
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,319
an example it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite legal for a table</font>

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,740
implementation to only<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement ipv6</font>

171
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,829
and not ipv4 so if you have one

172
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,899
implementation a that supports ipv6 and

173
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:36,930
ipv4 and the second implementation that

174
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,730
only does ipv6 they will interoperate in

175
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,560
the sense that they will exchange ipv6

176
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">routes but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously they will not</font>

177
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:50,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange I key forwards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's slide and</font>

178
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:53,370
the bagel RFC the current experimental

179
00:12:50,699 --> 00:12:55,260
Eric C does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fix the values of</font>

180
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,810
metrics so it could very well come up

181
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,990
with an implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> X that gives a</font>

182
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,000
metric of 96 to aillard links which is

183
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,529
the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all implementations I think</font>

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists now and the second</font>

185
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:09,000
implementation that assigns a metric of

186
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,070
one so those two implementation will

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,170
interoperate but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you will get</font>

188
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,570
suboptimal routing as the links handled

189
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,000
by implementation y will be preferred to

190
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:24,420
those handle the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> X that's</font>

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:27,149
like so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have written down is a</font>

192
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,610
short document that describes the subset

193
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,940
of the protocol that a helmet implement

194
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:35,250
eructation must implement as well as

195
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,870
suggested values that the helmet

196
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:40,079
implement must assigned to the

197
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,329
parameters it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven requirements so</font>

198
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,899
i used the numbered<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements style</font>

199
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:48,000
with rationale after each five which I

200
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,920
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be non controversial and</font>

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,390
people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already laughing in the</font>

202
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,430
audience when I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> non controversial</font>

203
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,770
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think has been somewhat</font>

204
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,079
contentious and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that I don't</font>

205
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:02,020
understand sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've written it but I</font>

206
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">need clarification because I I'll come</font>

207
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:08,650
back to that next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please so I'm</font>

208
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to go through the five less</font>

209
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,189
interesting requirements please don't

210
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,800
take my works or that check them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:17,140
draft but the one that proved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

212
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,599
controversial is requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font>

213
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:25,990
says that ipv4 support is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sugar and</font>

214
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,870
one person expressed the notion that it

215
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,030
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a must my take on that is that</font>

216
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,210
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> finalists should I'm fine with must</font>

217
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:38,439
because people will implement ipv4 for

218
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,270
as long as the market needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I'm</font>

219
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,010
fine was changing that to master people

220
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:46,300
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide</font>

221
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">please so I've cooked in a requirement</font>

222
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">site which I don't understand it says</font>

223
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:59,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a helmet implementation of Babel</font>

224
00:14:51,790 --> 00:15:00,430
must implement in we have plenty of time

225
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:02,709
so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should take these one at a</font>

226
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:06,030
time can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say yeah we're whizzing</font>

227
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:09,370
through here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a comment on</font>

228
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:12,430
Java from Marcus he says must is not

229
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:15,010
really in hnc p knowing the charter or

230
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:19,030
the architecture draft so he thinks

231
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:21,550
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's fine and for ipv4 right yeah</font>

232
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with my java hat off i</font>

233
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:31,630
would agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay should we make a</font>

234
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,340
cobbler so requirements five so what

235
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:38,020
feedback did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just get where where</font>

236
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,510
are we i I'm hearing from lee and i'm

237
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,920
hearing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> marcus that should is fine</font>

238
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,970
for that but your slide said you would

239
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,229
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to must wait hang on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should oh</font>

240
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,120
that's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it says should and must</font>

241
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,000
on the same sentence should this be a

242
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,010
must I think consistent with this

243
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,140
charter in the working group it should

244
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,670
not be a most it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued does</font>

245
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:03,430
everybody agree Lee Howard it may be a

246
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:06,130
may yeah okay it must be assured yes

247
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,609
actually it may be what it may be a may

248
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,560
know I

249
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,200
would actually be fine with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll live</font>

250
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,689
with should<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it must be issued I</font>

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,540
must at least be<font color="#E5E5E5"> assured can't be must</font>

252
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay not require I people to be just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

253
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,149
step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the technical jargon we</font>

254
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,500
can't require ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> per our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter and /</font>

255
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,839
what's you know was really going to have

256
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,140
with implementations I think so yes I'm

257
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:34,990
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this as written as written</font>

258
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so it's a should great moving right</font>

259
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:43,540
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so uh huh as always there is</font>

260
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,579
this year security so cuz i couldnt in

261
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,579
requirement five is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a helmet</font>

262
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:51,010
implementation of Babel must implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> h</font>

263
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:54,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">mag based authentication is defined in</font>

264
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,319
RFC seven to nine eight must implement

265
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:59,079
the two men retreat<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement</font>

266
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,510
algorithm's and must enable and require

267
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:05,290
authentication when instructed to do so

268
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,510
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NCP so I have no idea whether this</font>

269
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:09,639
does reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opinion of the working</font>

270
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:11,619
group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

271
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,400
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work since I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

272
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:18,369
H NCP is supposed to sharkeez with Babel

273
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,490
so I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge opportunity a</font>

274
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,649
chance ET can serve as a you know

275
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:27,699
managed security in the hell<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell net</font>

276
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,230
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know how to do that I might</font>

277
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,080
speak to that a little bit after my

278
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:35,410
presentation on<font color="#CCCCCC"> names tis Ted lemon um</font>

279
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,629
but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the musts are necessary</font>

280
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,669
because otherwise you'll have

281
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,040
implementations that don't have that

282
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:44,860
feature so whether or not we're able to

283
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,149
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on we need or whether or not we</font>

284
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,620
turn it on all the time we need to be

285
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:55,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on and that's what that</font>

286
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:58,870
must says and so Marcus<font color="#CCCCCC"> stenberg again</font>

287
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,580
on jabber requirement 5h NCP generates

288
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,979
keying material which can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

289
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,710
derive her other protocol key material

290
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,660
pre-show key implies instructors

291
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:14,549
straightforward but i'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

292
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,549
must acquit must

293
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,039
Michael Abramson so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this makes</font>

294
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,379
the perfect perfect sense because I

295
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:26,510
expect a chance if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn Babel on and</font>

296
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,270
off on certain interfaces like the when

297
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,309
you defy when HSP decides that this is

298
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,100
an external<font color="#E5E5E5"> facing interface I would</font>

299
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,620
expect it to tell Babel do not talk on

300
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,689
this interface so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already</font>

301
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,239
have that agency p must be able to

302
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,429
provision or instructive able to do

303
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and this seems like a perfectly</font>

304
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:53,690
fine thing for a chance' p to instruct

305
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:57,469
able to do i think i might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be Marcus</font>

306
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:59,779
quite a bit yeah Marcus says must

307
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:02,360
implement perhaps although i think all

308
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,090
must see<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> employed just that a it</font>

309
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:10,070
must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented and be enabled if</font>

310
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:12,529
and only if<font color="#E5E5E5"> h NCP tells it to so he</font>

311
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:23,270
thinks the text is fine what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he says on</font>

312
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:28,580
chapman any objections with the text as

313
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:32,629
is and of course instruct would be some

314
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,460
sort of internal IP do internal process

315
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,700
communication or however it works on

316
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:40,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">your product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between the HNC peat layer</font>

317
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,250
and the routing protocol layer are we

318
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:46,100
fine with that it did Michael Lorenzen

319
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,409
again I would be fine with provisioned

320
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,360
or some other wording as well but that's

321
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:56,419
basically the same thing as saying you

322
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:58,279
instructed it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Lee how</font>

323
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,659
we're just making a note that I that do

324
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,970
think we need to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how that's</font>

325
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:03,440
done right I'm not I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

326
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,450
there yet but I think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

327
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,130
thing to assign ourselves to figure out

328
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:13,010
yes Michael Abramson<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't that be</font>

329
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,659
implementation-specific oh this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

330
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:19,370
interaction between agency p how would

331
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:22,399
exactly this is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

332
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:25,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">think but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't that seems like an</font>

333
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:27,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation detail but well I would</font>

334
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:28,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the way would need something some</font>

335
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,680
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think it's specified an</font>

336
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,480
agency p

337
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,250
now but somebody who knows more than I

338
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,340
do can correct me that we would need a

339
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,320
common way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> H NCP to signal that it</font>

340
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,169
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that it should be done and</font>

341
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,790
then the Babel implementation can<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

342
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it's going to implement how to</font>

343
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:49,270
interpret that instruction may I answer

344
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,100
this perhaps before so the two

345
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,700
implementations of agency p do things

346
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,550
differently so<font color="#E5E5E5"> marcus's and stevens</font>

347
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,590
implementation when there is a change

348
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:01,780
restarts Babel which called me to do

349
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:07,149
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work on rebooting in a</font>

350
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:09,160
graceful manner shmc p right now doesn't

351
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Babel at all except through the</font>

352
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:14,920
colonel and we have recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented</font>

353
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">a communication on the Babel side not on</font>

354
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> h and CP side yet over a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX the</font>

355
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,909
main socket so I wouldn't like to

356
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,590
mandate how this is done because we have

357
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:25,690
different implementations and we want to

358
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,129
keep the liberty of implementing them in

359
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,050
different manners yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

360
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:32,350
system integration issue that we should

361
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,310
not standardized<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I was</font>

362
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,969
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it needs to be</font>

363
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,919
standardized in agency p how do how does

364
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,620
agency p communicate to whatever Babel

365
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,660
implementation I think what it

366
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:48,879
communicates it should be standardized

367
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,230
but not how it's done or yes sir marcus

368
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,590
seems to agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what he say on</font>

369
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,180
jabber but I'll relay it so he doesn't

370
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,550
object the text as is he's fine with

371
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,410
that hnc p just defines the shaky

372
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:01,570
generation and that would either be

373
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:03,970
stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a configuration file or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> towed</font>

374
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,770
by IPC for example bird demon

375
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,870
implementation might support that one

376
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,900
day but<font color="#CCCCCC"> he says that's just an</font>

377
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,340
implementation detail and then response

378
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,830
the other comment he says agency p

379
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,540
specifies it already just<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

380
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,210
implementation details on how the

381
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,389
process process is darkness as you were

382
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,540
just saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need a tow package</font>

383
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:29,230
skip those comments now by the way so he

384
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:33,280
agrees with Michael okay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will take</font>

385
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:36,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list well as and when that's</font>

386
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,110
well I'll look then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue on</font>

387
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,790
talk about next<font color="#CCCCCC"> steps well Lee just</font>

388
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:48,429
agreed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jabber</font>

389
00:22:42,790 --> 00:23:00,460
with Marcus so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we concluded did</font>

390
00:22:48,430 --> 00:23:04,740
its IPC and outside of scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh so</font>

391
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,800
okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the well I was writing that I</font>

392
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:12,070
started you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know grabbing for the HNC p</font>

393
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,050
specification and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i realized that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

394
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:17,200
is something that is nowhere written

395
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,649
down which seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us reasonably</font>

396
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,440
obvious which is that a chance EP uses

397
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:27,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">babel to announce roots and you need to</font>

398
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,750
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the precise rules right so if you</font>

399
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,060
have received a dhcpv6 prefix delegation

400
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,670
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce a source specific default</font>

401
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,970
route on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you receive a</font>

402
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:43,990
dhcp v for lease then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce a</font>

403
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonspecific default route and so there</font>

404
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,610
is an asymmetry here between ipv6 and

405
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,040
ipv4 and there are very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

406
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,320
reasons for this asymmetry however if

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,060
you get it wrong you are going to get

408
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,689
suboptimal routing and you might even

409
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,520
have root in black holes so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

410
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,840
needs to be written down there is a

411
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,750
third requirement that the third

412
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,030
requirement is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as sensitive as</font>

413
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,270
pretty obvious so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this needs to</font>

414
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,430
be written down somewhere and I think

415
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:18,970
that this document would be a fine place

416
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:21,340
to put it so Michael Lorenzen again I

417
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine that this is written</font>

418
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">down but in the last thing here I</font>

419
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,110
thought they were picked up prefixes

420
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,990
from the colonel so each and CP

421
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured interface address and then</font>

422
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:37,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">people picked it up from the earth from</font>

423
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:40,510
the from the interface so that's an

424
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:44,020
implementation detail how<font color="#CCCCCC"> hnc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> causes</font>

425
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">stable to announce the prefix is the</font>

426
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:50,350
internal business and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> H net D and</font>

427
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">SH NCP do it differently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in the</font>

428
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,730
third bullet point here is it eat

429
00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:02,520
analysis

430
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:04,470
so agency p announces a route the orgo

431
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing miss understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font>

432
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,570
have used it so here I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose this</font>

433
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,910
is stuff that does not written down yet

434
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can belong in a draft I</font>

435
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,179
need to check<font color="#CCCCCC"> very carefully both</font>

436
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:19,350
implementations to check whether they

437
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,840
comply and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they don't why so here the</font>

438
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:23,580
point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm taking is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hn CP</font>

439
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,610
is using be able to announce the roots

440
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,710
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it as Babel as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font>

441
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,530
NCP causes Babel to announce the roots

442
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:35,730
that's fine too yes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for me</font>

443
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,559
the second the first word on the second

444
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,960
line of the first bullet point is

445
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,629
confusing I don't know what it announces

446
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:48,270
what it in this case is because HSP

447
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:51,140
doesn't announce roads for the no Marcus

448
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:55,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stanwyck of our children</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hnc be node is</font>

449
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:59,160
essentially the whole Rueter he thanks

450
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,610
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> HNH net D has nothing to do</font>

451
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,890
with dhcpv6 or dhcp sourced roots and

452
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,469
instead Babel propagates them directly

453
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,300
from Colonel<font color="#CCCCCC"> fed brackets Linux has no</font>

454
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:17,400
real rib except in particular routine

455
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:19,470
demons devil hunter so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

456
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,420
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is slightly over specified</font>

457
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,940
especially the first to Clause because

458
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,460
there may be some other way that the

459
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,740
node gets internet connectivity and it's

460
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,260
not the HTTP so it just needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

461
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit less specific I think I so</font>

462
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,410
the thing that the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

463
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:40,920
important here is that in the v6 case

464
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:43,020
like that in the v6 case it is a source

465
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pacific default route well in the v4</font>

466
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,830
case it's a non specific route that is

467
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,100
the part that has to be gotten right

468
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:53,610
right but it's it might not be dhcpv6

469
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,469
for example sorry David I clarify so you

470
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:59,010
said it may be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright for example I</font>

471
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">said yes for example or manual</font>

472
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:06,419
configuration I fully agree what's the

473
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:08,340
real problem with you might you might be

474
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:13,200
tempted to announce a

475
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:16,889
so specific dhcpd for IPC no root in

476
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,330
which case if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have sorry I mean</font>

477
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,610
you're just repeating yourself so why

478
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,168
aren't they separate to the point that

479
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,729
we don't care or are you saying that

480
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a dual stack application</font>

481
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,230
somewhere that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might put some traffic</font>

482
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:30,450
over before some traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> / v 60 and its</font>

483
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,570
disparate<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes they would care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no what</font>

484
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,460
I'm saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if some nodes</font>

485
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:38,789
distribute is so specific and others a

486
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,580
nonspecific default route you will have

487
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:45,629
root and failures speak about dhcp about

488
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:48,750
ipv4 only so in ipv4 if you have some

489
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:51,330
nodes that announced a specific route

490
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,549
others a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non specific route you're going</font>

491
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:57,120
to have issues so everyone has to agree

492
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:58,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 is nonspecific or yes or the</font>

493
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,529
opposite<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy I already had that in my</font>

494
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:05,699
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but okay that's that's I gotta it</font>

495
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:07,950
Michael Lorenzen iya so i have to do

496
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,649
agree with the daily here that it should

497
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">be day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pv6 or other mechanism but i</font>

498
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,629
think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already you're now i cannot</font>

499
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:18,270
hear you so when it receives a dhcpv6

500
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,330
prefix it should be somehow gets of

501
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:23,070
prefix the vendor configured fight by

502
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,168
some mechanism so but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think you</font>

503
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">already agreed with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> david on that</font>

504
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:33,029
portrait and to be clear this seems like

505
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:38,549
a general<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual-stack source-specific</font>

506
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:40,950
routing issue um we may come up with a

507
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:44,580
solution such as assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonspecific</font>

508
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:46,919
default route with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ihome net but it's</font>

509
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,980
a general issue I wonder if we it needs

510
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:59,610
to be stated in some source desk routing

511
00:28:49,980 --> 00:29:00,570
document in its general form ok will

512
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,350
make a note of that in the minutes

513
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:10,139
whoever's taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> them please thank you</font>

514
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:13,559
Tim please<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what I'm suggesting</font>

515
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,950
here is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it's in a single</font>

516
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,629
two-part document that describes the

517
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,539
Babel profile for<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole net or have</font>

518
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,080
based on the current draft and a second

519
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:24,360
part that is

520
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,860
the interactions between H<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Abel</font>

521
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,260
something that is not written yet the

522
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,570
only written down<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is slide 8 of</font>

523
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,129
this presentation and I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

524
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,110
suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this this should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

525
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:39,929
working group document thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

526
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:41,610
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Thank You Julius and we</font>

527
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,149
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more common trick so let's go</font>

528
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,639
ahead with<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch yeah Mike Eruzione and</font>

529
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:51,209
so you said only that it should specify

530
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,549
the the metric in along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lines of</font>

531
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,679
what was written there dude don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

532
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to specify that a bit more or do</font>

533
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,289
you want to specify that in Babel being

534
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:04,950
the potential new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group so one</font>

535
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:07,110
of the requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

536
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,460
haven't put in this presentation one of

537
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,789
the five requirements speaks about

538
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,880
metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm ok and what it says is there</font>

539
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:21,149
is a must and eschewed the must says

540
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:24,240
that the metrics must be no less than 96

541
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:27,418
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> why or no less than 256 for wireless</font>

542
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,429
links the shooter says you should be

543
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:31,679
using an algorithm on wireless on

544
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:34,320
wireless links that determines link

545
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,710
quality mm-hmm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you want to</font>

546
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,470
tighten this formulation that's a

547
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:44,389
reasonable thing to do yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

548
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:47,700
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring it bring it up here is</font>

549
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:49,320
when we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a veil profile it</font>

550
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,230
sounds like that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be beneficial if</font>

551
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,029
table implementations behaved you know

552
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,460
similar in this aspect when it comes to

553
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:58,139
setting the metric and not just it

554
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,090
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same in order of</font>

555
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:01,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">magnitude but it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be or you know</font>

556
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:04,559
it should be closer it should be more

557
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,960
specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> somehow of it and this could</font>

558
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,158
be a later work I don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

559
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that should be more specific first we</font>

560
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,919
are speaking about how networks here

561
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:18,750
which I accept to have expect to have

562
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,120
reasonable reasonable amount of

563
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:23,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">diversity you're not expecting to have</font>

564
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten different paths between two routers</font>

565
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:29,699
so if the values of the metrics are not

566
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,490
exactly so if one router has one and 196

567
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,370
you run into trouble but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only uses 96</font>

568
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,010
and another 104 you're still going to

569
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,169
get pretty

570
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,580
optimal route at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I don't</font>

571
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,710
want to prevent people from

572
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:44,409
experimenting with vetterling quality

573
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,840
estimators so I wouldn't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as we</font>

574
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed it yesterday there is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

575
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,290
work to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on link quality</font>

576
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,350
estimators and they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely not</font>

577
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,149
want us right now to say you must use

578
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,070
this link quality estimator don't

579
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,590
experiment with anything you then a

580
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,919
fully agree with that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there just I</font>

581
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:04,419
know we should put in some note on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

582
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,630
that this is being done somewhere else

583
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:12,100
or future work<font color="#CCCCCC"> persons like that that</font>

584
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so memory darlin harder so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

585
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to voice agreement as in i</font>

586
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:19,090
personally think that it's very

587
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have for home knit for the</font>

588
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,620
application space of Home net document

589
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,450
describing what the metrics are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

590
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,639
algorithm you're using I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

591
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,560
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> in scope for home net and not</font>

592
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,140
for the Babel<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working group because</font>

593
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,240
this is application<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific to the home</font>

594
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,130
that domain and those metrics that we

595
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,500
are writing down here are four home net

596
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,360
and some admin using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Babel in the</font>

00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,760
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> network or network of whatever</font>

598
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,110
they may have completely different

599
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:50,500
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need so I think we</font>

600
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:53,199
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this here okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so from</font>

601
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,900
the chair what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably do is issue</font>

602
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,460
a working group called for adoption to

603
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list just to get the</font>

604
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:02,200
formalities out of the way I can't see

605
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,160
had personally reason why this won't be

606
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,170
adopted I will respect to the

607
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,030
interactions between nature and CP and

608
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,550
Babel<font color="#CCCCCC"> tziporah question for Judas is</font>

609
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,389
just going to sat down do you feel

610
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,740
jealous that you could do with

611
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:19,030
additional contributors to such a

612
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:20,950
document sorry do you feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

613
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,870
could benefit from having additional

614
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:26,200
contributors to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document to address</font>

615
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:27,610
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and presumably the ocean and</font>

616
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:31,750
CP experts would probably be a useful

617
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:35,110
pool for that so yes so um unfortunately

618
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:37,720
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and CP folks aren't here what for</font>

619
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:40,270
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor of any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are here but</font>

620
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah we would encourage them to work</font>

621
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:45,280
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Julius</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and best guess do as Julius</font>

622
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,310
proposed and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all addressed in</font>

623
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,750
that document that said if we have any

624
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:55,990
aspiring agent

625
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:58,600
CP experts don't be shy we could use use

626
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:04,120
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that aren't here</font>

627
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:06,790
today okay if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing further on</font>

628
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:23,589
the Babel side cool Ted up talk about

<font color="#E5E5E5">the naming architecture draft link hi</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> stand closer to it how's that okay</font>

633
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,009
uh next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide assume everybody knows</font>

634
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,810
what what I'm gonna be talking about how

635
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:50,860
many people have read the president this

636
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:56,350
the document by the way thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

637
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:58,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that okay so obviously one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

638
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:59,560
goals of this is to clarify for people

639
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,090
who read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document which is not</font>

640
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,610
actually all that many folks sitting

641
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:09,280
here stuff that they might have

642
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:10,840
questions about and then I does<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

643
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,330
like to just give everybody else in the

644
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,100
room sort of a taste of what the

645
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:18,790
document talks about so that they'll get

646
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,200
excited and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

647
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,230
tomato throwing section I'd like people

648
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,640
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things that they think the</font>

649
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,610
document tries to do that maybe you're

650
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">not a good idea and also to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out</font>

651
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:33,490
anything that they might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

652
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:35,080
missing from the document next slide so

653
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,879
I forgot to document the multiple name

654
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,370
space case that's the case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

655
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,500
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more than one sub</font>

656
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,270
domain and you're in your home net the

657
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,860
whole net document currently just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

658
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:50,380
about a single forward domain but that

659
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,660
was just a an oversight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll add</font>

660
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,330
that in and a new version I forgot to

661
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,100
add the remote device registration cases

662
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:58,480
the case where you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> device that</font>

663
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,000
you're using in the home that you'd like

664
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be reachable in the home that even</font>

665
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,890
when you're not

666
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,390
actually there for example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

667
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,799
have a phone that has something<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

668
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,098
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want some device in your home</font>

669
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:11,359
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get to reach out to and it</font>

670
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,279
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if there a way to register</font>

671
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:21,078
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that will be added</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a future</font>

672
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:22,400
version of the document the one of the

673
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,980
things about in the home that

674
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,359
architecture is a requirement for being

675
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:31,059
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rename devices give a device</font>

676
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,808
that's got a name in the home net

677
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:36,980
namespace a different name and

678
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,809
implicitly that's without actually

679
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,970
telling the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

680
00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:43,400
different name and making the device

681
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,839
register that different name that's

682
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,270
problematic I don't think it's possible

683
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:52,308
with mdns there's a an idea for how to

684
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,660
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns updates work in the document</font>

685
00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:55,160
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done with that</font>

686
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,299
so it's possible that we could specify

687
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:02,598
that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably how I would</font>

688
00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:04,220
address that and then otherwise I went

689
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,170
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home that architecture</font>

690
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,490
requirements again this morning just to

691
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:10,190
check and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty sure that i hit</font>

692
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,598
everything so I think it's complete if

693
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,400
you don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's complete please</font>

694
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:19,130
tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tim is going to tell me</font>

695
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:20,990
that it's not complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> tin shine is this</font>

696
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I was set up told I was overdriving</font>

697
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,709
the mic before can you hear me like this

698
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:28,279
I can hear you so I've got a hearing

699
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:30,410
problem cycle yeah so what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

700
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:32,660
there was the Christians<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking came up</font>

701
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:35,210
in DNS SD so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to think in</font>

702
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,788
this about obfuscating names from the

703
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,789
privacy point of view as well yeah so

704
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:47,930
hit that in somehow right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a that</font>

705
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:49,339
as an interesting point um yeah the

706
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,680
problem with do I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

707
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:52,819
worth it's probably what I should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

708
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,169
just say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font>

709
00:37:52,819 --> 00:37:55,640
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done in its future work</font>

710
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,359
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly don't know how to do</font>

711
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,210
it and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we tried to hold</font>

712
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,339
off on completing this document until I

713
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,529
know how to do it but by all means if

714
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:09,259
you have a suggestion send text so I

715
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:11,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks yeah I think that will get</font>

00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,190
teased a<font color="#E5E5E5"> in discussion of Christians</font>

718
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,690
to the home analyst<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe bearing in my</font>

722
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,860
fact church and the other thing of

723
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,870
course is the discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hybrid</font>

724
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,180
proxy approach against the DNS update

725
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:30,490
approach where I think in DNS SD we

726
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,319
agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take that to a separate maybe</font>

727
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:35,020
short document to discuss it's not going

728
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,090
to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> short document but ya know a</font>

729
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,190
separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we just simply can't do</font>

730
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:41,260
it the exact same way that mdns SD

731
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:45,130
hybrid does it and have it work in the

732
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:46,810
home net which is fine but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font>

733
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:48,730
think we can do it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

734
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:54,549
a later slide by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way so we could get</font>

735
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:55,930
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then what we can do is come up</font>

736
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a way to do it that's it's</font>

737
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:01,779
compatible with what<font color="#CCCCCC"> mdn SSD hybrid does</font>

738
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:03,070
and that's what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do but it's</font>

739
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:07,930
not going to be the same exact thing

740
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:10,810
Dave did you want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something um</font>

741
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:13,750
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Andrew Sullivan on Java</font>

742
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,920
has said perhaps we should for number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

743
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,390
people haven't read the document should

744
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,740
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea to get the overview out</font>

745
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,500
of the way before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start talking about</font>

746
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,779
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are missing right yeah</font>

747
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,160
actually I didn't intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of</font>

748
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,900
this slide was to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what you</font>

749
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,640
didn't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me about not to get</font>

750
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to tell me what was missing so I</font>

751
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,850
should have articulated that better

752
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,190
that's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> andrew sync</font>

753
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,540
with that side yet but I'm sorry I think

754
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,730
andrew is saying put that slide at the

755
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,529
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation but sure this is</font>

756
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,810
dave taylor can actually ask a question

757
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,190
on the slide then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may ok I</font>

758
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,930
understand everything in the slide which

759
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,340
had lost me on the third bullet so I

760
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,440
didn't follow what the third bullet was

761
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,380
what the relationship was to the naming

762
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,450
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the idea is that</font>

763
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,560
imagine that Europe I've read parts of

764
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,419
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft or not all of them and I</font>

765
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,509
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any place in it let's</font>

766
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:01,450
think of a home net as as like analogous

767
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:05,260
to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are I might have done</font>

768
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:08,290
at our respective corporations in 1990

769
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,380
when we were operating as own for a zone

770
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:14,040
file right it's got a bunch of names in

771
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,690
it those names correspond to hosts and

772
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,990
it's just very natural to go in and want

773
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you know change a name like you know</font>

774
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">put in so so the name like you know if</font>

775
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you would if you've got a</font>

776
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,740
workstation that belongs to person a and

777
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,348
you want to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to person B you</font>

778
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,538
might change its name so

779
00:40:28,349 --> 00:40:32,720
by changing the name of the workstation

780
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,739
not by changing a name in a database

781
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,660
that's why that's why I'm confused<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

782
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree that that is the correct way to</font>

783
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:41,930
solve the problem the question is

784
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:45,390
whether it's possible because remember

785
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:47,249
we're getting the names of so so in the

786
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,538
example that I talked about to call time

787
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:49,439
and say you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend time in here</font>

788
00:40:48,539 --> 00:40:50,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all I'm argues I don't</font>

789
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,660
understand why that's actually part of

790
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion here so if you're saying</font>

791
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,239
let's not discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now that's actually</font>

792
00:40:53,009 --> 00:40:58,799
fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer so yeah I mean personally I</font>

793
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:01,920
think that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that this isn't</font>

794
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:04,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually yeah it'd be nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

795
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,849
do this but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a core piece of</font>

796
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,509
functionality so yeah let's go let's go

797
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next slide sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

798
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:17,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough so aspects of the architecture so</font>

799
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:21,419
first of all just on a very high level

800
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:24,299
there are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document is currently</font>

801
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,670
written describes two databases of names

802
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:28,109
one of those names<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of names</font>

803
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,519
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might think of as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

804
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:34,859
zone so you know host names but also

805
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:38,160
services so service discovery might be

806
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:41,788
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that zone and then there's a</font>

807
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,379
reverse zone and this is you know sort

808
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:48,329
of in a turn on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> pipe e6 DARPA used</font>

809
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,829
and there's been some discussion about

810
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:53,430
whether the reverse zone is actually

811
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:54,690
useful and my main reason for wanting it

812
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:58,140
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient place</font>

813
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,759
to put things about an IP address that

814
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,098
might be local like a key that you could

815
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:03,989
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it</font>

816
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:05,729
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth worth having and that's why</font>

817
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:09,210
it's in there but that's a point that

818
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:13,189
can be discussed currently it does not

819
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:16,950
support the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> for naming a</font>

820
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:19,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">human-readable sub domain as is</font>

821
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:22,109
described in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns SD hybrid document</font>

822
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,759
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stewart and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a conversation</font>

823
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:25,859
about whether or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there's a better</font>

824
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:28,950
way to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stewart so if you go</font>

825
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:30,328
think about it and so we that could turn

826
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:32,939
out in a variety of ways but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway so</font>

827
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:35,609
the idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basically two databases</font>

828
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,249
to two places where data about names are

829
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:40,130
stored in the home net and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

830
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:42,350
to do a multi

831
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,660
multi sub-domain homenet architecture

832
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:46,490
both of these well actually no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

833
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,190
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forward would be duplicated or</font>

834
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:51,160
where there would be two of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

835
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">a question of public versus local public</font>

836
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,180
is stuff that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> visible from the</font>

837
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,950
internet if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a global domain</font>

838
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:59,569
name if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home net has a global domain</font>

839
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,930
name you would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go type</font>

840
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:05,690
nslookup or dig and then some name and

841
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,799
in principle it would look it up of

842
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,690
course we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to publish</font>

843
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,190
necessarily every name that appears in

844
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,500
the whole net out on the global internet

845
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,480
so that the public don't domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

846
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,430
public namespace is kind of a Babel

847
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,650
rised version of the private domains

848
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,839
domain space with not as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in</font>

849
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,220
it private domain space is expected to

850
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,130
contain every name that's published in

851
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,450
the home net so that way you can

852
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:27,740
discover all the services in the home

853
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,740
that you can talk you know between

854
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:33,160
subnets you can talk to devices in the

855
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,720
home that so forth there's a question

856
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,299
that I had as to whether we also need a

857
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,560
guest namespace the reason you might

858
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,990
want to do that is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a friend</font>

859
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,299
come over your friend you want to play

860
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,339
some you know p2p game with your friend

861
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,330
you want to be able to rendezvous but

862
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't really want to give your</font>

863
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,420
friend the keys to the kingdom you don't

864
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,850
want them on your main Network you want

865
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,230
them on your guest network so maybe we

866
00:43:52,850 --> 00:44:00,470
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve that problem the current</font>

867
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:02,090
draft doesn't and then a the document is

868
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,250
written with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption that we want</font>

869
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:07,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to support the use case where</font>

870
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:12,680
the home that actually has a publicly

871
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:14,629
reachable domain name in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS but</font>

872
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,129
also it has to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there it doesn't</font>

873
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so it talks about a home homenet a</font>

874
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:25,970
special-use TLD could be dot home I i

875
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:28,130
chose got home that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was pretty</font>

876
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,529
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that dot home had conflicts and</font>

877
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,080
wasn't a good idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tim which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hinske</font>

878
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:34,280
is nodding yes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll take that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

879
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">having been a good idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

880
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,040
actually think it sounds better so

881
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,170
anyway uh so that's the basic high level

882
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:47,800
view of what what names look like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

883
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:49,119
in the home net um and then next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

884
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,769
so

885
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:56,819
database so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about two different</font>

886
00:44:53,769 --> 00:45:00,788
views of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database and actually</font>

887
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:03,670
there's notionally probably I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

888
00:45:00,789 --> 00:45:05,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking that the private the local</font>

889
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:06,999
version of the database would be the

890
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:08,049
ideal view of the database with all of

891
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,939
the data in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but actually I don't</font>

892
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:12,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's correct and you'll see why</font>

893
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:15,009
in a minute so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's sort of</font>

894
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:16,689
an ideal version that has everything in

895
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:18,700
it that's what gets updated<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's what we</font>

896
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,339
collect from mdns or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS updates</font>

897
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,549
from services and that's maintained as a

898
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:28,480
database which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is shared either</font>

899
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:32,319
using an authoritative primary name

900
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,450
server or using<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of other</font>

901
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:36,038
mechanism but I assume in the document

902
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just enough off NS an</font>

903
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:43,690
authoritative name server and then uh

904
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:45,999
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public and private the public</font>

905
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,619
and local I said private on the slide

906
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:49,149
but I that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

907
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:53,019
private because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody could get onto</font>

908
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,849
the network that isn't you and they can

909
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:56,379
see it so that's not private but the

910
00:45:54,849 --> 00:46:00,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">public and local views of the database</font>

911
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,859
are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they could be DNS</font>

912
00:46:00,069 --> 00:46:08,049
zones that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> derived from Miss DNS own</font>

913
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:12,400
programmatically and then the public and

914
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:15,400
private<font color="#CCCCCC"> names private zones have the</font>

915
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:17,230
same external name so if they have a

916
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,539
global name that name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same and</font>

917
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,819
what which zone you see depends on

918
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:23,619
whether you're at home or whether you're

919
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:25,450
away from home if you're away from home

920
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:28,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">you only see public names if you're at</font>

921
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">home you see all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the names and</font>

922
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,430
there's also about home that namespace

923
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:34,809
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those that's the names will</font>

924
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:40,569
always appear in the domain names

925
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:43,930
namespace and the reverse zones will

926
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:45,609
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind of treatment and they</font>

927
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:47,440
appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the home net whether</font>

928
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:48,759
whether there's a delegation for them or

929
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,619
not I'll get into that in a minute but

930
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:52,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've here in the home that even if</font>

931
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:55,930
even if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP didn't delegate you that</font>

932
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:59,460
prefix the the reverse tree for that

933
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,460
prefix next slide

934
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:10,880
so when I was writing this I dread the

935
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,348
mtns hybrid draft and it didn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

936
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,480
quite knew what I wanted and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

937
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:17,950
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conform this to it i conformed</font>

938
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I decided that I'd rather change it</font>

939
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,930
which may or may not have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right</font>

940
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,070
decision and that's something the

941
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:26,990
working group should should think about

942
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:28,280
but in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion it's it's not quite</font>

943
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and there are a couple of reasons</font>

944
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,710
that are described in the document i'm

945
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,470
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into it here unless</font>

946
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:35,869
people want to but my feeling is we

947
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,879
needed to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> something new it would</font>

948
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:41,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">work a bit like mdns i would but not</font>

949
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,820
exactly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately what we really</font>

950
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:46,990
want is for servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the home net to</font>

951
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:49,369
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns updates with a with a secure key</font>

952
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,930
mechanism that uses you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

953
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:52,550
first first come first serve if you

954
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:54,020
claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put your key on it</font>

955
00:47:52,550 --> 00:47:57,260
and someone else can't come later and

956
00:47:54,020 --> 00:48:01,310
say no wait that's my name because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

957
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:02,810
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key so so that's the the</font>

958
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term goal is that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

959
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,830
that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term goal no devices</font>

960
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently do that I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think any</font>

961
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:11,240
device manufacturer has even you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

962
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,618
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that and whether they</font>

963
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,450
would do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we wrote a spec that</font>

964
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">told them how I don't know it's quite</font>

965
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,629
possible they would not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but maybe they</font>

966
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:22,010
would so I I'd like to do I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

967
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:25,760
that just because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

968
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:28,490
good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that option Tim Tim Chang</font>

969
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,680
so yeah as Stewart says in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hyper</font>

970
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">foxy draw the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hobby proxy solution is a</font>

971
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:36,529
pragmatic thing for now right yeah in

972
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:41,240
the absence of DNS update being widely

973
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:43,070
available yeah well you know yeah the

974
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:46,549
other thing I've got ringing in my ears

975
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:49,490
sort of even I can't hear is two or 3i

976
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:51,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">ETFs ago and someone gave the chairs of</font>

977
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:54,080
the NSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're good slapping for</font>

978
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:57,348
assuming a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> english-language</font>

979
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:59,930
domain name for for this you might want

980
00:48:57,349 --> 00:49:02,240
to in the document use el q DN whatever

981
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:04,490
the language we used in the architecture

982
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:09,310
document is rather than assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

983
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:09,310
home or home net or whatever perhaps

984
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,860
are you talking about the the the static

985
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:21,240
with the sort of special use domain like

986
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:24,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> home net all right now we have to</font>

987
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:28,529
register a special-use domain for every

988
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:33,110
language that could get pretty ugly but

989
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:36,030
yeah okay point taken next slide I think

990
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,260
can you remind me<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that and maybe we</font>

991
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,510
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit because I</font>

992
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,060
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea how to address</font>

993
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:44,820
that and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you do at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

994
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:46,140
more so than I I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to</font>

995
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,300
do it at the mic I think everybody will

996
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,770
be horribly bored by it so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

997
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,260
an answer but I think in a way it was a

998
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:55,370
valid point but I yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> points a valid</font>

999
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:58,260
point to I just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

1000
00:49:55,370 --> 00:50:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so global domain names i mentioned</font>

1001
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:04,050
that that ideally or perhaps not ideally

1002
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:06,180
but at least optionally home that should

1003
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:08,250
have a name that the names that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that</font>

1004
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,040
are known on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> home that should be</font>

1005
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,570
knowable from the internet and in order

1006
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen the home that has to</font>

1007
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:18,090
have a global name a name that appears

1008
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,710
in the domain name system and in order

1009
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:22,410
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to happen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there has to be some</font>

1010
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:24,360
process for making it happen you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1011
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,710
probably most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in the room</font>

1012
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,590
are familiar with the process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1013
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:30,750
to your local domain name registrar and

1014
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,180
registering a name and then going to

1015
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:36,330
your local well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about that in</font>

1016
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,399
a minute but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's going</font>

1017
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:41,370
to really work for a home that because

1018
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,900
you know let's face it we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

1019
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:44,819
better at dealing with registrar's than

1020
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:46,410
the average person and and and i don't

1021
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,790
want everybody who has a home that and

1022
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,370
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a public name to have to</font>

1023
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:53,640
learn how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to a registrar so i</font>

1024
00:50:50,370 --> 00:51:01,380
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this requires a new service</font>

1025
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:03,420
which I have called you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know global name</font>

1026
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:05,520
registration provider and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea here</font>

1027
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,620
is essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home that needs</font>

1028
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,570
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some kind of probably</font>

1029
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,120
restful api or something I got a little

1030
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:14,220
bit slap for saying restful api because

1031
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,109
that assumes a solution which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

1032
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:19,169
which isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily the right thing</font>

1033
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:22,309
but some kind of API that allows the

1034
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:26,509
user to pick a name

1035
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:28,969
probably not a like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a domain few</font>

1036
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:31,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">com that I've had since like 1997 or</font>

1037
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:33,709
something like that or no well yeah

1038
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:35,449
probably 1987 anyway so I don't expect

1039
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:38,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">them to get that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect them to get</font>

1040
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:40,789
something more like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> appleberry</font>

1041
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,828
you calm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've got a</font>

1042
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:44,989
unique name and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be very</font>

1043
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:48,319
cheaply done and it can all be done with

1044
00:51:44,989 --> 00:51:54,859
with you know HTTP requests for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

1045
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:56,930
part in one of the things that I'd like

1046
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:59,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">this service to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provide is also a pki</font>

1047
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:02,569
search for the name because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1048
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:04,130
have DKI then you're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1049
00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:06,019
kinds of warnings from your browser if

1050
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:11,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">you try to try to do secure connections</font>

1051
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:13,848
to the to the web api for the for the

1052
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:15,079
for the home that and assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1053
00:52:13,849 --> 00:52:19,219
there is a way baby I for the home that

1054
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,170
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's extremely bad designed</font>

1055
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,209
to set things up so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people see</font>

1056
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:25,309
those security warnings I'd actually

1057
00:52:23,209 --> 00:52:27,140
rather not encrypt and have them see

1058
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:29,959
that warning because that warning trains

1059
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,819
them to click through the warning and

1060
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:33,319
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a battle that can't be won</font>

1061
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:38,329
but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should be on</font>

1062
00:52:33,319 --> 00:52:41,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong side of it the gunner can be</font>

1063
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">provided by the ISP doesn't have to be</font>

1064
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,400
and it shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be required that it be</font>

1065
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:47,900
provided by the ISP the ISP does have to

1066
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,829
the reverse on delegation because they

1067
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:53,569
on the address space the mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

1068
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:55,579
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> specified I'm not sure exactly</font>

1069
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:56,929
where that's going to happen or if it's

1070
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:58,819
going to happen I think it should happen

1071
00:52:56,929 --> 00:53:01,729
and and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a place where it</font>

1072
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:03,558
happened and then I think also the

1073
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:05,989
delegation the reverse requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> us back</font>

1074
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,089
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danny amigo has worked a bit on this</font>

1075
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:10,729
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with Daniel a bit I</font>

1076
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:13,339
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually looked too closely at</font>

1077
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:15,229
Daniel's drafts for a while and so I

1078
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:16,729
need to rethink in this was something

1079
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:18,879
that the chairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1080
00:53:16,729 --> 00:53:21,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier I need to rethink whether or</font>

1081
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,579
exactly how those fit into what's

1082
00:53:21,229 --> 00:53:24,259
written in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document and whether i</font>

1083
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:31,939
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change this document or suggest</font>

1084
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:34,299
changes the Daniel next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide so the</font>

1085
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:37,558
home that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Navy architecture assumes that</font>

1086
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:42,429
naming is secure on the home net and

1087
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:44,410
that's a not that hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if</font>

1088
00:53:42,429 --> 00:53:45,759
you have a global name it's a pretty

1089
00:53:44,410 --> 00:53:48,390
hard problem though if you don't have a

1090
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:50,999
global name because currently a

1091
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:55,179
validating resolver has no way to

1092
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:57,609
establish trust for a local zone that is

1093
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:59,170
has the same name as that equivalent

1094
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:01,420
zone and everybody else's house if

1095
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:09,099
everybody has got home net how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1096
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:11,349
establish trust so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I express an idea for</font>

1097
00:54:09,099 --> 00:54:14,049
using a sort of a trust on first use

1098
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:16,349
model in the document where the home

1099
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:19,019
that publishes a unique use a unique

1100
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:21,339
universally unique identifier which is a

1101
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:22,598
randomly generated number that's big

1102
00:54:21,339 --> 00:54:25,929
enough that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very unlikely that</font>

1103
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:28,599
there would be a collision and then the

1104
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:31,569
dot home that name the definite domain

1105
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:34,179
for your got home net will have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> uuid</font>

1106
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:37,479
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than the uuid for a</font>

1107
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:41,259
different home net and that zone will be

1108
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:44,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">signed with a key that is that that</font>

1109
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:45,849
proves that that uuid is claimed by that

1110
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:47,769
zone it doesn't you could have a clash

1111
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:50,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">two different home that's could have the</font>

1112
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:52,660
same uid just by random incredibly bad

1113
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:54,249
luck but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that happened you would get</font>

1114
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,868
a validation failure and so the right

1115
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,879
thing would essentially occur because

1116
00:54:55,869 --> 00:55:00,219
chances are you you've got the UID for

1117
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,029
your home net before you got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> uid for</font>

1118
00:55:00,219 --> 00:55:05,890
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own net and so so essentially that</font>

1119
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:09,099
zone is assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the key and that the</font>

1120
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:10,420
uid is enclosed in the zone so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1121
00:55:09,099 --> 00:55:11,829
that whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to different home</font>

1122
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">nets you can tell which home that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1123
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:16,179
on and whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually trust it or</font>

1124
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:18,428
not and then then you can do secured

1125
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:20,049
name resolution in those home nets that

1126
00:55:18,429 --> 00:55:22,719
you've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust using the trust</font>

1127
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:25,239
on first use model Dave seems excited

1128
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:27,999
about saying something about this ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> de</font>

1129
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:30,579
feeler I'm actually confused so I was

1130
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:32,618
going to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you could elaborate what</font>

1131
00:55:30,579 --> 00:55:35,319
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's two home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ads they</font>

1132
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:36,880
have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> uu IDs yes both of those</font>

1133
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:40,869
home nuts have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine in it with a</font>

1134
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,599
names a banana okay okay both both your

1135
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:45,090
house and my house have a machine in it

1136
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:48,270
hosting it with the name banana

1137
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:50,700
I have my laptop i'm currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

1138
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,980
at your house and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm trying to resolve</font>

1139
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:55,230
banana dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> homenet what are you saying</font>

1140
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,000
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what is how</font>

1141
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,670
to security work that is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> excellent</font>

1142
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,790
question to which i did not express an

1143
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:05,520
answer in the document and should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have I</font>

1144
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:12,390
don't see any answer and so I think the

1145
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:13,800
the answer is difficult so and it sort

1146
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:17,129
of depends on whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're whether</font>

1147
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,100
you're well one answer would be to say

1148
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:22,170
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have ambiguous names like banana</font>

1149
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:23,610
dome net sorry you don't get security

1150
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:28,140
don't do that use the global name

1151
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually that doesn't work the reason</font>

1152
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,859
they don't is anything else yes right no

1153
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,750
no I mean the model the problem is that

1154
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you're in someone else's home that</font>

1155
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,810
ok you know that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a different</font>

1156
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">home that but you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy of</font>

1157
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,040
this of your home that's zone so how do

1158
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:43,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that name exists in your</font>

1159
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,210
home that's zone you don't I thought

1160
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you had an architecture for doing a</font>

1161
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:49,050
remote resolution you do is it does that

1162
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:51,450
mean that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you look up the</font>

1163
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,740
name well so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in the case</font>

1164
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the resolution you</font>

1165
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,310
have a global name so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have an</font>

1166
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:58,140
ambiguity and be good at saying yeah I

1167
00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that could possibly work and have</font>

1168
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:02,430
and be secured but of course it has some

1169
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,110
usability well how do i get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global</font>

1170
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:05,640
name that song as you talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> for but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1171
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:08,400
don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's any solution for</font>

1172
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,540
the ambiguous name Omega there isn't I

1173
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,410
don't know how it's possible to secure

1174
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:14,759
that in have a good user experience

1175
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:17,580
sorry yeah and I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1176
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,110
the way you secure the only way that I

1177
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,730
can think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to secure that is basically</font>

1178
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have an application that needs to</font>

1179
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:25,590
have a trust relationship with that

1180
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:29,790
particular device to cash that devices

1181
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:31,860
key and then it can look at the at the

1182
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:33,120
name entry and see if it's got the same

1183
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:37,080
key and if it doesn't then it doesn't

1184
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:38,640
use it but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of kludgy so and</font>

1185
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,259
it requires applications to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1186
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,420
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'd rather applications didn't</font>

1187
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,740
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to do so I yeah there</font>

1188
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't a great solution to this problem</font>

1189
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:49,319
and it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1190
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:51,990
think about but but I'm not confident

1191
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:57,380
that we'll come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer so</font>

1192
00:57:51,990 --> 00:58:02,750
next slide so there's two models of man

1193
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:07,220
for the home that and we I needed to

1194
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about this because I don't go into</font>

1195
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,990
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides but there's a whole</font>

1196
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:14,980
issue with with data recovery in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1197
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:16,879
case of loss so you know honet routers

1198
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:19,790
people don't think of them as having

1199
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,380
precious data on them and so it would

1200
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be at all shocking for somebody to</font>

1201
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,910
take their soul homenet router that has

1202
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:27,080
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their keys on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and chuck it and</font>

1203
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,180
replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a different home</font>

1204
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">netrunner without ever realizing that</font>

1205
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:35,270
they're screwing themselves and so there

1206
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,770
needs to be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of provision for</font>

1207
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,440
how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that requires</font>

1208
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:41,180
some kind of management API and there's

1209
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,710
two different models<font color="#E5E5E5"> for managing it one</font>

1210
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:44,540
is that the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> user manages that the</font>

1211
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:46,430
other is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end user contracts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1212
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:48,230
management out to someone like their<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1213
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:51,500
or some others on<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party service</font>

1214
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:52,700
provider and so there's there's text in

1215
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:56,240
the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that deals with both of</font>

1216
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">those use cases user management through</font>

1217
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,479
the browser as I mentioned earlier

1218
00:58:57,350 --> 00:59:01,490
requires some kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki if you don't</font>

1219
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:02,810
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki you don't have a secure</font>

1220
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:03,890
connection connection to the browser you

1221
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:06,560
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tell you're talking to the</font>

1222
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:08,990
right thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might say things to</font>

1223
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,049
someone else's home that that you don't

1224
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:13,490
want to say so we have to have that

1225
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,870
another way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which also helps</font>

1226
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:16,640
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key problem is if you had an</font>

1227
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:21,020
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your iPhone or your</font>

1228
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:26,509
Android phone or your sailfish phone or

1229
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:30,890
whatever you could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have your</font>

1230
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:32,300
phone cash the keys and then that way if

1231
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,950
you if you blow away your home that you

1232
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,870
can recover<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with the data that you</font>

1233
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:37,279
saved on your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if we want to do</font>

1234
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:38,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a standard API or</font>

1235
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,770
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a million different</font>

1236
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:41,780
apps out there always do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1237
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:43,190
different and use you know cobbled

1238
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,200
together ad hoc stuff that doesn't

1239
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:47,990
really work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we get lock in and on</font>

1240
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:51,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">interop and that sucks and then for the</font>

1241
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:53,180
central management case you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1242
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,950
I explain the use case there I think

1243
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,330
netconf yang or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> restful api is</font>

1244
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,529
probably the way to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

1245
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,720
comfy hang because there seems to be a

1246
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:01,580
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of energy behind that</font>

1247
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:06,080
model in the in the industry right now

1248
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:09,620
um and obviously if we do that we need a

1249
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,220
way to provision it and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1250
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,509
corollary to all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

1251
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,490
really talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about something that</font>

1252
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:15,810
belongs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home net management</font>

1253
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:19,410
architecture document which does not

1254
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:21,690
exist um so that's something that that

1255
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:24,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably merits further exploration</font>

1256
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,410
next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should tell her question</font>

1257
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the chair on that one I'm a</font>

1258
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:29,460
particularly with respect to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

1259
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:32,129
and scope of home net which is unmanaged

1260
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,619
networks when you're talking about the

1261
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,869
central management on this slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

1262
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:40,290
eviscerated something simply where the

1263
01:00:36,869 --> 01:00:44,430
centralized system is providing almost

1264
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:45,869
rendezvous service or you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

1265
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:49,259
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> something where third party is</font>

1266
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:52,640
performing the management I was from

1267
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:54,900
techNavio's I box where<font color="#CCCCCC"> an S box is</font>

1268
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,460
rendezvoused with external systems and

1269
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">could be managed through those but they</font>

1270
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:03,900
do not actually manage the box per se so

1271
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason why that's there is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> realize</font>

1272
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that is in fact a little out of</font>

1273
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,868
scope for home that but the reason why

1274
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:11,369
that's there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1275
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:13,200
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the situation that we have with</font>

1276
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:14,820
practically every other IOT device and

1277
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,500
on the planet which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't</font>

1278
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:19,800
a management way there isn't a way to

1279
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,630
have it be managed that is not

1280
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:24,780
controlled by the person that sold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1281
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:26,670
you so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't if we don't do this</font>

1282
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:29,130
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wind up with all these</font>

1283
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:30,930
routers looking like nest boxes and nest

1284
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:32,880
boxes are great they're very pretty they

1285
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:34,259
pervert provide good functionality but I

1286
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,910
don't like lock-in and I don't think

1287
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,330
lock in is what the IETF should be

1288
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,290
encouraging and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to</font>

1289
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:42,240
discourage it should we choose to do so

1290
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:48,650
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do need to address this use</font>

1291
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:54,270
case so okay yeah so anyway next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

1292
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:56,460
so one additional thing that i will just

1293
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:59,730
interject here before we actually take

1294
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the process of</font>

1295
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,330
writing as it became clear to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1296
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:06,420
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have we really need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1297
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:09,240
home net security architecture and we

1298
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1299
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,118
right in here are written kind of

1300
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,619
assuming that there is a home net

1301
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,020
security architecture that just

1302
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:19,500
magically will<font color="#E5E5E5"> here as a result</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1303
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,240
vacuum that this document creates so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1304
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,340
actually in the process of formulating

1305
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,959
in my head what I

1306
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,250
that architecture should say and I'd

1307
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,300
love it if there would be people that

1308
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:29,990
would be interested in collaborating

1309
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,340
with me on that but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a whole</font>

1310
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:33,439
lot more to say about it than that at

1311
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:36,080
the moment yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the shares we</font>

1312
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:40,310
would strongly encourage that it is one

1313
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:43,069
of our charter areas it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen so</font>

1314
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:44,060
send me mail if you want or you know if

1315
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,170
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a competing</font>

1316
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:47,480
document cuz you think I'm an idiot

1317
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:49,700
which I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure people do that's okay too</font>

1318
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,320
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any attachment to that</font>

1319
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:52,730
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1320
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,990
needs to be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if I have nobody</font>

1321
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:58,100
else is going to do it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1322
01:02:53,990 --> 01:03:00,410
it so Lee Lee Howard<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I was a</font>

1323
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:01,370
little too loud Lee Howard<font color="#CCCCCC"> um this is</font>

1324
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,069
one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> points of course where I</font>

1325
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">always say hey we need a document and</font>

1326
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,010
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> out then I always like to point</font>

1327
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:08,750
out to anybody in user land when

1328
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:10,460
somebody says we need a document if

1329
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,050
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> always wanted to author an</font>

1330
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,420
internet draft that can become an RFC

1331
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:16,100
this is your chance there's a dot

1332
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:17,570
there's a space here waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1333
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:21,410
name on it which is not what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up</font>

1334
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:23,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say um there are two things 1i didn't</font>

1335
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:28,220
stand up fast enough when you're talking

1336
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:31,879
about the population<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the population</font>

1337
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:34,129
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global zones and you said and the</font>

1338
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:38,030
isp should delegate the reverse to the

1339
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:40,040
to the home gateway cam um ok well the

1340
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:41,390
document says should because the

1341
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:44,120
documents issued the document says

1342
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:47,600
should to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP yes actually it's not</font>

1343
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:49,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">a capital should oh yeah yeah right yeah</font>

1344
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know there are no RFC 2119 key</font>

1345
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,810
words in the document so when I said

1346
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,220
should that was my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal opinion it's</font>

1347
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:57,320
not something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the ITF</font>

1348
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,120
should dictate talk to operators and

1349
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:01,160
that's exactly what I wanted to hear yes

1350
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,040
very much I am perfectly content to use

1351
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,230
the word should in on non RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2119</font>

1352
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:10,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">contexts I'm happy with that the other</font>

1353
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:15,440
one is I haven't quite spent enough time

1354
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:17,150
looking at the gunner that seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit</font>

1355
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,640
seems big yes he's like you're doing a

1356
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:21,200
lot there yes which I think we're really

1357
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to socialize I'm not even</font>

1358
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:25,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that's actually a charter it may be</font>

1359
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:26,780
uh yeah no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said that when I</font>

1360
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,130
presented it's a pretty big<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I</font>

1361
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:32,560
don't even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to do it yet yes</font>

1362
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:35,260
gonna be okay yeah thanks yeah Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

1363
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,390
hi I'm Andrew Sullivan um

1364
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:41,410
so first of all thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for writing</font>

1365
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:45,670
this because it's valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

1366
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:49,390
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fairly serious gap in the</font>

1367
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:51,640
document unless I overlooked it and that

1368
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:54,819
is if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of globally</font>

1369
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:57,640
ambiguous name um lots of stuff doesn't

1370
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">work yes and and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to</font>

1371
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,660
sort of state that innocent single

1372
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,120
sentence up front because it actually

1373
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,859
removes a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of confusion and after the</font>

1374
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:07,720
third reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realized oh i see this</font>

1375
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,130
just doesn't work in that case right so

1376
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,490
there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will help</font>

1377
01:05:09,130 --> 01:05:14,200
yes well I wrote this before I spent

1378
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:16,810
about three days thinking about that

1379
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem and so so there yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

1380
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:21,640
a very good point but um and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1381
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:24,160
guess just on the other on another issue

1382
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,779
on because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want it I don't want</font>

1383
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,310
to fully explore this rat hole but we

1384
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,620
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it earlier and</font>

1385
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:32,140
that is this internationalization yeah

1386
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:34,029
there's a thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came up in the</font>

1387
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,520
image a broom and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1388
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:41,320
important difference right the the names

1389
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:44,230
in mdns the the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> label is is hidden</font>

1390
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:46,510
in the UI and the point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with</font>

1391
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> globally ambiguous name is that</font>

1392
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:50,560
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to be hidden i think yeah</font>

1393
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:51,850
unless we think that unless we think

1394
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something we want to impose</font>

1395
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:56,110
on user interfaces which i think would

1396
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,930
be an interesting adventure for the ITF

1397
01:05:56,110 --> 01:06:00,700
to start yeah so so that's a really

1398
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,899
important difference and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1399
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,500
there are internationalization

1400
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:06,300
considerations the IETF actually has a

1401
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:10,060
requirement for internationalization

1402
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,950
considerations which is honored as far

1403
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:15,310
as i can tell entirely by ignoring it

1404
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:18,129
but but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be problematic</font>

1405
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:20,740
here and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fundamentally</font>

1406
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:23,290
unsolvable problem so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm glad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1407
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:25,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've embraced that you know and held on</font>

1408
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:27,610
tight yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually so so a</font>

1409
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">little anecdote from from ancient days</font>

1410
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:33,610
at deck we had this problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1411
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:35,919
couldn't sell our devices in certain i

1412
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:37,360
guess in the EU<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatever predated the</font>

1413
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,130
EU because i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure that you it</font>

1414
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:44,500
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know anyway so we</font>

1415
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:46,240
changed all of the names although<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

1416
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,930
the words that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were used in the bootrom</font>

1417
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,790
which is

1418
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:50,919
place where this was an issue all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1419
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,950
words were changed so that they didn't

1420
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:56,980
have any any vowels in them so they

1421
01:06:53,950 --> 01:07:00,399
weren't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> English words and I think</font>

1422
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit too too</font>

1423
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,210
little for this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it may be</font>

1424
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,770
that what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want I see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that home that is that it is mnemonic</font>

1427
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,490
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if there was something</font>

01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:19,000
you know yeah well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so that you</font>

1431
01:07:16,569 --> 01:07:24,819
understand the number of thorns that you

1432
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:28,480
have just grasp yesterday at the H&R see

1433

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the human rights research group</font>

1434
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:32,290
somebody gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> a presentation about a</font>

write in arabic using arabic script

01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:39,849
including like never using um left to

1438
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,460
write scripts and it turns out not to

1439
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:46,800
work very well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

Stuart Stuart treasure a quick comment

1442
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:54,400
on this subject the international text

1443
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:57,040
we need to make a distinction between

1444
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:00,069
what goes over the wire and what users

1445
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,930
see and in an ideal world those don't

1446
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:06,220
need to be the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing if we if we</font>

1447
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:09,098
define that<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net is a special label</font>

1448
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:12,069
that signifies these non-global unique

1449
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:14,170
names then the UI layer of the software

1450
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:16,420
can show a little picture of your house

1451
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:18,940
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in italics or however we</font>

1452
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:20,319
want to represent that are in a

1453
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:22,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">different language but on the wire it</font>

1454
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,730
has to be the same string because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1455
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,290
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to visit Canada and find my</font>

1456
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:28,330
iphone doesn't work because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1457
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:30,310
speaking French on the wire so right

1458
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:32,229
wire it has to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same language</font>

1459
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:33,790
worldwide you know and it is a little

1460
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:36,608
bit unfortunate that we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

1461
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:38,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">English mnemonics in those wire formats</font>

1462
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:42,160
because it's convenient for debugging

1463
01:08:38,219 --> 01:08:44,410
but that damage is mitigated if the user

1464
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,719
never sees it when I tap the air print

1465
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:49,389
button on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone and it says turn</font>

1466
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,569
printer I'm not seeing any dot local or

1467
01:08:49,390 --> 01:08:54,520
IPP or and many other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are in</font>

1468
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:55,810
heretical yeah and actually one of the

1469
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,460
things that's missing from the home net

1470
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,810
architecture document on that naming

1471
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,819
architecture document is currently

1472
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:04,810
written is that

1473
01:09:00,819 --> 01:09:07,389
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hybrid DNS document you talk</font>

1474
01:09:04,810 --> 01:09:10,540
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have hierarchical</font>

1475
01:09:07,389 --> 01:09:12,569
names so building<font color="#E5E5E5"> one printer one and</font>

1476
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:14,799
you know you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1477
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:16,449
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for your home net</font>

1478
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:18,099
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give your home that a name and</font>

1479
01:09:16,448 --> 01:09:19,629
then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're somewhere else do you</font>

1480
01:09:18,099 --> 01:09:21,460
see a different hierarchical name<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1481
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:24,130
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see predator one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:31,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think it's the same printer the</font>

1484
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:35,109
one issue with the using using something

1485
01:09:31,988 --> 01:09:36,399
other than what's on the wire is that it

1486
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,380
has to be something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

1487
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:40,629
would not clash with names that could be

1488
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:45,099
allocated nice so your icon of a house

1489
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:50,139
is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that then doesn't</font>

1490
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:52,060
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for blind users and doesn't work</font>

1491
01:09:50,139 --> 01:09:53,949
for although<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the icon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1492
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:56,079
house could have a internationalized

1493
01:09:53,948 --> 01:09:57,549
mnemonic but but we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be careful</font>

1494
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,889
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't wind up with the blind</font>

1495
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:04,690
user thinking that it's a domain in that

1496
01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:08,070
case so it's it yeah walk so<font color="#CCCCCC"> relying</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Marcus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stenberg from a few moments ago</font>

1502
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:21,369
normal browse one with domains includes

1503
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:23,530
domain names also in service names in

1507
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,840
my my own comment is it was energy

1508
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:38,310
future and it raised this first about

1509
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:40,960
six or seven meetings ago very vocally

1510
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:43,659
that we should be considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1511
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,239
somehow and I do remember from a recent

1512
01:10:43,659 --> 01:10:48,989
discussion on some list that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

1513
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:52,030
allocations I think home<font color="#E5E5E5"> corp and</font>

1514
01:10:48,989 --> 01:10:54,519
another domain were part to be punted

1515
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:56,170
back to the ITF or not to be discussed

1516
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:58,570
here I'm sure with those there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1517
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:00,460
those three new gTLDs that were not

1518
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:03,099
allocated on the basis the ITF<font color="#CCCCCC"> light</font>

1519
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:04,389
looks decent yes well they aren't

1520
01:11:03,099 --> 01:11:11,469
allocated they're just they're just

1521
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:12,320
marked do not allocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we still</font>

1522
01:11:11,469 --> 01:11:14,750
have plenty of time

1523
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,579
discussion unusually haven't got the

1524
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:20,570
root walls out of the way that's step

1525
01:11:16,579 --> 01:11:22,099
forward again<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten chance so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1526
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:24,139
popped you an email about it but it is

1527
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:27,739
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very busy time did you read</font>

1528
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:30,050
Marcus's hybrid proxy zeroconf draft

1529
01:11:27,739 --> 01:11:32,449
it's not cited in this but it's

1530
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:35,119
essentially part for publication as a

1531
01:11:32,449 --> 01:11:37,909
way of auto configuring IP proxy in a

1532
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:40,519
home net and yeah so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already say</font>

1533
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:42,949
that I hope not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> poppy worth before</font>

1534
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:46,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">see you everyone there's losing there's</font>

1535
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:47,839
a little bit of you know man I've been

1536
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:49,190
meaning to do this for a while and

1537
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:52,400
there's the deadline I'd better get

1538
01:11:49,190 --> 01:11:55,250
going on in this document so so yeah

1539
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,019
there needs to be a probably a dash

1540
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:58,460
there's a dash 0 1 coming with

1541
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:59,540
everybody's comments and the things that

1542
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:01,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've learned since then but they're</font>

1543
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,869
probably needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a dash 0 to where I</font>

1544
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:05,089

01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:31,848
oh dear<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you I'm sure I'm Tim</font>

1556
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,429
not delegate those but as yet there are

1557
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:43,059
still at least ten outstanding

1558
01:12:40,429 --> 01:12:46,909
applications for home they've yet to

1559
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:50,570
withdraw their interest are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ask him to create some kind</font>

of hierarchy for this kind of special

1571
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:18,320
well so that's a topic that we probably

1572
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:21,679
really don't want to get into here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1573
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,969
you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in that</font>

1574
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,880
topic we're going to be discussing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

1575
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:28,250
dns off on friday yeah

1576
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,600
30 without my check out on actually

1577
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:31,550
there may be some mileage in that other

1580
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:41,060
dash dash is a nate is this is actually

01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">a name spacing there and you can't have</font>

1582
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:46,610
a normal name with the dash dash in it

1583
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so not standing that's not</font>

01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:51,500
check the user friendly that might

1585
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:53,750
mitigate some of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems yeah</font>

1586
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:55,429
without my hair chattel yeah we would

1587
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:59,300
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the name is not</font>

1588
01:13:55,429 --> 01:14:01,040

01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:04,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written by somebody who never</font>

1590
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,980
read in RFC which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very common thing</font>

1591
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:09,949
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's constrained to the home</font>

1592
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:11,388
that maybe that's safe but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

1593
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:13,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get into the case where</font>

1594
01:14:11,389 --> 01:14:16,280
people do sanity checking on names and

1595
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:19,009
they're like oh dash that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> X M</font>

1596
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,809
dash dash that's not a valid domain name

1597
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just reject that will give you an</font>

1598
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:25,940
error and then you grossed<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't you</font>

1599
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,989
can't use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so we don't want to</font>

1600
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,969
do that Andrew Andrew Sullivan's so so

1601
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:33,980
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the the very adventure that I</font>

1602
01:14:31,969 --> 01:14:37,850
suggested earlier we might not want to

1603
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:39,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into right because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the reason xn</font>

1604
01:14:37,850 --> 01:14:41,810
minus minus ended up being used for I

1605
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:43,670
DNA is because it's internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain</font>

1606
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:46,010
internationalized domain names or

1607
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:48,710
applications and so every application

1608
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:50,330
needs to become I DNA aware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if what</font>

1609
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,460
you're saying is in order to use this

1610
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:54,199
mechanism you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to have home</font>

1611
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:56,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">Neto air applications I think we're</font>

1612
01:14:54,199 --> 01:14:58,059
going to be in a world of hurt yeah like

1613
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that doesn't meet the</font>

1614
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:03,590
requirements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we set for ourselves</font>

1615
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:05,690
now I it would solve this problem in

1616
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:08,210
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just scope things in a</font>

1617
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:10,849
new you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a through z</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a through z</font>

1618
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:13,400
minus minus patterned name and then you

1619
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:15,260
peel all scoped but it has this<font color="#E5E5E5"> nasty</font>

1620
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:17,420
property that now we're starting to

1621
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,790
specify stuff at the wire format in

1622
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:23,270
order to in order to enable certain you

1623
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:26,179
I behaviors<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right maybe it's the</font>

1624
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:28,400
right thing to do but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1625
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:29,870
certainly want at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least you know us to</font>

1626
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,370
look at the Charter and our other

1627
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:34,429
documents in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that</font>

1628
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">determination yeah i guess i would say</font>

1629
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:36,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my personal perspective i have</font>

1630
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:40,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero</font>

1631
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:44,690
Oh enthusiasm from going down that<font color="#E5E5E5"> rat</font>

1632
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hole yeah sorry Andrew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before you walk</font>

1633
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:52,339
too far away and again no chair hat on

1634
01:15:49,370 --> 01:15:56,950
here I mean I thinking was that using

1635
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:56,950
the a-to-z A to Z dash dash mechanism

1636
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:02,750
that doesn't it I mean compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for</font>

1637
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:05,180
example that homeless or at home we

1638
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,860
would still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that problem of having</font>

1639
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,480
a home little where application

1640
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:12,259
potentially if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of</font>

1641
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:14,150
special reservation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think possibly</font>

1642
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:16,310
their scope with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACC HTC dash dash</font>

1643
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:18,170
of at least being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a name</font>

1644
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:21,920
which has no possibility of a collision

1645
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:25,430
in the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> namespaces people are</font>

1646
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:30,680
currently registering things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> um okay</font>

1647
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:33,710
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like I don't I don't want to fully</font>

1648
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:38,300
build out the rat alcohol and like build

1649
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:41,570
a basement rec room but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibn a</font>

1650
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:43,640
reserved everything of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern a to</font>

1651
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:46,670
Zed a to z minus minus a chi almost

1652
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:49,490
autumn so they're reserved and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

1653
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:50,960
was if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to do like nasty hack</font>

1654
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:53,630
like this again then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do it</font>

1655
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:56,630
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so home that is in the position</font>

1656
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:58,340
in fact to specify that the problem is

1657
01:16:56,630 --> 01:17:00,200
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are rules out there that</font>

1658
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:02,240
currently prevent it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them of</font>

1659
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:05,120
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> are on the registration side I</font>

1660
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:09,679
don't know very many applications that

1661
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:12,320
do validation of label strings at look

1662
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:13,790
up time so so you might you might be

1663
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,410
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with that of course</font>

1664
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:17,660
there is the additional problem that if

1665
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:20,269
we thought that home net was um you know

1666
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:22,940
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> user-friendly for the portion of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1667
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:27,050
population<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't use Latin</font>

1668
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:31,400
characters um you know mq minus minus

1669
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:33,290
something is even worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um and I'm</font>

1670
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:36,259
not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's gonna you know no</font>

1671
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:38,660
description we could have NH n minus

1672
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:40,610
minus I suppose for home net but I'm not

1673
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,040
sure that that helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> us I'm particularly</font>

1674
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:44,570
since since Arabic speakers for instance

1675
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:48,880
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the notion of initialization</font>

1676
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:48,880
which is not a thing in Arabic languages

1677
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:55,010
Lee Howard well at least if you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1678
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:57,530
impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember and use then</font>

1679
01:17:55,010 --> 01:18:01,640
nobody will try right that's

1680
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:04,070
internationalized actually and we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1681
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,750
do it from the jabber room which

1682
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,490
fantastic conversation the jabber room

1683
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:09,200
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there you know good stuff</font>

1684
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:13,550
going on there too are you missing out

1685
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not excluded if I know sorry their</font>

1686
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:18,260
logs you can read it<font color="#CCCCCC"> later um that I</font>

1687
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:19,309
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we need some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name nerds to get</font>

1688
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:23,030
in the room I know we tried to do a

1689
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:27,020
design team and you know maybe somebody

1690
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:29,690
needs to buy a round<font color="#E5E5E5"> of beers and and</font>

1691
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:32,480
see if we can hash out all the

1692
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:34,669
possibilities I'm not qualified to to

1693
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:36,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">weigh in it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like we need</font>

1694
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:38,210
to move this one board somehow and I

1695
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:40,130
feel like this is one where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1696
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:44,240
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stuck for three years trying</font>

1697
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:49,850
to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the name is yeah</font>

1698
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:54,170
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do that yeah okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

1699
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:56,840
comments on this one okay so my initial

1700
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:58,340
feel is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's too early to be</font>

1701
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,840
talking about adoption of this draft

1702
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,480
that is gonna need<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least a couple of</font>

1703
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,370
iterations and and significant

1704
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:06,679
contributions if not additional authors

1705
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:09,440
well yes head before can get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1706
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:11,870
point yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we had some volunteers</font>

1707
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,210
that time didn't permit them to

1708
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:16,070
contribute at this point well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> text</font>

1709
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:20,510
I'm didn't give them time to confirm<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1710
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:24,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">my lame oh my yeah so so there was a</font>

1711
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:25,970
design team I the design team hadn't

1712
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:27,530
done anything for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of ATF's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1713
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:29,840
think or at least one I know what wasn't

1714
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:31,910
that little no we have not formally

1715
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,220
credited design team for this there was

1716
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:38,510
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request the last meeting for</font>

1717
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,980
essentially volunteers to write a draft

1718
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:42,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would become this but it wasn't</font>

1719
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:45,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">form reasons the design team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay anyway</font>

1720
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:48,680
we have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> come a few volunteers for</font>

1721
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:50,690
that ultimately you volunteer to take

1722
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:53,270
the lead and then things went a little

1723
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:55,009
quiet and then you had a big Russian

1724
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:58,100
nobody else it's time to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> laying</font>

1725
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:59,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">by that point yeah so anyway yeah so I</font>

1726
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,100
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact is there were a number of</font>

1727
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,050
other people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were interested in</font>

1728
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:06,980
writing parts of this document including

1729
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:12,050
andrew and i would still like it if

1730
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:13,099
those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would help yeah so say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1731
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:16,220
would be good to get at least another

1732
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:18,680
clot yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know we already have some</font>

1733
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:20,740
proposed changes to do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dash 0 1</font>

1734
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,090
quite shortly on the individual draft

1735
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:24,440
but i think it's clearly clearly some

1736
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,670
fairly substantive additional

1737
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,019
contributions before we can look at

1738
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:28,730
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could take for the</font>

1739
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">work and route document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wish we can</font>

1740
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:33,049
gather one group consensus yeah yeah and

1741
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,240
there's also i mean just just I don't

1742
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:37,490
know how deep to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this but</font>

1743
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:42,170
there's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious list of</font>

1744
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:44,000
follow-on documents for this that you

1745
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,050
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people see something in</font>

1746
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,150
there and they're like ooh I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1747
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">write that document they might want to</font>

1748
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:52,099
mention it yeah and I think leaf is

1749
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,120
earlier comment yes if I mean we ever

1750
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:55,220
says we should write you talking about

1751
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,260
this come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do it because it's</font>

1752
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,970

1753
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:03,440
