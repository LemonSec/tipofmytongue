32
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,169

slide please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so at the last IETF</font>

42
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:16,479
meeting um we went through the services

43
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:18,580
that are discussed in RFC 45 94<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

44
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,310
this draft which basically duplicates

45
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,750
those services and had a fair discussion

46
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:27,310
and walked away basically understanding

47
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,289
that the working group was saying that

48
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:33,039
they were fine with the services that we

49
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:37,210
offered and then the chair of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rich</font>

50
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,440
working group does she chair it the

51
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,469
chair of the right working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

52
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,310
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> was came up and said oh by the</font>

53
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:48,639
way you didn't reference my RFC or our

54
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,289
RSC and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way our deserve good</font>

55
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
points and services<font color="#CCCCCC"> were all different</font>

56
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:58,000
so could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please do something about</font>

57
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:01,388
that so Tim and I went in and did a fair

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,050
bit of analysis looked at looked at the

59
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:07,539
bad RFC pretty hard and she's right

60
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,300
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> services are all different it's an</font>

61
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,190
overlapping set of good points

62
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:16,930
normalizing the thing in this

63
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:20,320
specification is just plain hard so what

64
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,960
we wound up doing was we inserted a

65
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:27,659
paragraph but you can read here if you

66
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,599
have microscope that says in a nutshell

67
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,289
yes there is this other RFC we don't

68
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to know</font>

69
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:42,580
moyes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we think that a user of</font>

70
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:45,610
this RFC and of RFC 45 94 and the entire

71
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:49,210
diffserv set of services that it's based

72
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:52,569
on ah that needs to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM a</font>

73
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,808
system is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to do dscp</font>

74
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,639
translation at that boundary which is

75
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,319
described in the diff serve architecture

76
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,800
it's how you handle different<font color="#CCCCCC"> disks or</font>

77
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,749
domains and sorry they're different

78
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,309
deserve domains and you translate at

79
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:13,389
that point and did I say anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

80
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:20,279
there um no that's literally what I said

81
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:20,279
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of my presentation so</font>

82
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:26,379
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for I have two questions</font>

83
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,319
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> working group one of them is is</font>

84
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:37,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay with that</font>

85
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:40,449
outcome with respect to RFC 7561 yes no

86
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:42,189
indifferent we can take comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

87
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:45,729
anybody's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments we can also of</font>

88
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,779
course and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:52,959
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are here we could probably</font>

90
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:56,019
hum um what are my questions on what are

91
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,199
you okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or on this well yeah</font>

92
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:01,779
okay if we need people to comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

93
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:05,290
they've looked at this yeah has anybody

94
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:08,470
looked at this and have opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

95
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,969
particular paragraph the drafts been

96
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,610
around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while and we just added an</font>

97
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,610
extra paragraph so I guess we need

98
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:20,019
eyeballs on it and yeah so obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

discussion on this draft and since it's

143
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,660
an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> to RSC 3168 which is a</font>

144
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,310
RFC maintained by this working group

145
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,290
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited the authors to come here</font>

146
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,479
I'm an author but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing at</font>

147
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,829
the moment my Michael's going to the

148
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:17,540
talk over to you Michael thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

149
00:12:12,829 --> 00:12:20,359
yeah so the context of that is the

150
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,949
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence from 3168 it gives</font>

151
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,720
context it says the dance system should

152
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:26,810
react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to congestion at most once per</font>

153
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,940
window of data most most once per round

154
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,920
trip time so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something we're</font>

155
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,750
criticizing or changing or anything the

156
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,860
point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a specific</font>

157
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:39,019
contents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> context that rrc 3168 sets</font>

158
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,600
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other proposals in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the space</font>

159
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:47,480
of using easy n and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not about</font>

160
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,940
them it's about this context next there

161
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problematic text there is a well</font>

162
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:53,360
the two separate paragraphs in two

163
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,009
different places second one is easy to

164
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,060
miss we missed it in the previous

165
00:12:55,009 --> 00:13:00,399
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the draft also in our</font>

166
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,439
conversation so but I've seen it<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

167
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,569
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first text says that</font>

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the indication of congestion should be</font>

169
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:12,740
treated just as a congestion loss in a

170
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:15,709
non<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy incapable tcp and this means</font>

171
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,750
having the congestion window that's

172
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:20,060
using a lowercase should but it's it's

173
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,410
seems to be a clear recommendation but

174
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is also another text that says</font>

175
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,839
upon the receipt of an easy incapable

176
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:29,029
transport of a single seed packet the

177
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,380
buyer such a transport the concessions

178
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,600
were algorithm follow that the ancestors

179
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,680
must be essentially the same as the

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,649
congestion which corresponds to a single

181
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,329
drop packets essentially the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

182
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:41,959
think from the other context is clear

183
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:44,300
that this means having for example for

184
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,829
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and capable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp the sources source</font>

185
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,930
TTP's required to have its congestion

186
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:49,880
windows those explained here for any

187
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:55,910
window of data containing either packet

188
00:13:49,880 --> 00:14:00,380
drop or an easy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> indication next so</font>

189
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,540
the issue here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this rule creates</font>

190
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">poor link utilization whenever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font>

191
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,930
smoke use when you ecn mark at a point

192
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,370
in the queue or you know even if it's

193
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point as loss when you do that</font>

194
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,520
at the point that is way below the

195
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:18,020
pencil a product you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could use</font>

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,910
small utilization with this in

197
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,829
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> with modern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm algorithms I</font>

198
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,410
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want and this</font>

199
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:28,790
rule prevents us from utilizing the

200
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:30,650
knowledge that ecn gives us which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

201
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,329
that we actually have an indicator here

202
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,550
that the queue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily a</font>

203
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:40,370
panel today product so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

204
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:43,189
think this rule is harmful next so there

205
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,980
was a Dadaist is this draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corey</font>

206
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,900
has already briefly introduced it was

207
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,240
the reason most recent version is called

208
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph cadamia alternate back off easy on</font>

209
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,750
03 this draft was presented in TC p.m.

210
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:59,510
in ITF program<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yokohama</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was done</font>

211
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,700
later discussed in icc edgy it changes

212
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:05,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">to send a reaction to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy n and it</font>

213
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,510
proposes new language for this RFC 3168

214
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:13,190
this combination turned out not to be

215
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:15,710
good so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we plan as a next step step to</font>

216
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,670
split the draft into a PS update to our

217
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:22,040
C 3168 that just fixes these statements

218
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,360
that I showed you and the short draft to

219
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,180
recommend an appropriate congestion

220
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,680
response now the first thing is

221
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,150
underlined this means this come with

222
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk here is just about this first</font>

223
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:36,620
draft next so the question I'm asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,810
whether this working group will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

225
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,180
will whether there is energy and

226
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:44,150
interest in this working group in on in

227
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:47,959
adopting an up kind up coming post

228
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:50,630
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that will just update the</font>

229
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,780
text of RFC 3168 and to no longer

230
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,610
recommend that you would have liked you

231
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">would react just like you would</font>

232
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:05,680
recollect to loss when you get an easy n

233
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:08,420

235
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,260
cuz i think i've missed the slot i<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

236
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:19,400
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking in but answering</font>

237
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:21,560
your question would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you be opposed to</font>

238
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">adding a bit more stuff in here to</font>

239
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,569
update our esli 3168 as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know i've</font>

240
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">been talking with praveen</font>

241
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:33,680
about some of the control packets that

242
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:36,440
have to not be easy and capable and

243
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,569
things like that and and now there's

244
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,330
some work needs to be done before that

245
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were allowed to be easy and capable</font>

246
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,060
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be better to pile more things</font>

247
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,430
into one update and have lots of little

248
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,819
updates I don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it would</font>

249
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,229
hold hand back your one I guess my

250
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer depends on how much it is and</font>

251
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,750
what it is and we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> kids per case not</font>

252
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,890
not in principle of all we control

253
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,780
everything yeah and I'll put my chair

254
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,980
hats on rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> my author Hut for</font>

255
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,750
that one and just say that if the

256
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,620
working group or adopts this then of

257
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,199
course the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wiccan group will have</font>

258
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:14,899
consensus about what goes in but we

259
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,070
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add feature after</font>

260
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,600
feature to this eventually that

261
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,359
documents going to have to be updated

262
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,550
and probably abyss issued and so we want

263
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and keep it well focused but if</font>

264
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,159
there's something pressing that the

265
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,690
wicket really feel should be changed

266
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:37,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it's wrong then we should do all</font>

267
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:43,220
the corrections yeah 3168 if you went 61

268
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:48,709
9847 um don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want hi uh Brian Trammell</font>

269
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:49,850
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah um just a clarifying question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

270
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,260
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure I understand exactly</font>

271
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,360
what you're trying to do with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> PS</font>

272
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,850
update you're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just removing</font>

273
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,030
those restrictions so is it so that

274
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:01,040
other things can be done in the envy

275
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,260
informational or experimental the other

276
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,730
document yes what's your your plan for

277
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other document is informational at</font>

278
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,140
this point or experimental not

279
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,350
informational experimental probably go

280
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:17,060
um yes then do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think it's pretty</font>

281
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:19,129
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get done I would be um skeptical</font>

282
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:22,580
of trying to say oh well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only get to</font>

283
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,020
update 3168 every and moons and we have

284
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,080
to throw all of the stuff in there this

285
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,120
is not an ietf process document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

286
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,600
it's a pretty easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> slam dunk to just get</font>

287
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:36,580
the thing done um so I'm definitely in

288
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:39,260
support of okay thanks alright thank you

289
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,280
Eric not mark this sounds useful but I

290
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,780
didn't quite understand why

291
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,730
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> split them in two separate</font>

292
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,490
documents as opposed to having the PS

293
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,830
update update the PS as well as having

<font color="#E5E5E5">non-normative test text saying well</font>

295
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,230
here's a possible algorithm that

296
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:58,190
satisfies to both constraints we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

298
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,060
there's one standing behind you he

whatever you think is it good or bad

301
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea why because there's an implementer</font>

302
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,709
it's easier if it's one document that

303
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,480
says oh yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know go find it one</font>

304
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,220

308
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:26,210
say and the the practice a parameter not

309
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,360
an algorithm so the update it proposes

310
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,370
to allow a range of parameters and then

311
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,050
the specific one is to choose a

312
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:38,870
parameter which they think is safe a

313
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:40,909

332
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,230
wonder if there is you know

333
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,350
experimentation to make it proposed

334
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:28,840
standard immediately I don't understand

335
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:30,560
that the store could you speak up I

336
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,419
wonder if there is enough

337
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,050
experimentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it proposed</font>

338
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:38,060
standard immediately if there is enough

339
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:41,510
experimentation to make a pee hole with

340
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,110
other values than 0.5 is that where you

341
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:49,520
are I mean there are several things that

342
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:52,669
may go wrong first of all the when you

343
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,240
are now using fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> size as we are you</font>

345
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,870
it works correctly when you an

clarification<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you d are you saying</font>

368
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,770
there should be a reduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of at least</font>

369
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:23,240
one MSS<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh is that lot of something like</font>

370
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe so there are things like</font>

371
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that which deserve some experimentation</font>

372
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,979
before going TS in my own and you think

373
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,450
you can get experimental evidence for

374
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,720
the so you think we have to use our

375
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,000
engineering judgment but is that is the

376
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,100
reduction by one ms s something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,600
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> experimentally or something for</font>

378
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,520
which really need engineering judgment

379
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,909
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can see the logic of discussing</font>

380
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,270
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe you can do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so</font>

381
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:53,090
there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> we pick a algorithm</font>

382
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:55,550
one because we judge it to be safe and

383
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,480
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can measure it and</font>

384
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:02,090
we can know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is safe it seems</font>

385
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there might be at least a case for</font>

386
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,699
discussing a one MSS reduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as an</font>

387
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,110
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

388
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,809
because we consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a working group</font>

389
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:14,000
that that's a safe thing to do without

390
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:15,440
necessarily doing an experimentation to

391
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,840
confirm it because we understand how the

392
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,289
congestion behavior works so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking</font>

393
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,970
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you feel that to verify that choice</font>

394
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,980
you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need experimental</font>

395
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,720
results or whether we perhaps could make

396
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,350
engineering decisions what was your

397
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,559
feeling more I'm not quite sure but yeah

398
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:36,860
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering is your son is</font>

399
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:38,870
enough hmm because at least that I

400
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,729
believe I I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what what</font>

401
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,209
happens if you do it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a correct way</font>

402
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,059
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are certain cases that that</font>

403
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be very carefully design so the</font>

404
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:52,340
context is not enough that's the point

405
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,470
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question</font>

406
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,870
is this what your proposed is a specific

407
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,779
to the reduction to<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter the reaction</font>

408
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:04,850
too easy n or what this also apply to a

409
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:07,730
lost signal partly yes so so this is

410
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,199
what we reaction with small windows it's

411
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:13,480
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loss paste but</font>

412
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,690
you're the first recover it's different

413
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:28,730
of course based recovery handles this

414
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:29,929
correctly there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so okay</font>

415
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is one of the good things about</font>

416
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:36,139
bringing things to the ITF you can get

417
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:38,330
discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topics and it's good</font>

420
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,789
decide whether this is a correct hope

00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,789
for doing this activity and whether

422
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:55,820
whether we should do it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

anyone who wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak on again on</font>

424
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,789
whether we should do this as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity</font>

425
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,789
or whether we should avoid doing this

426

concern that if different<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP responded</font>

431
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:30,689
to eating differently from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

432
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,490
it it would create a safety problem if

433
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,830
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that there would be</font>

434
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:40,470
people stretching the numbers further

435
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:44,909
and further if you like and so I mean

436
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:51,679
I'm fairly well known for<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worrying</font>

437
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:54,809
too much about rape fairness but the

438
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,110
difficulty of getting together some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

439
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:59,668
that allows us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow a bit of leeway</font>

440
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,229
but not too much he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

441
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:05,370
difficult was all I'm saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

442
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:07,740
it's it and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just having one</font>

443
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,989
number I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's the right idea</font>

444
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,210
cuz that that's a bit too specific you

445
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,919
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's trying to summarize that</font>

446
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,100
that's what the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line this slide</font>

447
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,620
says then which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is find some text to set</font>

448
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:23,370
some bones the appropriate relaxation

449
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:26,219
but don't set the number in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this PS all</font>

450
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:30,510
right yeah is that what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is</font>

451
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay um as a process i'm not saying</font>

452
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,620
anything's okay or not okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

453
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,809
saying in the thought how you would

454
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:40,320
write this text in such a way that it

455
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:42,270
would be clear enough and you can find

456
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,730
enough but also flexible enough you know

457
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,879
you know that's why we have working

458
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:50,010
groups to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work it would take</font>

459
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,169
more comments while we're taking comment

460
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,600
I'll make a procedural note we can't

461
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:56,820
adopt a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't actually on the</font>

462
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,709
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want you to be doing an</font>

463
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,559
adoption call today so we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

464
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,000
a discussion prior to in the future and

465
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,500
you draft appearing and then adoption

466
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">column but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a working group</font>

467
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,590
meeting here where a massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion so</font>

468
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,049
please come to the back you have

469
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:14,070
opinions so we get to be picky in the

470
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:16,530
worker meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so I do have one</font>

471
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and that is that I believe that</font>

472
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,110
IETF 94

473
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,750
you had what amounted to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> barb off and</font>

474
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:26,918
we're discussing an alternative back off

475
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:29,799
proposal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I walked away from that</font>

476
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,900
I I wasn't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to attend I had</font>

477
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,000
a conflicting thing but I walked away

478
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,929
from it with the idea that you had some

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,549
intellectual property do you well

480
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:46,059
somebody has some intellectual property

481
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:52,389
somebody has that is there and what what

482
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:55,090
is the status of that especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> spin</font>

483
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:57,549
tonight yep i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure why it's</font>

484
00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:01,480
relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but the status is it's</font>

485
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:03,940
not being declared yet it's not

486
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,950
undeclared yet and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually okay</font>

487
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">i assume a declaration is coming at some</font>

488
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:12,730
point but is that going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an issue</font>

489
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,270
where are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be tripping over</font>

490
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:19,770
ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that no not an issue for</font>

491
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,770
what Michaels trying to do here at all

492
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,200
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michael can you go to the next</font>

493
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,939
slide next cuz we have the actual

494
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,860
practice out the previous slide Oh is

495
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,600
there then we have that yeah they

496
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,979
dropped on top is an extra slide yeah so

497
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:42,520
Michael um now just just showed up real

498
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:45,820
quick so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ooh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text and make it go</font>

499
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,850
away because I actually yeah cuz so I've

500
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:51,549
actually had a look at it and um then

501
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,469
what but yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know no I really</font>

502
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:57,490
really really don't if he wants it I

503
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,860
really don't I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

504
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:01,870
the debate about this text yet I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

505
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,879
say that we're gonna adopt it first I

506
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,699
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say now that I've actually seen</font>

507
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,919
the text this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good start I think we</font>

508
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,710
can quibble about the numbers a little

509
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:13,030
bit um I'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you offline</font>

510
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">about like where you know where the</font>

511
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:16,450
numbers came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from I think there's number</font>

512
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,820
equivalent to be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

513
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,909
should happen within the working group

514
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:23,559
and unless the new area directors are

515
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:27,700
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reorganizational change</font>

516
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,049
to where the ecn stuff lives then this

517
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,630
would be the working report right so

518
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:32,020
this is the ecn maintenance and minor

519
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,500
extent

520
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:39,190
working group is traditionally the ecn

521
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:42,610
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Grissom ok trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer both</font>

522
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,890
questions so no that's fine Brian and

523
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm keen on people quibbling with stuff

524
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,980
and making comments here because it

525
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,360
indicates some energy to actually do the

526
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,120
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be done to get that</font>

527
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:59,919
text just right so that's good you're me

528
00:29:52,120 --> 00:30:02,080
to start growing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my mirror make you</font>

529
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,490
live in turn also i'm i'm not super sure

530
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,760
how the text should look like this this

531
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not cool i know i don't want it go</font>

532
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,960
into details but MC I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying it's</font>

533
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,870
not not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to get it right not</font>

534
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,300
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright we can get it yes I agree</font>

535
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,590
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other question</font>

536
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:22,659
is do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the draft and I</font>

537
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,639
agree that what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in the draft</font>

538
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,710
is extremely confusing and should not

539
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,820
have been written that way but I'm still

540
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,500
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update the</font>

541
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,300
draft because it's still written in a

542
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,010
way where it actually kind of could be

543
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to do what we wanna do it update</font>

544
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:40,300
which dropped<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sorry not drive the RC</font>

545
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:42,820
ah ok well because like<font color="#CCCCCC"> any overseas 13</font>

546
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,310
yo's now you have to be difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

547
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the wrong side take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other one</font>

548
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,050
oh yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> which one do you want this</font>

549
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,520
yeah sure nick sonyae so I didn't want

550
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be picky but this is essentially</font>

551
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,420
right and just you know changing your

552
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,679
number from 0 point 5 to point season<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7</font>

553
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,700
might still essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same</font>

554
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:05,860
reaction or whatever I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

555
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:09,070
like yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I didn't</font>

556
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,459
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as Nikki I'm just saying I'm</font>

557
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:14,050
just saying I'm I understand that it

558
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:16,090
would be nice to clean it up but i'm not

559
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure how correct we can get it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

560
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:22,810
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if the update is needed but</font>

561
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:28,660
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just I'm sure that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mirror</font>

562
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:30,129
I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so right ok so now I have to</font>

563
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,370
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a working group sure what I'm</font>

564
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,380
recommending what I'm recommending is at

565
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:41,159
least people have opinions on this which

566
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:41,160
is good news and I'm I

567
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,710
would personally encourage that we try

568
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,510
and find a a document that clarifies

569
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,330
this point because we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

570
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:54,160
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecn in various forms as</font>

571
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,010
things go forward we keep advocating the

572
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,050
use of ecn I've always had a lurking

573
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,710
concern that if we do this then we have

574
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear about what 3168 says so I</font>

575
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:05,890
would encourage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resubmit the</font>

576
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,560
draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go to the working group</font>

577
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,780
and ask if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can adopt it here as a</font>

578
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,550
work item to work upon and if you're

579
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,920
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that please do split at the second</font>

580
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,300
document because we should be discussing

581
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,850
the number while we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

582
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:20,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could make two documents bring</font>

583
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,620
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the working group and then let's</font>

584
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,240
talk about it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a good</font>

585
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,649
thing i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think if we can come up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

586
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,210
text that actually everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can agree</font>

587
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,100
to and that totally makes sense at the

588
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,160
end then why not updating a right but

589
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,600
like even even and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we should</font>

590
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:38,410
work on this so that's something I'm

591
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,909
sure and the point is even if we adopt

592
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,620
the working the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document and then we</font>

593
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,600
cannot come to a text that actually

594
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:45,909
makes sense we don't have to update it

595
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,080
it's like only<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually can find</font>

596
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that makes sense we have no</font>

597
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">because an ad problem then at some point</font>

598
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,630
we have to decide what do with the work

599
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:55,300
item but for the moment that's the

600
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,470
planet<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that let this place make two</font>

601
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,530
drafts and bring it to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

602
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,760
receives as energy yeah in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I</font>

603
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,040
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more discussion</font>

604
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,740
before we add a milestone you would like

605
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,180
one more discussion on the extra text

606
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:12,730
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> atomized stone is that mirror</font>

607
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:17,820
as mirror or is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marisa support your</font>

608
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,820
daughter it's my personal opinion here

609
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:27,460
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what that means it was</font>

610
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:29,500
totally confused so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say just</font>

611
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,510
just read the draft submitted<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

612
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,940
group and figure out what's going and

613
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,260
then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see how it ends up it was</font>

614
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,580
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Corey was saying the</font>

615
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,990
word and wise don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome</font>

616
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:44,889
what's kind of like just just do it all

617
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:47,110
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you have an action when</font>

618
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,450
King do it for Michael when can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

619
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:53,110
it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're going to revise the</font>

620
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:55,180
draft I always ask this ah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> as is</font>

621
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,080
it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next month yes something like</font>

622
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

623
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,580
is that good enough this is a famous

624
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:09,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">link give me another one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too cool once</font>

625
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:12,040
Jeff time<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you 1.5 right fine okay</font>

626
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:13,810
and so we've reached the end of our

627
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,040
agenda but we didn't we didn't get Bob

628
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,540
schedule so we need to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

629
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,139
showed your Bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob would you like to</font>

630
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:27,219
talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EC entendre no easy and</font>

631
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:35,820
over there too which is this that's fine

632
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:48,158
we all right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub turnin</font>

633
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:53,879
around um hello oh is it ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gary here</font>

634
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:56,830
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font>

635
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,549
so the purpose is to give guidelines to

636
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:04,089
protocol designers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer 2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tunnel</font>

637
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:07,839
protocol designers on how to ensure he

638
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:10,480
CN is correctly put into their design

639
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Floyd cross-layer and we've also</font>

640
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,410
been doing some liaisons with other

641
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:19,029
groups that<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing layer two</font>

them to catch any<font color="#E5E5E5"> systematic layering</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about other reason well so</font>

648
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:42,640
the the activity on a 3gpp one we have a

663
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:50,940
freaky BP so I've got another slide on

664
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,339
the other recent activity but lighter

665
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,369
from this graph is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rated to another</font>

666
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:00,119
legend critical trill presentation

667
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:01,829
earlier this week on that oh and that's

668
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,119
actually redesigning easy and supporting

669
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:07,940
drill because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed trill and</font>

670
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,729
finally there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some discussion on</font>

671
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:14,869
how to apply a large number<font color="#CCCCCC"> for both</font>

672
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:17,489
static on space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

673
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:21,930
what a couple of slides on the first one

674
00:37:17,489 --> 00:37:24,180
one on each on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vast the 3gpp liaison</font>

675
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,038
context don't forget to read that

676
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,299
essentially it says we believe there

677
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:30,599
could be problems here it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

678
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:36,239
you've not may be fully understood iris

679
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:37,650
lee 3168 and that's about obviously 3168

680
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:42,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">again if we've already said is quite</font>

681
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:46,769
unclear and just got bigger and bigger

682
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:50,879
so the context that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of talking about</font>

683
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:56,549
is mostly go but you know the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

684
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:59,430
station which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lie to device and GTP</font>

685
00:37:56,549 --> 00:38:04,079
tunneled information comes in and it

686
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:09,569
goes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> pptp which you pack it take to</font>

687
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:14,430
something convergys protocols and run so

688
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:17,499
anyway next slide these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

689
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:27,109
specs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read</font>

690
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:30,379
most of them are about yeah and the

691
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:34,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">poles ones are normative or they</font>

692
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:36,979
mentioned easier normatively only mine

693
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:41,150
3gpp normative rules are different from

694
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:44,479
ITF and the italic ones the bold italic

695
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:47,839
ones sorry the normative ones were the

696
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:50,029
ones that we were told mentioned ecn

697
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:52,119
normatively and the italic ones ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

698
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:57,019
found some normative easy and texting

699
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,849
but we were told ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so I it made a</font>

700
00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:00,558
difference in my definition of normative

701
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:02,539
to yours but they might offense<font color="#CCCCCC"> insureds</font>

702
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:10,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">other than whether there's normative</font>

703
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">public it anyway top of a summary all</font>

704
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:18,199
nearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ecn in RTP</font>

705
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:21,079
UDP and all of that stuff seemed fine it

706
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:24,049
was people it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> made me realize just</font>

707
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:27,920
how complicated mobile network is how

708
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:30,609
many boxes have to say yes we understand

<font color="#CCCCCC">we found maybe there are some other</font>

727
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:29,720
problems with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> first is talking about</font>

728
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:34,160
reading and<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the ECT</font>

729
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:39,410
no point on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> node that isn't I peer to</font>

730
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,029
be idea where it's a if you went<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

731
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:45,879
that layering diagram I showed earlier

732
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:48,590
it's a layer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these the under IP node</font>

733
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,580
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be clear or what</font>

734
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:59,030
it means when when a NOP is reading and

735
00:40:52,580 --> 00:41:01,220
writing the IP header and secondly the

736
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,510
mark on behavior not just the protocol

737
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,830
mechanisms but the behavior is very

738
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:08,630
unclear and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that highlights a</font>

739
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:12,259
difficulty enough having<font color="#E5E5E5"> 31-6 gauges</font>

740
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:15,140
matches where as much to blame it like

741
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,580
so next yeah so maybe this is the reason

742
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,520
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to write this document</font>

743
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:29,869
in fact yeah yeah yeah so it's not

744
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:34,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">really quick system show the layers me</font>

745
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:39,160
across from the leave the user equipment

746
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:43,849
and I've highlighted here some of the

747
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,589
protocols going on so firstly there

748
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:48,619
doesn't seem to be any spare anywhere

749
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:52,310
that refers to I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60 40</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which says</font>

750
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:56,089
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACN gets propagated in tunnel and I</font>

00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:59,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be tamil hard to have all this</font>

00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:02,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">GDP stuff going on that that ought to</font>

753
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,380
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> given even the level of detail at</font>

754
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:08,210
which RTP has been specified for all the

755
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,160
middle policies to get it right I would

756
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:15,260
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> also that the tunnel endpoints</font>

757
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:18,049
have to refer to obviously 6044<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a</font>

758
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">i hope this largely 6014 isn't clear</font>

759
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:29,240
that it covers<font color="#E5E5E5"> GTP and that's going to</font>

00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">be on the last slide secondly it talks</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PDC p header which implies that</font>

762
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:39,140
it's only thinking in the downstream

00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:40,069
direction and downward<font color="#CCCCCC"> those oubli also</font>

00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:52,190
would be writing into the GTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> italy NOP</font>

767
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:57,410
and then when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> as easy and co point</font>

768
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:58,999
in the PDC p as to use which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it must be the easy and header inside</font>

772
00:43:07,369 --> 00:43:12,559
wrong but i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it has and so</font>

773
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:15,259
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's these questions how's</font>

774
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,269
it know they're particularly because

775
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,499
there may be a robust robust<font color="#CCCCCC"> header</font>

776
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:21,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">compression especially in this is a</font>

777
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:25,160
voice service so the IP header inside I

778
00:43:21,229 --> 00:43:27,669
not have an immediately obvious to bcn

779
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,930
built it may be compressed no yeah it's

780
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:34,789
I'm not sure how anyone could implement

781
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:36,410
this right so at least in theory some of

782
00:43:34,789 --> 00:43:37,849
the rock mods will transport those bit

783
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:46,279
but not be visible because<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be rock</font>

784
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:49,930

785
00:43:46,279 --> 00:43:52,789
this into a formal yeah because Lecter

00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,979
that seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that seems to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

788
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:58,729

very much for the great work at it and

811
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:02,930
for even opening dead specs like 23 or

812
00:45:00,019 --> 00:45:06,078
whatever that was so that's really

813

you get this rolling and we can maybe

815
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:14,689
talk offline them how to best push this

816
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:18,829
into the right working groups thanks a

definer thanks Bob think our greatest

819
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:26,319
great work and we talked about hcn could

820
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:34,249
this also scale two things up<font color="#E5E5E5"> connects</font>

821
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:36,319
for example yeah so could the work we

822
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:38,538
make a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more generic so to speak to</font>

823
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,670
say well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the ecn co point</font>

824
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:46,069
that others we should be getting access

825
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:48,049
to for this drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> around so long not</font>

826
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:50,058
extended scopus I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

827
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:52,969
publish it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one of them right</font>

828
00:45:50,059 --> 00:45:55,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">through there yeah sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we could</font>

829
00:45:52,969 --> 00:46:02,359
take some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the thinking maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with in</font>

830
00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">3gpp yeah thanks right there is one more</font>

831
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:12,078
sites are about<font color="#CCCCCC"> three PP which about the</font>

832
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:15,469
Mafia well<font color="#CCCCCC"> away but it's that he talks</font>

833
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:19,189
about marking and congestion is if it's

834
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:21,519
a sort of on our state<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it gives the</font>

835
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">implications that it will then start</font>

836
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,758
setting the sea bit all the time and

837
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,140
then when the injection finished it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

838
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:31,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">people turning off it's not absolutely</font>

839
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:34,098
clear but if the codecs are expecting

840
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:36,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's what they respond to if</font>

841
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:39,380
you get some congestion in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal TV</font>

842
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:42,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">network outside it's going to not doing</font>

843
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,239
that and and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> credits could really</font>

844
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,949
feel with other or we have to

845
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:50,509
standardize one which i think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'd</font>

846
00:46:48,949 --> 00:46:53,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">be best to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spend those and more</font>

847
00:46:50,509 --> 00:46:56,539
randomized behavior that is normally

848
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:59,178
make um but I don't exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

849
00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:01,339
intended or what<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone's implemented so</font>

850
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:03,199
that that's a bit more difficult issue

851
00:47:01,339 --> 00:47:05,150
because I know the 3gpp probably doesn't

852
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,320
want to spend those too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

853
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:10,240
behavior

854
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,610
I think we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen these issues talked</font>

855
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,589
about before so important things to call

856
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:20,560
this house and also to reply to them and

857
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:22,150
see what the feedback is it's more about

858
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,250
constraints on behavior that doesn't

859
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:26,410
seem to be specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be</font>

860
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:33,250
somewhere and i'm founder yeah right

861
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:34,720
next trip right trail the only reason

862
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:38,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm bringing this out is this could be</font>

863
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,750
quite independent but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put the</font>

864
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:45,490
driver I think that the draw<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new mural</font>

865
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:48,670
work improve our school but we had an

866
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,950
idea on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and supporting</font>

867
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,440
trail that if we both<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to the</font>

868
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:55,149
drawers as a more general case because

869
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,090
there's a there's a list of ideas

870
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:01,180
perhaps or ecn in there and the way

871
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:03,430
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> trailer is hopefully this</font>

872
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,910
way when we presented this morning which

873
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:08,919
I said this is really cool if it's a

874
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,750
it's a really easy neat way of doing

875
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:16,120
surveys and if the reason it's cool is

876
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:19,060
because Trillo has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> properly</font>

877
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:22,810
designed for forward compatibility for

878
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:26,549
things that come along later and it's

879
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:30,549
made it really easy to do all right and

880
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,410
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not yet in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft but it will</font>

881
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,990
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing into that draft within the</font>

882
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:43,480
next 1.5 months i believe is the current

883
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:44,830
fashion so when it's on 01<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the idea</font>

884
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get the slides for the</font>

885
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:50,200
session early right next is updating

886
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:54,100
some specs and this is a more processed

887
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,379
question we ask this on the list and lay

888
00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:04,259
flat homie reply and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

889
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until i get require one the</font>

890
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6040 was</font>

891
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:18,850
written and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wrote it but obviously we</font>

892
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:22,720
all wrote it in the end the it says

893
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:28,360
but if you it was it scopus Becky

894
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:30,700
tunnels and he didn't cater for the case

895
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,310
where you've got an idea nike tunnel

896
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,770
with the shimmy in between H which can't

897
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:38,620
exist independently so it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be put</font>

898
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:40,780
on by the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> node here as the IP</font>

899
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,870
header because it's a it's definitely a

900
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,760
shame it's not a header and all we

901
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:48,400
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to do was just extend</font>

902
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,840
scope just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit to cover all</font>

903
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,390
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> places and we did it so I'd like</font>

904
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to update as a proposed standard that</font>

905
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:01,509
what we're talking about here is vcp and

906
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,470
I don't think well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be like I said</font>

907
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:07,450
that any advice is that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp cannot</font>

908
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">later proposed ended with a maybe the</font>

909
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:17,500
brute is that correct probably but look

910
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:20,350
less less not less not and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

911
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,420
having that discussion here so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

912
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,250
tell us what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think and then we're</font>

913
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:32,920
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss you don't work to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

914
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:35,530
a wall chair this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is another another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

915
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">only proposed standard as a piece for 64</font>

916
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:41,860
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better by the</font>

917
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:43,810
cleaner so wanting to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6040</font>

918
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,760
they don't know how to read this massive

919
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:48,820
long easy any capsulation justify this

920
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,710
one sec I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be very clear</font>

921
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,150
about tunnels in general because there's

922
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,040
a growing number of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we got to</font>

923
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:57,130
offer good advice to people making them

924
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,840
and I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop creating</font>

925
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,970
new tunnels to keep doing things but

926
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,950
well I can't predict the future and then

927
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,230
I suspect people will steal still find

928
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:06,640
new uses for new tunnels and all the one

929
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,680
who's taught about tunnels is nothing

930
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,839
like a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. tunnels Eric I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike</font>

931
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:14,290
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just heard about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one its IP /</font>

932
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,120
UDP came up this week but we're getting

933
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">better at creating them faster as far as</font>

934
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,069
I can tell but whether that's a good

935
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:23,440
thing or a bad thing yeah after you um I

936
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:25,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to capture sort of a</font>

937
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">paragraph saying this is the behavior we</font>

938
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,070
would want right and having that be

939
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:31,629
fairly condensed and then we can figure

940
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:32,480
out how to distribute it because some

941
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,280
other

942
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,850
when I saw the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X line on this back right</font>

943
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:40,430
so that's not a product of the idea and

944
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:43,549
it so that particular RFC is a bit

945
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,500
tricky right in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know we can</font>

946
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:48,170
have some other document that refers to

947
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,240
it saying if you doing the X client you

948
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,890
please do this and we'll make sure it

949
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,950
goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current set of envy or</font>

950
00:51:51,890 --> 00:52:02,200
three drafts the expand<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPE etc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jodi you</font>

951
00:51:54,950 --> 00:52:35,868
right GUI but but in the current one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

952
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:39,200
in between<font color="#E5E5E5"> would achieve that thought</font>

953
00:52:35,869 --> 00:52:42,710
process because the machine is putting a

954
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,169
PTP in a row IV editor but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

955
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:46,910
way around here us to say when they

956
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't hit or a lot of it or even if it's</font>

957
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:52,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">assuming between this is how you</font>

958
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">propagate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> emotion between and then three</font>

GBP or the egg zactly refer to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> firm</font>

960
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:00,740
yes and that well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my bcp</font>

961
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">versus PRS but to me that sounds like</font>

962
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:07,160
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is protocol behavior that we could</font>

963
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:10,730
standardize right and and and where you

964
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:15,140
apply it is a separate matter but yes so

965
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:16,400
Bob without prejudicing my options would

966
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,990
you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to write an internet</font>

967
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,060
draft which just catches this particular

968
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,009
bit of tunnel design thing as a separate

969
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,299
document and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we can figure out who</font>

970
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,430
should read this and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

971
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:27,800
capture it maybe some of it you're going

972
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:30,140
to the design team activity in the

973
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,520
routing area maybe it should be copied

974
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,350
maybe to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference maybe should be a</font>

975
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,150
separate document I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

976
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,410
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a separate piece</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of text to</font>

977
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,330
start with would be a really good thing

978
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:40,368
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we could we could add</font>

979
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,560
references to it from other places and

980
00:53:40,369 --> 00:53:44,210
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aware of it and if it's you</font>

981
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a page to read or whatever it</font>

982
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:49,670
should be easy yeah

983
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:51,530
most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're assuming that</font>

984
00:53:49,670 --> 00:54:01,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">our FC 64g applies to them and it just</font>

985
00:53:51,530 --> 00:54:06,890
clarifies if it does apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

986
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:10,549
steps so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will give you a response</font>

987
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:11,900
to the for the liaison and that will go

988
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:16,190
through the approval process presume

989
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:19,520
mission I think I we the co-authors will

990
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:22,490
help you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bash there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

991
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,020

992
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you draw</font>

993
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:28,310
first so pull it there the second one

994
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,259
I'll just have to drill for technique

995
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:33,529
and then I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that if we can get</font>

996
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,510
that shot up for a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

998
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:43,790
around enough isn't it we've got a few

999
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:46,160
reviews down a bit yeah yeah and I'm

1000
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:47,900
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether and how we know</font>

1001
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,970
we got to working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost coal status</font>

1002
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,710
when we're trying to inform people in

1003
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,169
other places about what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1004
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,460
mean if if we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advice was</font>

1005
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,170
being taken well and they were

1006
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,150
understanding it then that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">feel immediately jump to let's go for a</font>

1009
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,420
is a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unidirectional pipe</font>

1010
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,830
sometimes so and we can offer the advice

1011
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:11,750
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually require a response</font>

1012
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:17,330
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's it by bearing that in mind ask</font>

1013
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:18,620
again when you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edits and you</font>

1014
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,000
probably got any questions about the

1015
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:26,870
draft apart from what we've taken

1016
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:28,460
interactively the intention was<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1017
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:29,630
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing published so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1018
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:31,100
other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start designing</font>

1019
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:34,310
things in the way we thought they should

1020
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:37,250
be designed as in TS VW g this is advice

1021
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:40,040
to the community on how to use ecn in

1022
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,540
places where people might get it perhaps

1023
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,630
wrong if they didn't actually think

1024
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,610
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it carefully and my guess is</font>

1025
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,190
you've captured most of that so please

1026
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:50,750
read this draft we'd love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1027
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,750
comments on the list would look to see

1028
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:55,280
notes that you've read it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1029
00:55:53,750 --> 00:56:00,800
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us figure out whether we're after</font>

but for the various things you've no

1032
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:06,330
promised I'll make notes you'd have to

00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:24,089
new standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good 1.5 months second</font>

1036
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:27,990
right and went to the session end in

1037
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:34,340
four minutes so you have four minutes

1038
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:39,270
and you have a presentation this is

1039
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:43,170
bringing monetary ecca semantics for

1040

00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">twice standardization but what about</font>

1057
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:55,109
here is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to classify also who</font>

1058
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:58,410
can get it right here and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a type</font>

1066
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:28,760
explain the reasoning is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all recorded in</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> appendix have two other</font>

1068
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:35,330
possibilities were quickly discounted

1069
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:39,020
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we pick East e1 Percy</font>

1070
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:43,240
there's more green boxes and next yes

1071
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:46,820
dude we come on same<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minus</font>

1075
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:58,700
be the same now what would prefer to us

1076
00:58:57,050 --> 00:59:02,900
through here because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

1077
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,109
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> different by proposing a new you</font>

1078
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:10,160
know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite birthday 3168</font>

1079
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:14,930
proposing a new service and in fact in

1080
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,670
3168 it say we have decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make say</font>

1081
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:21,710
oasis of search<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

1082
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:26,660
differently such doc this is that 40

1083
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:30,730
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this may go even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying many</font>

1084
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">PCM look that good so what holy is</font>

1085
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:41,570
directly a stake in spray bottle<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

1086
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:45,640
but we will standardize the draw the if

1087
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:50,390
a package can be drawn with the square

1088
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:53,450
now the square and from the pack all the

1089
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:56,299
older<font color="#E5E5E5"> aquariums were designed around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

1090
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:59,540
square little wonder that square bombing

1091
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:03,050
in for the future we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

1092
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">square as where it and it gives you a</font>

1093
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:09,200
long-drawn whole system which is why

1094
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:13,100
we're at very low life so in order to

1095
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,460
feel this it's a no warm rock now we

1096
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:21,110
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for previous idea didn't get a</font>

1097
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:26,070
small so pop is an extra one love tsv WG

1098
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:31,290
should look up next slide yeah

1099
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:35,520
yeah so kinetic says what way choosing

1100
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:37,380
this will disallow preclude one thing

1101
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,640
years it would obsolete be easier nonten

1102
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,940
it says why because there's otherwise

1103
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,910
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we found now and also</font>

1104
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:49,370
there's very assertive in collusion with

1105
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:54,080
a potentially so now this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> poor to</font>

1106
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:55,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">kick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something and we'll be</font>

1107
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:58,319
discussing what would be the best thing

1108
01:00:55,980 --> 01:01:03,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do to there and we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1109
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:07,530
discussion right I'm finally not the sex

1110
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:09,509
life yeah more next steps I next<font color="#CCCCCC"> add</font>

1111
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:12,210
your next steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you yeah I'm not</font>

1112
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:16,490
yeah we can oh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anastasia so I'm gonna</font>

1113
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:19,410
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say hmm thanks at the moment</font>

1114
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:21,750
experimental but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're good cause</font>

1115
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:24,420
confusion so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a baby on the list</font>

1116
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:26,670
as to whether if we proposed standard um

1117
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,380
you know when i get review coming to

1118
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,640
please bear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can sell they</font>

1119
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list but that's</font>

1120
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,720
probably a bigger than thing to consider

1121
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:37,230
