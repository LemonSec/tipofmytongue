00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,350
the VAP ID but i'll do that again when

18
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,700
Martin is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present it so let's</font>

19
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:43,410
get into it on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone wants to</font>

20
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda yawn no okay uh-uh</font>

21
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:09,730
this is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay slide okay so just to</font>

22
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:14,049
cover what we've done since the last ITF

23
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,260
that we published<font color="#CCCCCC"> two drafts there was</font>

24
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,168
some discussion from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canon on a scenario</font>

25
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:23,169
related to subscription sets you may

26
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:26,950
recall that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the ability</font>

27
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the server to provide a subscription</font>

28
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:33,159
set and the server was making all the

29
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:36,610
decisions on to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aggregation of</font>

30
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,389
subscriptions the scenario from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canon</font>

31
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:43,240
was a proxy that was acting basically as

32
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:46,300
a user agent for a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

33
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,330
devices where it wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have control</font>

34
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,550
over how the the various subscriptions

35
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,250
were aggregated so basically have

36
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:59,910
different subscription sets so we made

37
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes to accommodate that in addition</font>

38
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:07,090
at the last IETF we talk about message

39
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,340
collapsing or message updates so

40
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you have an outstanding</font>

41
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,239
message that hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been delivered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,219
the user agent and now there is an

43
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,130
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that perhaps number of mail</font>

44
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,690
messages or something of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort now</font>

45
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,380
you can do another post to a particular

46
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,120
topic that that belonged to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and replace</font>

47
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:36,120
that message and basically delete it

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:36,120
that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been added for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 04 Martin</font>

49
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:48,120
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very sensitive for the 04 draft</font>

50
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:50,680
we had some feedback from Mozilla that

51
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,510
we had a default behavior where if there

52
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,630
was not a t-tail specified it would

53
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:58,510
default to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla was seeing many</font>

54
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,550
cases where that was unexpected to the

55
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,820
user agent and so messages were going

56
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,740
missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we made that required and</font>

57
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is no longer a default</font>

58
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,799
in addition we added pushed message

59
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,360
urgency which allows an application

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,340
server to indicate what it believes an

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,530
urgency<font color="#E5E5E5"> a message very low for example</font>

62
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,719
for an advertisement<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher for other</font>

63
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,169
messages then it also allows a user

64
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,240
agent to filter on that urgency to

65
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,880
basically say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to wake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

66
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,220
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an advertisement wake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for you</font>

67
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,250
know very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> message so we've</font>

68
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:42,560
added those capabilities we also had a

69
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:44,000
pending issue where along with an

70
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,040
acknowledgement returned by the user

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,720
agent there is a potential to return

72
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:53,350
some diagnostic data and for the lack of

73
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,730
any data around a particular scenario

74
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,080
we've gone ahead and closed it and the

75
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,180
pull request for the time being and how

76
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,099
interested people are in working on the

77
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,430
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have very</font>

78
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:10,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">many pending issues at this point</font>

79
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically three so there's the thunder</font>

80
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,940
and client authentication issue jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

81
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:20,539
which is potentially addressed by vapid

82
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:24,080
if adopted and Martin will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be talking</font>

83
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that in a bit I wanted to make</font>

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,380
some editorial changes to the security

85
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,810
considerations sections just have

86
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,360
informative references to both the

87
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,630
content encryption draft and if adopted

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,950
the authentication draft maybe include

89
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,810
some principles um again they're being

90
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,300
covered by Martin and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

91
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,890
there's the issue of simplifying

92
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,280
acknowledgments which has been discussed

93
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:52,780
on the mailing list and most of my

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,780
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be about that</font>

95
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:08,750
so today during the subscription for

96
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:12,320
messages the user agent gets back a

97
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:15,290
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of link relations one of those is</font>

98
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the push link relation which is used to</font>

99
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,640
buy the application server to send

100
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,120
messages through the push service to the

101
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,940
user agent the other is

102
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">receipt subscription the push colon</font>

103
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,830
receipts both of those need to be

104
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,200
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the application server</font>

105
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,890
the application server then uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

106
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:40,150
push receipts link relation to request a

107
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:44,860
subscription for receipts slide and the

108
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:48,910
new proposal we can basically yeah it's

109
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:57,100
great we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skip the rest of the</font>

110
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:59,380
slides no no I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kidding so in the</font>

111
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,300
new proposal the first step is we can

112
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,010
eliminate this bush receipts it doesn't

113
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:09,719
have to be returned it doesn't have to

114
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:09,720
be sent to the application server slide

115
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,150
so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the application server</font>

116
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,910
would get this receipts link relation

117
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,339
from the from its user agent and it

118
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,949
would then need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give me a</font>

119
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:30,339
receipt subscription from the push

120
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:37,930
service next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide don't need to do that</font>

121
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:39,400
anymore slide back so we can also cut

122
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,870
this behavior it's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer necessary</font>

123
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:46,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the application server to have to</font>

124
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:50,140
create a receipt<font color="#CCCCCC"> a request a</font>

125
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:54,959
subscription root of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two a receipt next</font>

126
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:57,040
slide so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note that if your</font>

127
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,140
your implementation doesn't care about

128
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,270
receipts at all nothing changes you'll

129
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,420
your application server will post<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

130
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,430
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know we'll get back a</font>

131
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,020
successful this message was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

132
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:14,290
here's your location of your message

133
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:17,230
resource if you are interested in

134
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:21,010
receipts today it's somewhat complicated

135
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:23,020
you first must monitor for receipts

136
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:25,990
using that receipt subscription that you

137
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:32,329
requested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the earlier stuff</font>

138
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:35,000
you will provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> your subscription in</font>

139
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,890
the post<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a message to indicate that</font>

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,360
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a receipt and that's</font>

141
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,650
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> acknowledgement should be</font>

142
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,780
returned to you'll get your 201 location

143
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,130
of your message and if you're monitoring

144
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,310
at some point you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to receive a</font>

145
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:52,430
receipt<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've agreed to a 204 and</font>

146
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,670
then a path to the original message that

147
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:01,939
was created by the and returned by the

148
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:05,479
push service<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide this is a little</font>

149
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,250
complicated so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now you don't start</font>

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:12,140
monitoring for receipts at the beginning

151
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:14,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go ahead and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push your message you</font>

152
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,760
eliminate having to pass in this receipt

153
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:21,320
and you indicate that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer that</font>

154
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server responds async you get back a</font>

155
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:29,420
202 that it's accepted the location of

156
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:32,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">the message and a params push receipt</font>

157
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,829
and that is being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically as a</font>

158
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,650
monitor you do it get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font>

159
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,940
you'll get your acknowledgement next

160
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:49,189
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes into a bit more detail so we</font>

161
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:53,900
need some way of indicating that we want

162
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get back a an acknowledgement there's</font>

163
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,340
already a prefer header for respond a

164
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,150
sink it seems like we could reuse this

165
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:08,240
and indicate that we're waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> then for</font>

166
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:11,390
a response next slide the expectation is

167
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,510
if you're using a 202 that you need to

168
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:18,910
provide a status monitor so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

169
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:21,350
can provide the receipt that was a

170
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,680
resource location that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was returned by</font>

171
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:27,840
the push service for us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to for</font>

172
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:33,189
updates on the status of this

173
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:35,340
next slide so when this was discussed on

174
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:42,520
the mailing list there were some

175
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:44,470
concerns about how many pending gets a

176
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:50,319
particular application server might have

177
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:51,970
to open to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these receipts so</font>

178
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,930
looking at it today the best case

179
00:12:51,970 --> 00:13:02,400
scenario is if a user agent gets back a

180
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:04,810
push resource from<font color="#E5E5E5"> its push service and</font>

181
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,420
distributes it to one application server

182
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,079
which i think is the default expectation

183
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:14,699
but it's not required could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hand it</font>

184
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,780
off to as many servers as it wants the

185
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:21,610
push service should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to return</font>

186
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:25,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same status monitor if you will the</font>

187
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:27,250
same receipt for message delivery

188
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,800
request from an application server to

189
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same push resource it should know</font>

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,550
that there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> relationship between the</font>

191
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,680
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those that would mean that the</font>

192
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,099
application server would<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor one</font>

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,620
resource for receipts from one

194
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,500
subscription from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user agent</font>

195
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:48,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best case</font>

196
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,160
implementation coming on sliding<font color="#CCCCCC"> million</font>

197
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,199
dollars every day ways there's been some

198
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,270
discussion and this will probably be

199
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,330
what we mainly want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

200
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:03,100
is whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not there should be some</font>

201
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:05,320
symmetry between the application server

202
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,910
and the push service with subscription

203
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,380
sets similar to what we have between the

204
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">user agent in the push service so</font>

205
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:18,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Martin's proposal was basically if there</font>

206
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:22,720
was some way that the application server

207
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:27,010
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlate what particular resource</font>

208
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:33,370
it wants to get back receipts on this

209
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:35,439
would be useful and more efficient so we

210
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:37,450
didn't discuss this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

211
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,089
mailing list but seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin is up</font>

212
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about it in more detail</font>

213
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:45,100
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns here is that you</font>

214
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:48,059
have an application server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

215
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,509
sends very large numbers of messages and

216
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:54,699
those messages each get their own

217
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,019
receipt thing to monitor which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

218
00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:57,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the application server if they're</font>

219
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,860
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> receipts for very large</font>

220
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:02,949
numbers of messages potentially have 4n

221
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,620
messages have to make n monitoring

222
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,258
requests and then get and one pushes on

223
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:11,920
an independent monitoring request which

224
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:13,990
i think is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds bad I</font>

225
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,180
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's quite true I don't</font>

226
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:21,519
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one per request I think it's</font>

227
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:23,949
one per subscription which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in</font>

228
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,920
the deterrent case will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 request</font>

229
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:29,498
and we see a lot of cases where

230
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,229
application server send one message to a

231
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:34,509
very large<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of people not multiple</font>

232
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,809
messages messages to the one person so

233
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,850
the only sort of correlation that you

234
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:42,339
would have is not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the same</font>

235
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,749
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the same subscription if</font>

236
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,120
you're selling multiple messages to the

237
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:50,230
same subscription which is the very

238
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,730
narrow definition in this space<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're an</font>

239
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,319
application server sends two lots and

240
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,839
lots of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially has</font>

241
00:15:53,319 --> 00:16:00,219
multiple subscriptions for individual

242
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,679
people and if my chance you happen to be

243
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,269
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages to the same instance of</font>

244
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:09,370
an application then that yes you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

245
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:11,740
reuse of your receipt subscription but

246
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,860
otherwise you would not and so having

247
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:18,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">some way to glom them together would be</font>

248
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:21,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think highly valuable I think there's</font>

249
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:23,620
an application server<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want maybe one</font>

250
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:26,050
receipt subscription / push service that

251
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,569
I might be interacting with that that's

252
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,849
a far more manageable and scalable

253
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:32,189
scenario or<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a handful purple at</font>

254
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,970
which service depending on how the

255
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:38,949
service is architected that would be

256
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:43,640
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cool with me as well</font>

257
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:45,920
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> tends rather than millions</font>

258
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,590
is the sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> fahima it also note</font>

259
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,729
that this issue done is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> created by</font>

260
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:54,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the simplification it's been something</font>

261
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is headed by the simplification in</font>

262
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sense that there was texting the</font>

263
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,130
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> document that would allow a</font>

264
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,959
push an application server to do this

265
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:13,700
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of aggregation it wasn't very good</font>

266
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you that much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joella ran from</font>

267
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the floor if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to let</font>

268
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,880
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> be up to the push server then it</font>

269
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:28,520
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand out the same URI</font>

270
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,560
multiple lines to you and then Martin

271
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,740
said if I knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was you it could</font>

272
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,120
also decide that it wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to split up</font>

273
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,130
your traffic a little bit and give you

274
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,050
different ones and if so if you already

275
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,720
had if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already listening on that</font>

276
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,730
you are I you keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if he gives</font>

277
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,270
you a new one you have to make a new

278
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:52,220
connection yeah the situation today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

279
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about authentication but we</font>

280
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,180
don't have required authentication and

281
00:17:53,900 --> 00:18:00,410
so the dependency is on some sort of

282
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,730
ambient information yeah so there's a

283
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,650
number of ways you can sliced this

284
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,790
particular one not until you aren't you

285
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,150
so there's a number of ways you can cut

286
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,010
this the push service could yes if it

287
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:15,110
has some way of identifying you because

288
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,940
maybe it's the same connection or maybe

289
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:21,679
it has some medication information<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

290
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,390
you volunteered or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fondle some</font>

291
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,610
lizard giblets or something like that

292
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:28,670
whatever it needs to do in order to get

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if mate could then decide to send</font>

294
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,250
you the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> your eye in responsible and</font>

295
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:37,699
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sad as a result of that</font>

296
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:41,630
because now you're getting receipts for

297
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,580
something over here where you actually

298
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,190
wanted them over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here because it's made</font>

299
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,770
some inference about what's going on on

300
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">your end</font>

301
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:54,730
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture of your application</font>

302
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,410
server that is incorrect so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

303
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your outbound request that to send</font>

304
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,010
the bush messages are all aggregated

305
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,090
through the one sender and then that

306
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,580
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end that's looking</font>

307
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,760
for the receipts and they post requests

308
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are need to be split up somewhere these</font>

309
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,700
are there's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple solution that</font>

310
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,550
I'm that I'm suggesting here which is

311
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,160
have the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> server suggest that</font>

312
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,780
you might want to use the existing

313
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,030
subscription that you gave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask time</font>

314
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:36,220
and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't provide that then you</font>

315
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:38,170
can provide it a new one but did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

316
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:44,140
have a slide on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but any more on</font>

317
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:45,550
this one this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> red yeah so so that</font>

318
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,190
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do subscription sets right</font>

319
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:51,340
now is that when you request a

320
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:54,280
subscription you say and by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

321
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,760
have this subscription set already if it

322
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:01,540
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense for you to do so please put</font>

323
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,070
the subscription in this set and you

324
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,230
would make the same request in this case

325
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh by the way I already</font>

326
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:13,020
have this receipt subscription set over

327
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">here if it's convenient for you use it</font>

328
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,950
you're suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we go in the post</font>

329
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:21,370
when the application server posts the

330
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,230
message and ask for a receipt say I've

331
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,459
already got one thanks if you want to

332
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,780
use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it would be really great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

333
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:30,070
they could do that thing and the

334
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,170
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> server would have to look</font>

335
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:33,129
for that being echoed back and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

336
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it could be</font>

337
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">different in some cases but basically</font>

338
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,170
you'd like it to mirror the language

339
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,940
that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> around subscription sets</font>

340
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:47,580
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user agent and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

341
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,580
might return exactly the same language

342
00:20:52,899 --> 00:21:08,149
any other comments questions ok then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

343
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:15,230
will create a pull request for this for

344
00:21:08,149 --> 00:21:17,090
review on the mailing list just a quick

345
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:23,240
question so this was with 2 a2 status

346
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:25,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">code or 201 this update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so in this</font>

347
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,289
case when it creates all when the

348
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,659
applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were sent to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the push</font>

349
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:32,149
server does it send will it get it 2 or

350
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:38,869
two back are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about the case</font>

351
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:42,258
for when it's requester receipt yeah but

352
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,509
his disposal this as a 202 when you

353
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:49,789
request a receipt and you provide the

354
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:55,220
status monitor then yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

355
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:56,990
fine yep I I think that's that that's a

356
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,149
detail that we that we missed and I

357
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,639
think when yes thank you for asking us

358
00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:04,610
to confirm that I think that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

359
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:08,178
idea you're also comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

360
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:11,539
prefer respond a sink then I don't

361
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:12,889
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you need</font>

362
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,200
to have some way of saying i want to

363
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:16,969
receive right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ronny to toss something</font>

364
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,470
right and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's again that's</font>

365
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,820
that's a good good way of dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

366
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,769
that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep that fits and we don't</font>

367
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to define any actual mechanisms for</font>

368
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:27,710
that to work we just go this is this

369
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,090
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there on this thing over</font>

370
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and we're just like glue them</font>

371
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:40,428
together yeah actually um so how do you

372
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:44,268
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is almost ready you guys</font>

373
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:47,899
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok like we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know is if you get</font>

374
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so um can I just see a hand</font>

375
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:53,709
of how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have actually read</font>

376
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,179
the most recent draft ok and how

377
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:59,019
confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you that this is ready to</font>

378
00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:00,280
go to law school after we get this

379
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:03,970
reflected what

380
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,680
what we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

381
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,590
uncomfortable with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of the</font>

382
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,020
draft at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment can you spare the</font>

383
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,750
mic and tell us what is making you

384
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:22,840
uncomfortable sure Patrick<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's keep</font>

385
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:24,940
receipt Patrick Olinsky Francisco um I I

386
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,409
liked everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I liked pretty much</font>

387
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,880
everything in the new in the new draft

388
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,970
that which I've read that I haven't read

389
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,730
hundreds anivia but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

390
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:38,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be looking at a closer into how</font>

391
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:40,150
we can use urgency for a couple of

392
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,649
additional semantics in particular

393
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,850
around prioritization and potentially

394
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">around some of the subscription stuff</font>

395
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,860
his as Martin was bringing up around

396
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,950
subscriptions and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guiding the</font>

397
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,469
the server to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the description</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

398
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,550
right server prioritization again is

399
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,930
something where you might want to have a

400
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:06,520
different pool handling high priority

401
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:09,250
stuff versus love modern asks if we can

402
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,840
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this later we talked about</font>

403
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,230
this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past and this is an</font>

404
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,209
interesting topic to discuss I'm happy

405
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,980
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it's just one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

406
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're already in the draft</font>

407
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,310
rather than saying yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all the</font>

408
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:22,780
people about it and attribute

409
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,760
interesting discussion to have so if we

410
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,399
have a time like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever like chairs</font>

411
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,629
so let's parking lot that it through the

412
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,400
agenda that we've got and then come back

413
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:31,840
and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today if you still have</font>

414
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:42,550
time which I hope we will that sounds

415
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:44,020
great are there I hope there's a couple

416
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,490
of other people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the room who</font>

417
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,580
are planning to read it as a part of

418
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,660
last call can I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> some hands on that</font>

419
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,590
thank you you were the one I was looking

420
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:57,660
at in particular just the record to show

421
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,520
is plenty of Brian Trammell thanks rod

422
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:02,620
so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went looking for images and</font>

423
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,910
it turns out that you get lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

424
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:11,290
pictures of trucks when you search for

425
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:12,999
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um it um this is this is</font>

426
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:16,329
the model of car

427
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:25,839
that is dominant in Grand Theft Auto

428
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:28,869
apparently so they have it next so we

429
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:31,119
have this request that push servers were

430
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:34,958
unhappy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation that they</font>

431
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:36,849
weren't able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do anything at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all to</font>

432
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:39,699
identify the application servers in some

433
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:42,609
sort of standard way and so this draft

434
00:25:39,699 --> 00:25:45,909
does it basically puts a very minimalist

then if they want to they can put their

that application and the push service

a fairly wide reassignment drown I'm

wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether and we think that</font>

want to have differently normal behavior

00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,530
those are cellular from the rush service

514
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,990
is actually lying about storing that

message and to the outside world no one

516
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,870
has any weather knowing but thinking

currently that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't ice actually</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too but</font>

521
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:37,870
but there will be cases wait yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

522
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,850
i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to provide a hook for that</font>

523
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:42,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's just going to be a crew</font>

525
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,970
this it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunate if we wrote</font>

526
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,100
this back in such way that the rejection

527
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,679
is mandatory it's currently mandatory

528
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be useful to allow</font>

00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect to allow that behavior so</font>

530
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,480
that you're not out of specs if you're

531
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:00,090
dropping yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might be</font>

532
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:09,429
something we can push into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

533
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">documentary with this one so I think in</font>

534
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:12,309
general we want to be we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

535
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,918
that choice available to the push

536
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:19,090
service because if someone's acting

537
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:24,700
badly then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just okay thanks got</font>

538
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:28,000
your message so don't talk on camera

539
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:30,220
labs so I read thru drive can I just

540
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,080
like question how does it work in the

541
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,080
context of a message subscription I

542
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,449
wasn't able to follow that part so let's

543
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,899
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a model that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have is white our</font>

544
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,669
user region might just question roblem

545
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,580
that running at the time you cannot even

546
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:48,669
have a crucial in applications all give

547
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to because so so typically is that</font>

548
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,200
you could you look at the other context

549
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:56,169
of the web RTC and other I money think

550
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,480
if I w3c IP I for example later to<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

551
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:00,760
lightly night for um if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

552
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,470
there in there in I projects the

553
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,629
application requests the creation of a

554
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">subscription so the request from the</font>

555
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,440
application triggers the pressure was

diversion I think we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have merged</font>

559
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,200
already is when the application requests

00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:20,709
the creation of the solution they say

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,590
the entire world will require the use of

578
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,139
this or it will be optional for the

579
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire world but currently it's mostly</font>

580
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:10,639
voluntary so the pricing service that

581
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,259
when web deloitte device is voluntary

582
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:15,209
other service will require it so as a

583
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:17,759
practical matter but maybe they don't we

584
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">think alike but application so the</font>

585
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,399
repetitiveness you don't forget out of

00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably are not then simply because a</font>

588
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:34,830
i see i think that's okay but it's not

589
00:32:30,529 --> 00:32:36,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not something I'm proud of if</font>

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:40,470
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any ideas on how we can</font>

591
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:43,830
address that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear them but I</font>

00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't expect anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and we</font>

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,210

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,799
had some discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that</font>

00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:54,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the voluntary contact information</font>

is as home to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali unauthenticated things</font>

599
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,019
I can provide Joe's email address in the

600
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,500
token and the push service will probably

601
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:09,210
happily accept that until such time as

602
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Costin is looking at that the number of</font>

you sending so many messages and Joe

606
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,840
goes or it lands in Joe's spam bucket or

607
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,178
something like that and disappears so um

608
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,889
they're like oh this perfectly

609
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:31,440
acceptable we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything all right</font>

we're talking about is the public we

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,639
could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone a little bit slower and</font>

that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that we want to hang</font>

616
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:45,840
was actually Joe who was making all

617
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,120
these requests any response you get some

618
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,549
sort of verification that it is Joe

619
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,799
that's involved you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can mark your</font>

disable equation basis

624
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:03,780
but you wouldn't want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

625
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,580
decisions based on the fact that these

00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:10,040
these contact details have been provided

627
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:15,870
or not if it says that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

628
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,820
don't believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's Facebook Joe</font>

629
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:21,210
Hildebrand from the floor is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

630
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,580
place where I could set up mine with a

631
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,340
policy that says I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send you</font>

632
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,960
an email and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to click on the</font>

633
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:32,970
link i send you before i'm going to

634
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:35,909
start processing I imagine that what's

635
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,049
more likely to be the case there because

636
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not going to be</font>

completely automated on some server that

638
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,960
is going to receive the responses from

639
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:49,080
the push service and just play oh look

640
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,510
at that too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I too great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> proceed it's not</font>

641
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have any way to feed that</font>

642

motion back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person that wrote the</font>

643
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,589
code or the person that I would put that

644
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:01,860
that string in there but what might

645
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen there is that in in some</font>

646
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:08,280
circumstances the push service might

647
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:13,560
gate greater access to capacity or

648
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:15,450
features or something or other on being

649

<font color="#E5E5E5">able to contact someone and say look</font>

see is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being useful more than anything</font>

else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most important use</font>

659
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,560
for it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of a sudden your your</font>

660
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,529
particular application server has gone

661
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,290
from standing I don't know a thousand

662
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:53,340
messages an hour to a thousand messages

663
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,960
a second what the hell we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

664
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,740
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> you off if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't respond in 15</font>

665
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,320
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking as an admin I</font>

666
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,209
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that seems like it might</font>

667
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,740
be information like nope is probably I'm

668
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,900
under attack or something else has gone

669
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,370
horribly wrong that's right darter

670
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">videos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well this is why you volunteer</font>

671
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,350
this information

672
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:13,750
right and at which point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind if</font>

673
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,960
you validate it early in the process I

674
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,030
guess yeah so the the implication here

675
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,580
is that it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be validated at any</font>

676
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,600
time by the by the push so i think i

677
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,940
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quite we don't have any</font>

678
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,950
mechanisms for doing so what imagine nor

679
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,750
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we necessarily need to as</font>

680
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,810
long as you've got an appropriate error

681
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:34,480
for policy violations or that kind of

682
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,680
thing so as as long as you keep that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

683
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,000
mind we're just gonna we're just gonna

684
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:45,069
pretend the message went through<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't</font>

685
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:49,000
we it's fine yeah I think that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

686
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:56,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that one we have the question</font>

687
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:59,440

717
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:41,329
say so on the mailing list yet I don't

718
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">see any extra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hands there's one extra</font>

719
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:44,960
hand up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I'd say let's say that</font>

720
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:47,960
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list then if you wouldn't mind</font>

721
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,250
that would be really helpful so you want

722
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:57,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just go over the egg content yeah yes</font>

723
00:38:52,250 --> 00:39:00,799
so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to wasn't expecting</font>

724
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:03,589
spanners in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting so we had</font>

725
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:07,099
discussion about the encrypted content

726
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:10,040
encoding stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Decker observed that</font>

727
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:12,829
if we're going to do signing for other

728
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,230
reasons in HTTP and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

729
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:17,210
encryption there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

730
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:19,549
interesting interactions between signing

731
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:24,770
and encryption that need to be very

732
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:26,630
carefully considered basically the basic

733
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:28,490
problem is that you can't do signing and

734
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,690
encryption as two separate steps and

735
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:35,000
expect the overall thing to be safe

736
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,430
because you depending on which order

737
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,200
they're applied in one or other can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

738
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:40,279
removed to replace both by something

739
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,868
else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this there's a bunch of</font>

740
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,160
research on this and how you manage it I

741
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:50,260
haven't thought through all the

742
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,730
implications of that but it will likely

743
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:55,400
delay the content<font color="#CCCCCC"> in coding stuff until</font>

744
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:57,470
such time as we've reassured ourselves

745
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,240
that there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

746
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:03,589
have sufficient mechanisms in place to

747
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,299
deal with that that's now going to be

748
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:08,270
the only thing that's stopping us from

749
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:11,480
shipping documents I imagine given the

750
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:14,540
status of the the protocol draft which

751
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:17,930
is basically a handful of pull requests

752
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:21,560
away from being done from what I from

753
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:25,790
Brian's presentation and I have nothing

754
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,009
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do on the web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> push side of this stuff</font>

755
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">because all i did was updated recently</font>

756
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:33,950
to the changes that were but we're in

757
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:38,900
there so update the references so that

758
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:40,700
that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's at we're running on</font>

759
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,700

761
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:50,990
unless anyone feels that they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

762
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:56,390
see an RFC number sooner<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather than</font>

763
00:40:50,990 --> 00:41:00,049
later but I don't know how to play this

764
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:01,580
one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's just there's</font>

765
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,490
problems and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> neda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

767
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:12,490
individual um how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plan to work</font>

768
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:15,800
through the the encryption signature

769
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:18,709
issue there's certainly a lot of

770
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,300
expertise including<font color="#E5E5E5"> Becker and a few of</font>

771
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,410
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us that you could drop on</font>

772
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:26,690
well that the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is</font>

773
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:30,080
understanding that the the nature of the

774
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and the available options for</font>

775
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,500
solving it so the basic the basic

776
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,359
techniques for solving in a well

777
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:40,180
understood and is not particularly

778
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:44,810
difficult to address the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is</font>

779
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:50,690
understanding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application to http in</font>

780
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:52,009
the way that it's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used and what we</font>

781
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,450
have at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment is a bunch of generic</font>

782
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,839
tools can be applied in any number of

783
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,669
ways which makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult to</font>

784
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,170
understand it in context and so what

785
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,530
we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do most likely is</font>

786
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,570
is change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of the tools that</font>

787
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,390
we're providing in order to more

788
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,820
narrowly define the problems that can be

789
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:12,650
solved and therefore

790
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,340
showing the problem in a way that can we

791
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:20,540
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually solve it that makes it</font>

792
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:22,640
difficult I think but given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font>

793
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,580
only thought about this in my jet lag

794
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,870
state for about 30 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm not</font>

795
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,819
going to commit to anything in

796
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,790
particular at this point but I know all

797
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:37,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who do this stuff and will</font>

798
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:37,060
when I had to deal with its work through

799
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:54,710
anything about this no yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Seymour</font>

800
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:57,050
anymore so when we adopt this adopted

801
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,540
this continent coding draft you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

802
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,980
was the idea was<font color="#CCCCCC"> to progress the quad</font>

803
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">raft and the continent coding draft</font>

804
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,360
together into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end submitted to a SG</font>

805
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,340
at the same time or you know making a

806
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,320
diversity at the same time but we don't

807
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:11,570
really I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless you know it's not</font>

808
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,730
if we can still progress the quad draft

809
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,260
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we</font>

810
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,660
want to do with the continent coding job

811
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,030
depend on the status of the HTTPS draft

812
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:23,210
yeah so the uncomfortable part there is

813
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:25,700
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a dependency on the</font>

814
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,770
problem being solved it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

815
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,509
have a dependency on the draft that has

816
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:34,430
a dependency on having a problem solved

817
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:36,920
so yeah I like i said before i'm not i'm

818
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:39,799
not particularly fast about timing

819
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,170
unless other people want to push push

820
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,750
push on this one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we can</font>

821
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:50,350
afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let that one take its time and</font>

822
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:52,850
it may just be that it requires a week

823
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:55,580
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sit down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a meeting</font>

824
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:59,150
work work through the thing work out

825
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:01,790
what the what sort of constraints we can

826
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,490
put on the problem space and write some

827
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:07,600
text it may be that simple or it may be

828
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,799
that we have to have to look at the

829
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">interplay of content encodings and</font>

830
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,670
there's some weird new content<font color="#E5E5E5"> encoding</font>

831
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,100
that did you use that is the combination

832
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:22,100
of encryption and signing so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

833
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:24,348
gonna sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with echo and all of them</font>

834
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,910
and then try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

835
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:28,279
take the responsibility for solving the

836
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:31,700
problem however damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my name's on</font>

837
00:44:28,279 --> 00:44:33,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">all all the involved rafts I'm motivated</font>

838
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:37,939
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the problem goes away</font>

839
00:44:33,729 --> 00:44:44,868
however it needs to go away hey great

840
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:51,279
okay Oh Pasha gonna talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

841
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:54,109
priorities Patrick<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's agree Francisco</font>

842
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:59,019
yes of the prioritization the the the

843
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:01,630
urgency field today is like

844
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">tantalizingly close to it to a to a</font>

845
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:09,319
message priority indicator and it would

846
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,049
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> great to look at how we can allow how</font>

847
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:14,210
we can use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you talk about</font>

848
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:16,579
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things earlier you</font>

849
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,349
know a delivery not<font color="#E5E5E5"> waking up the radio</font>

850
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:20,450
etc but I think there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

851
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:26,769
other dimensions that that's very useful

852
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:28,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at as well so reordering of</font>

853
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:35,930
items so that high priority things come

854
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:38,058
first on a reconnect routing differently

855
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,519
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example high priority items going</font>

856
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:42,219
to different set of servers potentially

857
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:46,279
be a some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of subscription metadata</font>

858
00:45:42,219 --> 00:45:51,650
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quality of service</font>

859
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:54,739
guarantees or not guarantees but the

860
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:57,829
targets based on what those those those

861
00:45:54,739 --> 00:46:00,019
priorities are I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

862
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:02,539
really nice to figure out like I don't

863
00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:03,859
want like delay getting something<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

864
00:46:02,539 --> 00:46:06,410
there by the other hand I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

865
00:46:03,859 --> 00:46:08,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really nice to figure out at</font>

866
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:10,578
least one hour like what's a list of the

867
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:12,829
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would want to do with</font>

868
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:15,259
prioritization like next and make sure

869
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:17,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defining urgency in such</font>

870
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:19,849
a way that like you know six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

871
00:46:17,539 --> 00:46:21,430
now we're like oh crap that not going to

872
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:24,890
work we're gonna have to add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new field</font>

873
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,868
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's my main but my main</font>

874
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:30,440
concern there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit of a sanity check</font>

875
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:31,999
and like some brains coming around what

876
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,769
are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we think would</font>

877
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:35,269
be good to use prioritization with what

878
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:36,799
are the things we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be not</font>

879
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:37,660
only good to use prioritization for but

880
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:41,650
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

881
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:44,288
beneficial to be specifying and how does

882
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:52,569
that dovetail with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ergency</font>

883
00:46:44,289 --> 00:47:00,640
stuff so that's my concern do you think

884
00:46:52,569 --> 00:47:03,130
we need more granularity um I don't

885
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:07,839
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we necessarily need more</font>

886
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:12,700
granularity um<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it like I haven't</font>

887
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:14,200
thought fully through how to project the

888
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,390
way we do prioritization internally

889
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,520
within some of our applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on</font>

890
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,288
two dimensions and I haven't totally

891
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:23,650
thought through how to project those two

892
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:27,309
dimensions on to one value so there's a

893
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:31,210
separation between<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the the source</font>

894
00:47:27,309 --> 00:47:33,130
of a message and the the priority of

895
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,380
that message and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably</font>

896
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,079
mapped really nicely into different

897
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,640
subscription classes but I I don't think

898
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:42,670
we're missing granularity I'm more

899
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,589
concerned that like of the surprise so I

900
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,140
feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very worthwhile to</font>

901
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:49,808
go through the the exercise to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

902
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,538
degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of validating that we're not that</font>

903
00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:54,880
we're not paying ourselves into a corner

904
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:56,619
more than anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else so the draft</font>

905
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,559
currently says that the options are very

906
00:47:56,619 --> 00:48:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">low low normal and high yep so for</font>

907
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">example if you were to open up that list</font>

908
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,440
you'd have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rank them in</font>

909
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,779
some sort of order or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could turn it</font>

910
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,670
into a float which would be oh you'd

911
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:13,960
have as much granularity as you want and

912
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,559
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a variety of other problems</font>

913
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:20,260
at that point yeah so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I'm more</font>

914
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,250
interested in the granularity I'm more

915
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,049
interested in questions around the

916
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:26,529
interactions of like subscriptions and

917
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">prep and and urgency for example so</font>

918
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:36,660
mechanisms for a application server to

919
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:40,029
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convey the the fact that a</font>

920
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:44,680
after a day a low priority message can

921
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:48,460
just get dropped which which it can

922
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:50,220
which like we have a TCL but there's

923
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,619
like a cam and let there

924
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,270
there's this fuzzy barrier between like

925
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:56,280
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care if you drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like</font>

926
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,540
the like drop these ones first kind of

927
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,310
like so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a bunch of high</font>

928
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,750
priority stuff coming in then like I'd

929
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:02,130
rather you make the experience really

930
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,320
great for the high priority stuff and

931
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:05,790
the TTL I'd like it if you had if you

932
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">could deliver this within this TTL but</font>

933
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,690
but you don't necessarily need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font>

934
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,520
those are those sorts of interplay

935
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,599
between the features are what I'm

936
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,090
concerned about more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

937
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:16,650
granularity of the feature itself what

938
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,030
is like because those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sorts of</font>

939
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:20,010
questions we're going to be asking

940
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves in the year here or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in 18</font>

941
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:25,310
months once we have some rollout and I'm

942
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:32,790
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the those features</font>

943
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:34,799
putting us in a bind do you have a

944
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:38,340
proposal for how to go about doing that

945
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:43,010
analysis um I'd say in terms of going

946
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:48,270
out about doing the analysis you know

947
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:52,530
I'd love to get together you know to

948
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:53,790
influence and to consumers and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

949
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,349
write down what are what are the one of

950
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,050
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do prioritization for</font>

951
00:49:55,349 --> 00:50:01,170
today how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you like to go to do</font>

952
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:06,060
prioritization think we need to hold up

953
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:07,339
last call for that yeah can you get it

954
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,779
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we go to last call I guess</font>

955
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah um if that's gonna happen</font>

956
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:20,520
relatively soon before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin yeah um I</font>

957
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:21,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I if if we</font>

958
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,869
can find I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the right</font>

959
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,460
people to to execute on that because I

960
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:29,070
one who<font color="#CCCCCC"> cares about that is probably in</font>

961
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,200
the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now so who I guess that's</font>

962
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,640
a better way of asking this is who who

963
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,250
cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this who cares about</font>

964
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:45,270
prioritization integration into other

965
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:49,349
parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right so</font>

966
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:53,609
there's there's three half raised for

967
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:55,980
half raised hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so if you can</font>

968
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:58,440
get with them and make some progress on

969
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,420
this quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd say great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

970
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:01,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying enough other people</font>

971
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,670
jump up and down and say this is

972
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,130
massively

973
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:07,590
ortant that we necessarily ought to hold

974
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:09,690
up the group yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just I</font>

975
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">really don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hold things up good</font>

976
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:13,710
I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also figure out how to do</font>

977
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:19,980
this in parallel so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

978
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:21,510
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we regret so um one of the one</font>

979
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the results of such a discussion</font>

980
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,640
could be that well we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it</font>

981
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:28,370
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ideal we need to work on some</font>

982
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,140
other things what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do them later</font>

983
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:33,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a great outcome in my</font>

984
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,150
opinion but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

985
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:40,830
haven't painted ourselves into a corner

986
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:42,660
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I am i my my analysis that I've</font>

987
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:45,630
done privately without the benefit of

988
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:49,080
Patrick's perspective is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

989
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:52,710
can do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want</font>

990
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:55,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do or likely what to do because I'm</font>

991
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:58,770
guessing based on what you told me

992
00:51:55,070 --> 00:52:02,760
without materially changing what we have

993
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,930
currently however there may be some

994
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,460
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

995
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know i don't understand very well</font>

996
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:15,600
and so we have that conversation Alyssa

997
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,040
Cooper it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> also imply that other</font>

998
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,390
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> review this</font>

999
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,520
again one more time think about

1000
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,750
extensibility and how how the draft

1001
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,910
deals with extensibility because that

00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,050
might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice way around this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1003
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,549
as long as people feel comfortable that

1004
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:31,260
you I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now they are just a</font>

1005
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:34,410
mechanism doesn't is not extensible

1006
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,390
right but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be fine but just</font>

1007
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:38,850
generally thinking about the points

1008
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,259
where extensibility might help then if

1009
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:42,000
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> more comfortable that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1010
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,260
future this isn't boxing you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1011
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,810
corner I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a fantastic</font>

1012
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:48,000
suggestion so for example being able to

1013
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:49,440
determine what extensions are currently

1014
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,450
deployed on this server that kind of

1015
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,030
thing I mean we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a variety</font>

1016
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:56,430
of other protocols in the past it's been

1017
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:59,070
really useful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these kinds</font>

1018
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:06,020
of things it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice to not have</font>

1019
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:06,020
to do eh ello just to add options later

1020
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:26,788
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know which are</font>

1021
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,030
I

1022
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,640
you
