within a working group that sort of

review the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that comes out of the</font>

00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,140
review things that come out of the

118
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,330
security area to be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a</font>

one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the disadvantages of the</font>

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,990
a broad thing working group is a peep

those things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they air the second</font>

level review<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have in the area</font>

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,700
in general so that's what I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

136
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the iesg does all of this stuff they are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're they're the people there the</font>

group that's responsible and for the for

141
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,550
creating working groups and for tearing

down<font color="#E5E5E5"> working groups when their job is</font>

143
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:03,470
done so the work in the ITF is in

on some problem the formal work though

is done in working groups and the

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,410
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group activity is to create</font>

153

documents which are then reviewed by the

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,880
to that in a few minutes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then</font>

as only I only see one tie and that's

right over there this ties ladies

197

they are at let's say they're overly

and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it's difficult it doesn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">something about that we've tried in the</font>

of the amount if you run into trouble if

some of them with with with real cause I

228
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,640
mean that they're there<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're blunt</font>

229
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,530
because they see silliness and they want

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to correct it but that's not the right</font>

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,510
feature we have our own culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:51,740
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> around for a long time so I've got</font>

change<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're here you've got to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to succeed in this organization you have</font>

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,060
that's you're going to find that

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pleasant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not that's really not the</font>

243
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,030
things get done if you go to any

standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU or</font>

245
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">at Etsy or I so you have to adopt to</font>

246
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,570
their culture so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing special</font>

247
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,140
about the fact you have to adopt here

248
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:24,290
but it is worse than some areas because

249
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,090
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite as formal and that in</font>

250
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,880
formality means that people can get

251
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,860
insulted when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be either</font>

either end they shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

253
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,440
who doing the insulting shouldn't be

254
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,470
insulting in the person who was

255
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,650
receiving it shouldn't be insulted but

256
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,180
we do try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the best we can but if</font>

257
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:47,990
you do run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into trouble please let us</font>

258
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:50,089
know sort of the first step in many the

<font color="#CCCCCC">third very first step in many technology</font>

260
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:55,700
which wind up to being our RFC is an

261
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,430
internet draft an individual publishes

262
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,750
an internet draft you've got this great

263
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,780
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,060
marvelous pinochle playing protocol and

265
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,300
so you read an internet draft about that

266
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,770
and you publish that internet draft and

267
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">you get rally people around who like</font>

268

pinochle and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it</font>

269
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,250
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get enough people that you</font>

great protocol I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be a</font>

standard and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area director</font>

274

will say great it's perfect stuff that's

<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what we need to be doing we've</font>

a working group but more often the area

whether this interest in the community

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way they do that is to create a</font>

283
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,780
birds of a feather session that's an

284
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">ad-hoc session usually held only once</font>

285
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,839
per topic and that's a way for the area

286
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,490
director to gauge the level of interest

287
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">now birds of a feather sessions can also</font>

be for other purposes they could be just

for internet if they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> control it</font>

universally they said they wanted

predictability quality and service

300
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,260

to work the same way today as it did

was great that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not a birds of a</font>

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,530
ones that are going on this week are

310

ones that are designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see whether</font>

311
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,990
there's enough interest to develop to

312
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,060
create a working group I that then

313
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,010
during during that process the area

314
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,540

there's enough interest enough people

317
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,390
the ideas are crisp enough that they're

318
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,220
well enough directed it's not pure

319
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,939
research if it's pure research we kick

320
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,860
it over the corner to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I RTF IETF is</font>

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,340
can run and will use

323
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,540

stuff is done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the birds of a feather</font>

325
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,760
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do remember one case where I</font>

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,209
had a birds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a feather said big</font>

327
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,370
popular topic it was 300 or so people in

328
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty good-sized</font>

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end i got up as area director said</font>

331
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people think that</font>

332
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:37,160
this is ready to be a I ATF working

333
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,020
group and about half the people stuck up

334
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,969
their hands and you'll see that's

335
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,650
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty big number because</font>

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,320
most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> people just sit there</font>

337
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Guru and I don't say anything and</font>

338
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't stick up their hand they</font>

339
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,390
don't express an opinion they just sort

340
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,020
of sit there a lot of observers in this

341
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,790
community so I said okay that's that's

342
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,230
cool how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't think it</font>

343
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,780
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and the other has stuck up</font>

344
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,040
their hand so we had about everybody

345
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,740
expressed an opinion and they were

346
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,270
dimension diametrically opposed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

347
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,850
concluded from that it wasn't ready to

348
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,170
be a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group and it was it became</font>

349
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,270
a working group a number of years later

350
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that was the kind of thing that I</font>

351
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:17,480
figured out as an area director using a

352
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,650
birds of a feather session so working

353
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">groups are where the works done</font>

354
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:23,140
sometimes preceded by a Boff but

355
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,670
basically this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the work is done</font>

356
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,680
note that a working group you don't have

357
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,000
to come to an ietf me where he said this

358
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,459
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to an IA to have</font>

359
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,650
meeting to be part of working in fact

360
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,890
you will see the sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you go to</font>

361
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:40,250
this week are not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place where</font>

362
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do a lot of work yeah the IETF</font>

363
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,300
meeting we have this meeting they'll be

364
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,660
I have a list of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions there</font>

365
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,620
are there's not enough time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font>

366
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,150
to actually do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the actual work</font>

367
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,350
some standards bodies meet for two weeks

368
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,090
and they sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and they edit the</font>

369
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,130
document for two weeks in a particular

370
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,560
working group but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the way we</font>

371
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,180
work here they've got a session that

372
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be an hour and a half or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two hours</font>

373
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,050
and some of them are two and a half

374
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,240
hours that's all two and a half hour

375
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,099
session for a whole week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's for</font>

376
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work of the working group well you</font>

377
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,760
can't use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write the document you</font>

378
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,980
can't use it right the standard what you

379
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,990
use it for is to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

380
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,300
high-order bits what is what's a problem

381
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,220
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and resolve problems where the</font>

382
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,859
face-to-face communication is helpful to

383
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,350
do that but you don't write the actual

384
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,030
internet-drafts or the rfcs in a working

385
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:33,380
group meeting itself because it's not

386
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:35,750
enough time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that so the meetings</font>

387
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,420
themselves are very short as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already</font>

388
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,400
mentioned it's mostly bottoms up it's

389
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,620
you guys coming up with an idea and then

390
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,770
bring them bringing that forth rather

391
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:50,890
than the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> director or the IAB</font>

392
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:54,290
imposing an ID an area that idea a topic

393
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:56,810
working groups have charters a charter

394
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,640
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract having a contract with</font>

395
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,030
volunteer labor is somewhat pointless

396
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,350
but that's the idea so the contract says

397
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,120
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're going to work on</font>

398
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,580
here's what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

399
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,380
if you bring an idea to a working group

400
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,870
and it's not in their charter they're

401
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,760
not permitted to working on it they can

402
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,410
go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area director in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISU</font>

403
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,780
saying let's change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter to</font>

404
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,969
include this but you'll frequently hear

405
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,949
the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the working group</font>

406
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,320
chairs it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Charter we can't</font>

407
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,090
work on this because they trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

408
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,980
restrict the working group to working on

409
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,540
a particular set of topics so maybe

410
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,410
we'll get some work done rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

411
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:35,180
keep growing it in theory working groups

412
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,360
are closed when their jobs done in

413
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,010
practice sometimes they're not sometimes

414
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,810
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got some working groups</font>

415
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,390
that have been very long-lived because

416
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,969
they keep getting new topics to do but

417
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,949
unlike many standards bodies where if

418
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,240
you get your<font color="#CCCCCC"> work done in a working</font>

419
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,070
group you're given more work by

420
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,130
definition because you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

421
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,420
successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF most of the time the</font>

422
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,550
working groups are closed when their

423
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,050
jobs done which can be quite a shock to

424
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,660
somebody coming from one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

425
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,300

just work on the high-order issues so if

to working<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups you go to a working</font>

482
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,620
group and there's a bunch of discussion

483
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">about particular topics if you know</font>

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,239
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and you have read</font>

microphone and talk tell them what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

487
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,679
think but conditionally you do it when

488
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,928
you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about</font>

489
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,700
there's an old saying of don't open your

490
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:42,910
mouth improve your a fool they let

491
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,830
people just guess so you want to be

492
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">careful about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but if you do know</font>

493
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,570
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about then</font>

494
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:52,000
definitely do stand up and talk these

495
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,679
sessions are live stream

496
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,290
well and they're recorded for future

497
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,450
their audio stream and and video street

498
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,360
because cameras right here there's a

499
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,510
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different cameras around there</font>

500
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,840
live streamed all over the world so when

501
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:10,450
you go to the microphone you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

502
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,590
to the world through that microphone so

503
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:18,720
like the microphone don't do it down

504
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,669
here don't dare talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the microphone</font>

505
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,800
pretend to like the microphone look

506
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,450
directly at the microphone if the person

507
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,919
over here asked you the question don't

508
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,290
look at them look at the microphone

509
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,270
because the people out there an audio

510
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,850
land can't hear you unless you're

511
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,920
talking into the microphone and second

512
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,260
because it's also audio stream not just

513
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,840
video streamed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because there's</font>

514
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,210
somebody taking notes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we say who you</font>

515
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,959
are you walk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the microphone you say</font>

516
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,150
you know it's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so Fred Smith Scott</font>

517
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bratton or whatever you don't say who</font>

518
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,730
you're from because that's irrelevant

519
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,919
but you say is my name and then I go off

520
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,020
and have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion whatever I want to</font>

521
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,910
say you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time even</font>

522
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,280
though you were there three seconds

523
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,290
before because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person taking the</font>

524
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">notes may not is not looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

525
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,370
the people on audio won't necessarily

526
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,720
recognize your voice so every time you

527
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:15,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to the microphone say who you are you</font>

528
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,020
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> see blue sheets you don't have them</font>

529
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,430
in this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> session but you'll see what</font>

530
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,400
are called blue sheets in all sessions

531
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:24,040
and all other regular sessions and they

532
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,090
are a listing of who's attending this

533
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,990
meeting this is important for openness

534
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,879
whenever you're doing technical

535
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,830
technology standards you want to know

536
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,590
who was involved in the creation of the

537
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,110
standards that's it's a fact for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

538
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,179
types of standards organizations and the

539
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:42,520
way we do it is we you sign the blue

540
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,140
sheet now we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any police</font>

541
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,450
talent and watching you to be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

542
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,970
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> do sign it but please sign the</font>

543
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,140
blue sheet used to be that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had you</font>

544
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,140
sign it with your name and your email

545
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,230
address drop the email address because

546
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,760
that we couldn't just publish the blue

547
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,880
sheets with email address on it because

548
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,190
people use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with spam spam bait so we</font>

549
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,180
now change it so the blue sheets are

550
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,290
just have your name

551
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,350
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember me you have the</font>

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:10,550
organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think having organization</font>

553
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,399
they are scanned immediately and

554
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:15,800
published and then we destroy them but

555
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,930
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> record of who's participating in</font>

any electrical property reasons and just

558
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:26,540
for fairness in general we want to know

559
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:30,440
who's who's discussing these things this

560

week 133 sessions of which 119 are

are some working groups have more than

afternoon the posters for each of these

600
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,030
boss so look at the posters to see

601
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,690
whether you be interested in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

602
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,730
you are go to them find that it is

603
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:20,120
showing their future directions and then

604
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,030
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a special</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Boff from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">where we're going to go meeting wise not</font>

607
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,420
otherwise how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we decide to meet here</font>

608
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,979
versus someplace else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if you have</font>

609
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,590
input to that if you want different

<font color="#CCCCCC">have meetings there's a buff that we'll</font>

be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that if you're</font>

616
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:52,430
like and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be doing next</font>

617
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,710
these area open area meetings are a good

618
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:56,630
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure to find out so there</font>

619
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,550
there's a set of them this week there's

620
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,470
five of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

621
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely worth taking a look at them</font>

622
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:07,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they are looking at the cutting</font>

623
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,720
edge stuff in the area so at the

624
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,780
beginning I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had that quote from Dave</font>

625
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,110
Clark rough consensus and running code

626
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:18,440
well the IETF decided to do this to use

627
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:21,350
this concept of rough consensus it as

628
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,620
opposed to consensus which is in many

629
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:27,459
standards bodies consensus as Margaret

630
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,659
Thatcher once as famously to have said

631
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,420
consensus is where everybody is equally

632
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,480
dissatisfied well that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we</font>

633
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">do it we use rough consensus which means</font>

634
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,740
some people are very dissatisfied but

635
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,810
the rest are satisfied and that far

636
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:46,130
we're saying there is not everybody has

637
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:47,720
to agree if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a bee in your</font>

638
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,290
bonnet and you want this particular

639
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,850
result and nobody else cares and nobody

640
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,710
else really supports you we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

641
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,810
move on you might be upset or going to

642
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,770
move on we don't have to have everybody

643
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:03,020
in agreement that's a relatively easy

644
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:04,700
thing to do in a room in a meeting room

645
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,490
it's hard to do in a mailing list

646
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,800
understand what level of consensus there

647
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,480
is because they're mailing lists one guy

648
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,639
who types very well and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that a</font>

649
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,820
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra time can dominate the</font>

650
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:21,380
condition but in a room like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this how do</font>

651
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,689
we figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the consensus is well</font>

652
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,660
we do we do a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways one</font>

653
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:28,270
way we get derided for but let's try wit

654
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:32,180
so

655
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:34,670
show the show hands how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people took</font>

656
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:40,040
more than four hours to get to this

657
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:42,500
meeting and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people took less</font>

658
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,310
than four hours to get to this game some

659
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,890
people don't know how long it took so

660
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,889
the key rough consensus is it takes an

661
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,350
ietf meetings more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than four hours away</font>

662
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:56,360
no no I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> count I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at</font>

663
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">the general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> main Lucy how many people</font>

664
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,409
were saying one way or the other if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

665
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,960
see somebody counting in a meeting of

666
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,520
showing of hands then that's a mistake

667
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,110
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not what you're trying to</font>

668
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">find out you're trying to find out</font>

669
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:11,120
whether the part dominant view is one

670
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:15,590
thing or another now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens let's</font>

671
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,989
say that you work for Mike your opinion

672
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:20,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than Mike's if you put up</font>

673
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,750
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand when I say should we do this</font>

674
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,980
and Mike thinks you shouldn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

675
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,820
that's not me a good day back at the

676
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,130
farm so what do you do we have another

677
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,040
way of finding out the level of

678
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,470
consensus that's a home so let's try

679
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,850
this hum if it took you more than four

680
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:45,590
hours to get here hum if it took you for

681
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,179
less than four hours to get here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

682
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,590
now know what the consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but we</font>

683
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:52,340
don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he disagrees with his</font>

684
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:58,520
boss you'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those types of</font>

685
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:59,929
things he will see you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

686
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,200
happening a lot in these meetings the

687
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:05,540
idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the rough idea of how how</font>

688
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,220
much consensus there is if the hum

689
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,409
volumes are equal we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

690
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,420
consensus it's not time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on we</font>

691
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,620
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to discuss and trying</font>

692
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,620
to come up with the right solution

693
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:25,320
so I ATF documents all I ATF documents

694
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,790
are open they're open<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anybody as we</font>

695
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,860
can download<font color="#CCCCCC"> them you can print them out</font>

696
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:32,040
you can you can sell them and we've had

697
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,080
history where companies have downloaded

698
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,149
rfcs packaged up up under books and sell

699
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,590
them and that's fine we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

700
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,660
that's great but gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff out</font>

701
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:42,330
there it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that you couldn't if</font>

702
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are at a library you wanted a pretty</font>

703
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,230
book we didn't do printed books so the

704
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,950
fact that some companies did that was

705
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,900
great there's no in division at all we

706
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,080
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a blanket permission for</font>

707
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:56,760
anybody to translate any<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF document</font>

708
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,980
to another language without having to

709
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,610
get any permission at all it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

710
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,640
of the baked into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ruleset so you can</font>

711
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:08,370
you can do anything you want with it as

712
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,920
long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing in full you can't</font>

713
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,379
take a daikon<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF document modify it</font>

714
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,990
and then republish it as your document

715
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,220
you've got to take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in full and and</font>

716
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,559
say where you got it and things like

717
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:24,150
that I've mentioned internet-drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

718
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,300
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times internet-drafts instead</font>

719
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:30,390
of the first stage an internet draft is

720
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,000
some individuals ideas or could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

721
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:35,120
working groups ideas but it's there's no

722
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,710
admissions control on internet dress

723
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,870
anybody can publish it in a draft on any

724
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,370
topic and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

725
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,500
drafts director you can see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

726
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:47,159
admissions control there's some very

727
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,840
strange internet-drafts out there and we

728
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:51,420
have somebody solving<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fermat's theorem</font>

729
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,970
we've had other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got three</font>

730
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,710
bits with three values things like that

731
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,179
that shows up in internet-drafts and

732
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,460
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't april fools they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

733
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:03,120
soon as they were they were serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

734
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,830
anybody can do that most internet-drafts

735
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">have nothing to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the activities</font>

736
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:11,240
of the IETF in the sense that there's no

737
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,220
approval by the IETF for that no no a

738
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:15,179
statement that we're supporting

739
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,970
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interac stress</font>

740
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,470
internet-draft says this is something

741
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,390
also that news in the news people seem

742
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,309
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hard time with that they don't</font>

743
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:25,890
get the fact that you put in this

744
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,020
internet-draft and nobody cares but they

745
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,890
see it as the IETF is about to adopt

746
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,920
this proposal

747
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:34,590
well that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way it works but be</font>

748
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,280
that as it may and then we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

749
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">FCS RC is used to stand for a request</font>

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">for comment they don't anymore they stay</font>

751
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,990

752
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,030
be an RFC is too late to comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

753
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:50,730
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet draft you comment on</font>

754
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:52,800
so RFC's now are sort of a brand name

755
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:55,260
it's just this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our archival</font>

758
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:04,740
changes if we have a another RC that

759
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,450
replaces it it gets a new number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

way you find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's replaces you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">archival documents they never get</font>

764
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:21,449
changed the unlike the language of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF is English for a good or bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

English when you move obligations or it

00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,750
has been we're in the middle of changing

769
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:34,500
a little bit the way publications are

770
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:37,080
done up until now they've been asking

771
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">English so there's always had to be</font>

772
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,389
printable ASCII characters so many many

include their own name as an author

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't it doesn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">translate into plain ASCII accents or</font>

779
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:03,420
changed but still the primary document

780
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,300
is the ASCII English we can say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

781
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,790
can go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at RFC one and read</font>

790
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,850
got derision because you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">draw pictures and things like that</font>

792
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:33,959
because it's pure text you will see that

793
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,870
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pictures in rfcs it's called</font>

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,350
ascii art it's all using exclamation

795
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,879
points and diagonals diagonal lines and

796
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,399
up arrows and

797
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,970
nicol bars to draw pictures it is a

798
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,980
remarkably laborious thing to do and it

799
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:52,200
helps to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really good drugs it's</font>

800
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,480
just really hard stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,900
bunch of it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but now this</font>

802
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,870
revision is allowing more more pictures

803
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:04,230
it's allowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> postscript its PDF and</font>

804
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:06,659
it's allowing other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of formats but</font>

805
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,480
the canonical form the form which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

807
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,810
that's being done right at this moment

808
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:18,390
it's it's it's changing over the next

809
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:20,850
few weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it internet-drafts random</font>

810
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,680
thoughts things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that publish an</font>

811
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:24,810
internet draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't do anything</font>

812
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,580
about it you just publish it it'll be

813
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:29,370
removed from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main internet draft</font>

814
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,740
directory with after six months they're

815
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,570
not meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> permanent documents now</font>

816
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,190
it's moved into another another duck

817
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,860
another directory where it can be found

818
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google finds it things like that and</font>

819
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,379
it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in an archive which we can</font>

820
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,540
use but it's not seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary anymore</font>

821
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,390
so internet-drafts are moved to this

822
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,670
backup directory whenever they<font color="#E5E5E5"> time out</font>

823
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,620
or when they're replaced and they can be

824
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">replaced by an updated version for</font>

827
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:04,170
internet-drafts the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that is</font>

828
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,080
that the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet draft</font>

829
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:09,120
yet if you are submitting internet-draft

00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,969
you are agreeing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy abide by the</font>

00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:16,290
rights rules and process rules it says

00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,300
right at the top of the boil play at the

doing so by submitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have read participation rules</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific exemptions but</font>

842
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,210
internet-drafts have file names and

843
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,690
those file names are useful in figuring

844
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:49,080
out what the credit part of the pedigree

845
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:51,720
of the internet draft is if you if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

that she had not found ones that were

worthy of the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a few of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1001
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the series I published one called the</font>

00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:46,009
firewall enhancement protocol with a

<font color="#E5E5E5">student of mine and that's running</font>

1004
00:41:46,009 --> 00:41:54,470
tcp/ip over HTTP to get through those

1005
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:57,109
pesky firewalls because it's and the you

1006
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,118
know what you've got it right when first

1007
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:01,160
of all people yell<font color="#CCCCCC"> at you the firewall</font>

1008
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,990
people yelled at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what for doing</font>

1009
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,999
something to make the firewalls less

1010
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:08,569
useful and you get requests for

1011
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:10,129
implementations and so about half the

1012
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:12,410
mail I got was for implementations it

1013
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,990
has been implemented and it works very

1014
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,578
well but actually the particular

1015
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,899
implementation isn't great but and then

1016
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:19,480
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one which was the</font>

1019
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:27,799
was because we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> senator in the US</font>

it for illicit music sharing your

00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,410
personal computer he would come and

1024
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,880
destroy your computer and when asked did

1025
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,129
he really mean destroyed he said yes he

music is on that machine because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of for</font>

1030
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,599
some bad purpose it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1031
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,669
purchased it someplace so I described an

00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,349
omniscience protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you would</font>

1034
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,900
was ok so the requirements for an

1035
00:42:56,509 --> 00:43:01,279
omniscient protocol and I got well and

1036
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,130
truly trash for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is exactly</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted people thought I was in</font>

to destroy people's computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

1040
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,180
was that was exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you should</font>

somebody is collectible into a book got

1046

a couple of people to write

question you to do that we used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1050
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">a three-step standards process and I put</font>

1051
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,759
this slide in to remind you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

1052
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,369
not have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process in case</font>

1053
00:43:34,759 --> 00:43:39,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had heard that we really have two</font>

1054
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:42,950
different types of standards track

1055
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,680
processes one is a one-step standards

1056
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,828
process called the best

1057
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,200
practice or bcp that's mostly used for

1058
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:52,809
processed documents such as the ietf

1059
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,868
standards process itself but it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1060
00:43:52,809 --> 00:44:00,309
used for how to allocate values in

1061
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:03,190
protocols and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ways</font>

1062
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:04,690
to do things and it's a one step into

1063
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:07,180
each this is the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we know how to</font>

1064
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,880
do it today then we have a two-step

1065
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:11,430
standards track the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is what</font>

1066
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,750
is called proposed standard and that

1067
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't mean its proposed to be a</font>

1068
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,130
standard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a standard at the</font>

1069
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,480
proposed level so it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

1070
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,550
passed through the working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

the iesg all of the problems that people

have found have been fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or documented</font>

00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:12,250
implement it and you implement it both

1092
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,280
from the specification without any

that remember that RCS cannot be changed

1107
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:51,259
once they're published so we can't have

or this is a full standard or this has

did not describe how the user interface

number of internal activities which they

do do workshops and other things where

1391
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,530
there's trying to set the technology

<font color="#CCCCCC">be the same so if i send you a packet</font>

1417
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:58,190
using what IP address so 128 103

1420
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:03,200
a note one day and said I need some

1421
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,059
addresses John and he sent me back a

1422
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,470
note saying here are there's your

1423
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:08,630
addresses so John was running the

1424
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:11,450
address right a top-level address or

1425

00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:17,868
different organizations around the world

1428
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:21,140
John was still providing the big blocks

1429
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:22,900
but then ripe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ap Nick and registries</font>

1430
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,609
like Nick one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our sponsors here</font>

1431
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:28,220
provide addresses to our net service

1432
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:30,609
providers and systems and and sites

1433
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:33,500
within a particular geographic dirt

1434
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:35,779
jurisdiction so John was doing the top

1435
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:39,289
level and then it became clear that

1436
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:42,799
using IP addresses to address things was

1437
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:46,700
not human friendly tell you to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 128</font>

1440
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:52,309
and people don't do numbers very well

1441
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:54,950
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the phone or something</font>

1442
00:59:52,309 --> 00:59:57,410

1443
00:59:54,950 --> 01:00:01,490
John came up with this idea of a human

1444
00:59:57,410 --> 01:00:03,649
friendly name that's a domain name which

1445
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:07,038
was used to get translated in real time

1446
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:09,019
into IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody had to</font>

1447
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:11,269

1450
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:18,349
names now who's managing those typos

1451
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:21,230
limited John did that so John was doing

1452
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:23,569
these three basic functions of protocol

1453
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:26,450
parameters address assignment and domain

1454
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:28,160
name top-level domain assignments also

1455
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:30,308
coordinating activities of the people

1456
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,529
who ran the top-level domain servers

1457
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:35,779
John then got other people to come in

1458
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:39,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> help use using US government funds</font>

1465
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:55,430

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be something other than a US</font>

government function run out of a

1468
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,160
university and he decided that he wanted

1469
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,829
to institutionalize it was the word he

1470
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,769
used to create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization to do</font>

1471
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:07,940
this function that organization turned

1472
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:10,259
out to be I can

1473
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:12,540
after a lot of machinations it turned

1474
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,569
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IQ within I can there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

1475
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:17,579

relationship with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I and a function</font>

1478
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,529
relate to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain name part and we</font>

1479
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,980
have tenuous relationship to the IP

I Anna is the only part<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

01:01:31,619 --> 01:01:34,950
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the protocol parameters</font>

1483
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:40,730
we have a memorandum of understanding

01:01:34,950 --> 01:01:40,730
with with I can to provide that function

1485
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,098
but they do provide the protocol

1486
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:50,579
parameter function so if you create a

1487
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:52,800
document an RFC that is going to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1488
01:01:50,579 --> 01:01:55,920
a protocol parameter like a new protocol

1489
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:57,960
type you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to put in your document on</font>

1490
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,240
I in a consideration section<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

please assign these values to my

01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,160

1654
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:40,659
it's all sort of a nice pass if you're

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in a professional</font>

01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:47,380
an appeals process an individual who

01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:48,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">puts forth a proposal and that proposal</font>

is turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> down by the working group and</font>

at the individual felt they were

improperly treated there must be a way

1662
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:59,230
for that individual to appeal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we</font>

1663
01:09:56,170 --> 01:10:01,270
created an appeals process relatively

1664
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:04,049
late in the game midnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> e sometime</font>

1665
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:08,140
and that appeal process actually works

1666
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:11,230
some percentage 25 or so percent of

1667
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:13,480
Appeals actually succeed that the the

1668
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:14,679
iesg is told no that was done wrong or

1669
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,769
the working group chair is saying that

1670
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">was done wrong try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so the appeals</font>

01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:28,570
copyrights is pretty straightforward if

1701
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:31,480
you write an internet draft that

1702
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet-draft on the pinnacle protocol</font>

1703
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:38,740
that you wrote you provide to the IETF

1704
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:40,870
the right to publish that and as less

1705
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:43,900
you say differently you provide to the

1706
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:47,470
IETF the right to modify it within the

1707
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:50,679
IETF process to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new document so</font>

1708
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,750
provide their derivative rights but

1709
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:54,670
they're on their own river there you

1710
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:56,610
can't revoke those rights you give them

1711
01:11:54,670 --> 01:12:00,640
to the IETF by doing the internet draft

1712
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:02,349
the ITF has the rights forever you can

1713
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,670
put a note in the in the internet draft

1714
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:05,500
saying nobody you can't make any

1715
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:08,590
derivative works and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens</font>

1716
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,300
when we're publishing corporate

1717
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,920
documentation for example to put that

1718
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:14,050
statement and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying no you</font>

1722
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,610

the the right to publish it and publish

it through the process polishes and RFC

then patents patents are much more much

1745

more harder speaking of the RFC editor

patents are a heart much harder much
