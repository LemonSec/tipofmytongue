48
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:13,690
we were collecting from Middle East and

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the is dispatch that was a claim to have</font>

50
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea for the compression value the X</font>

51
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:38,650
dispatch what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirement yeah</font>

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay nice about this job okay we that we</font>

53
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:47,229
have a draft defined in use cases we

54
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:50,400
present last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these cases have</font>

55
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,320
considered storing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non-story mode of</font>

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,960
basically communication between nodes

57
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,880
that belong to a ripple divine and knows

58
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,169
that are not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ripples of mine like</font>

59
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,979
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet or not aware a repeal note</font>

60
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:09,340
that we we have like that and for all

61
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:13,360
cases we have the combinations between

62
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,729
the cases we have 24 cases and the rules

63
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,699
for we have some rules for these

64
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:25,300
scenarios next slides the rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

65
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:29,260
we cannot modify or eliminate hitters on

66
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:33,130
the fly if we have we want to add some

67
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,230
fields we have to encapsulate jealous is

68
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,430
the rule for the scenarios expect

69
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay for the cases in a story mode</font>

70
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:50,570
basically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 cases a rough mean</font>

71
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,210
ripple<font color="#E5E5E5"> where leaf no no Raph what no</font>

72
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:56,480
ripping a web leaf and all this case in

73
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,289
story mode should have the API that is

74
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:05,150
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fec 65 53 yeah LPL option in the hot</font>

75
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:08,870
back home hidden hill and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

76
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:13,280
story mode we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need the h3 the 65</font>

77
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:15,920
54<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for these cases we will need</font>

78
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,020
encapsulation in which cases in the

79
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:21,260
cases that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> note</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

80
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,070
belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pure domain be following</font>

81
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,860
our rule obviously ok so the

82
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,360
encapsulation for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for this</font>

83
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,820
case the destination of the

84
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,470
encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we are world we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were in</font>

85
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">having some problems and how to know to</font>

86
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:44,240
pass the information to any story mode

87
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,810
to for example form through to a note

88
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,820
that doesn't belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripple the</font>

89
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:53,900
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we propose is to use hope</font>

90
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> encapsulation so in this case the</font>

91
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:01,250
encapsulation is going to end in the

92
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:03,710
last CSL air before going to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that</font>

93
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,820
doesn't belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripple so this is an</font>

94
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:08,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">air is going to remove</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI</font>

95
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,650
encapsulate field and pass information

96
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no so for it for for that one the</font>

97
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,109
dead for we have her behalf

98
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:20,630
encapsulation destination in that case

99
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,420
no Raph to<font color="#E5E5E5"> route the destination of the</font>

100
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:25,340
cancellation is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route and for</font>

101
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">example in this case from the internet</font>

102
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:31,669
to raf<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the internet they the package</font>

103
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:35,809
arrived to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 lb air so this is al ba</font>

104
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:38,180
encapsulated the PA<font color="#CCCCCC"> api in the IPV</font>

105
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:40,189
Sirius hither and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information and</font>

106
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:43,098
with the destination of the graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

107
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,750
the same for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trace cases from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

108
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:50,360
story mode to go downward we need to

109
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:57,620
specify the whole route

110
00:08:50,360 --> 00:09:02,000
so we use the LG and h3 feel sore throat

111
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:06,610
in hitter and in some cases we have FBI

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,890
on optional yes because like the road is

113
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:16,060
specified we are not going to have loop

114
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:20,300
and so we will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have api and okay</font>

115
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:23,229
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> pascal let's get you bail Serena's a</font>

116
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,199
quick note is if we use the six leverage

117
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,920
compression then the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes useful</font>

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,870
again because that's how you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

119
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,029
route of the geotag which is actually

120
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,370
used as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference for the compression</font>

121
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,320
so if you may you know belong to

122
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,870
multiple do<font color="#E5E5E5"> tags you need to know which</font>

123
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,480
route of which do tag is actually used

124
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,430
to compress everything so you find that

125
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,360
even if in theory you could live without

126
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:52,010
the FBI for one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> LC 6550 doesn't</font>

127
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,470
tell you you can you light it it says

128
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,990
you should put it and second six letter

129
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,550
H now is going to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway to make</font>

130
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,120
sure you're compressing with the right

131
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,819
route to dress so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not say we</font>

132
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,410
like it because really we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

133
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,230
thank you we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to qualify the</font>

134
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:13,449
job with it well as well for the

135
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:16,250
destination for example in this case a

136
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:17,750
from no no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does it belong to</font>

137
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,730
rebuild<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mine too I know that doesn't</font>

138
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">belong to rebuild a mine first</font>

139
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,560
encapsulation go to the road with the

140
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,920
destination after<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the CSL air in this</font>

141
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,469
case in story mode this is lb air has a

142
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,219
complete knowledge of the topology so

143
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:37,790
they put knows which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the seas el aire</font>

144
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,230
that have to send a packet and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

145
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:47,149
have this case with story mode right so

146
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,850
one next time so well in story mode it

147
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:52,610
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say the center has to know which</font>

00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:55,880
is the receiver reset receiver that is

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:58,370
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> area where and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well the solution</font>

150
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propose is say hope I hope in</font>

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,180
absolution

152
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:10,240

153
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,130
well see slow orig compressions cases

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,190
and well the document is almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> to last</font>

155
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:22,689
column is missing some information from

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">sis low air eh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we have some bites to</font>

157
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,149

158
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:32,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your opinion on the mainland is</font>

159
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,040
about this document about the use cases

160
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:45,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay please comments on the middle east</font>

161
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:48,040
on that I like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter fan of</font>

162
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,139
stock I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invite more comments</font>

163
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,880
actually in review because it's very

164
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex document I think it's very</font>

165
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,980
useful because actually it is quite

166
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:58,870
puzzling way to find all these ways and

167
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,630
to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> he musta capsulate or not and</font>

168
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:04,000
must look carefully at it so i would

169
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,370
like to invite what are two reviews of

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,899
this document and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camellia</font>

171
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:22,600
and sent in on mailing list whom will be

172
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:30,610
interested ooh add this is an exciting

173
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:32,649
moment someone who has worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our PL</font>

174
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:38,230
before and wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like pasco</font>

175
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:43,230
for example are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an author oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

176
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:50,230
a pity can't find them all oh dear

177
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:53,380
someone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> no then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to</font>

178
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:57,040
threaten somebody later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

179
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,199
we need us to refuse okay thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

180
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,750
much please read on comments in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Middle East down past can please</font>

182
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:20,230
no not just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike original said that</font>

183
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:52,929
we need a review from some of

184
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:56,079
implementers peace with you okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

185
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:57,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">voyage has been around for like your</font>

186
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,599
honor half I mean the work has been

187
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:03,849
mostly done at six low 62 pure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brantley</font>

188
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">is happy with it now but since it's</font>

189
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,470
about compressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripple artifacts in</font>

190
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,110
data packets haha SiC slow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

191
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:15,040
suggested that role does the final

192
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,100
review and goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> HD with it so that's</font>

193
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,779
what happening now changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

194
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,360
in this document before actually we

195
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,379
moved it to roll so we have improved<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

196
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,120
documentation and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work</font>

197
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:30,249
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more text about how</font>

198
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,929
addresses are coalesced which was kind

199
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:33,970
of encase it in the document initially

200
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,319
so now it's much clearer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do this</font>

201
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,629
step you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that there are number</font>

202
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:40,839
of stepwise operations which retail how

203
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:43,480
you do things and we went with that to

204
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,189
the HC plug test but the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

205
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,860
too late so there was only one

206
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:52,839
implementation so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this HC</font>

207
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,809
blood test we could not validate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

208
00:14:52,839 --> 00:15:01,209
draft that will happen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berland for</font>

209
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:04,389
the next hf well another interesting

210
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:08,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">outcome of the HC blood test is this</font>

211
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:11,499
rupture we found that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually with six</font>

212
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:16,420
lower age 60 and six up and HCM sorry

213
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:20,470
with RFC 6282 one cannot use the outer

214
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,089
header to compress the inner ater so if

215
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,450
you have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a prefix</font>

216
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,160
which is present in the header outside

217
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:30,440
encapsulated header well you cannot

218
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,040
inherit that knowledge to compress the

219
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,690
inside the inner header so considering

220
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,089
the use cases we had with a lot of

221
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,649
packets coming from the root and having

222
00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:41,540
the prefix of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root compressed with</font>

223
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:44,270
six well write without oh that would be

224
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,579
very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that the inner header</font>

225
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:50,689
is also compressed with this while this

226
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:53,870
inheritance does not exist in 6282 so we

227
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:57,709
wrote this this very small draft to say

228
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,529
if you're in the pure ripple world and

229
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:03,529
you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

230
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:06,170
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> six dope and context just to</font>

231
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:10,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">reflect the same prefix that you already</font>

232
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:15,529
compressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ripple then why don't we</font>

233
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,149
create this inheritance so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

234
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,920
interested in implementing always please

235
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:25,880
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at this drastic slow in a</font>

236
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,610
compression basically what what you get

237
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,510
with this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

238
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:36,260
6lowpan as its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> context which is used</font>

239
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,180
by 6282 and in the header compression is

240
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,680
except a new indicator context numbered

241
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,779
say where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text phone</font>

242
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,020
information well you can consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

243
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:48,200
now repo is a secondary source of

244
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,990
context the only context being the

245
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,330
prefix of the route but once you have it

246
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,310
then you can inherit that to compress

247
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,800
the whole frame inner and outer header

248
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,109
that's what is this new work brings it

249
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,359
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the HC black that's where we</font>

250
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">really discuss those things that's like</font>

251
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:10,459
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like I said like we said</font>

252
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:13,579
like we all set the six th initial draft

253
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">work split into a piece which read deals</font>

254
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:20,990
with indexing content which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> left at</font>

255
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,880
six low and is currently in let's go the

256
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,370
last call review is extended just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

257
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,280
the six leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rosco reduced extended</font>

258
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,409
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are not enough comments so</font>

259
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,740
if your interest in this space please go

260
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:36,860
to six low the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a few pages just</font>

261
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say now you can index things but they</font>

262
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,750
need your review they need your<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font>

263
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,830
to pass let's go same thing here I know

264
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,190
their implementation more

265
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,050
implementations are coming so please

266
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:52,480
write a few words to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailing list</font>

267
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:52,480
about the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal for this document</font>

268
00:17:54,670 --> 00:18:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so there are a number of issues</font>

269
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">which were discussed and it dries by</font>

270
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,700
this document you will find in

271
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,139
particular that the what was called the

272
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:10,400
air<font color="#E5E5E5"> h3 loh is now called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s rh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rh there</font>

273
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,430
was a discrepancy between the

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,010
granularity that we had above the rpi

275
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,630
cigarette<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am the one below with your</font>

276
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,340
address is very right so we thought to

277
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,420
keep things consistent at the same level

278
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,250
now the we keep things abstract and we

279
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,710
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it specifically for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> archery we</font>

280
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">say it's for a rotten either so we call</font>

281
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,380
the option SRH supposed to rh so they

282
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">must still be in the slide somewhere to</font>

283
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,320
mention their age 36 garage but it's now

284
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:42,200
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s LH</font>

285
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:46,210
six large and then I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of</font>

286
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:49,450
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how things are comprised the</font>

287
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:52,640
first thing that that just consider is

288
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:56,210
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the forwarding plane</font>

289
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,280
easy we wanted to enable in the ripple

290
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,280
forwarding plane the concept of a fast

291
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,410
path meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the router as a</font>

292
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,420
minimum set of informations to run a

293
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,300
minimum messaging of the packets to

294
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,850
operate and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinners has said we have</font>

295
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:14,419
to virtually untouched lady capsulate

296
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,459
all sorts of stuff and if you had to do

297
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,370
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the real packets in the</font>

298
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:22,820
ipv6 formats as we used to that would be

299
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:26,060
very complex moving around process but

300
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:29,960
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was six or a cheese is order</font>

301
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:32,300
things in a way that the code in the

302
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,270
intermediate router net can be very fast

303
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,700
and very simple so<font color="#E5E5E5"> inshallah if you</font>

304
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,879
decompress things you like a normal ipv6

305
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,890
packet but in the compressed form things

306
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,640
are other differently so that the router

307
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:49,100
operation can be very quick and very

308
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect of that the</font>

309
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,100
first place where this occur is

310
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:58,600
if you have a packet which is generated

311
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root so it doesn't need IP IP</font>

312
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,870
encapsulation there's just the ripple by

313
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,270
get information in the hop by hop header

314
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:10,340
with the six in our age you basically

315
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:12,139
place the<font color="#CCCCCC"> API NRH before the IP packet</font>

316
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,760
so you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the headers have been</font>

317
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,100
moved from the original format the

318
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,669
original format noncom price would be IP

319
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,639
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> hub a harp option and the rest and</font>

320
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:26,419
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now that the Reaper option</font>

321
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,059
is before<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but the compressed</font>

322
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:31,040
form of that is well the non compressed

323
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:34,190
form of that is really hot by up after

324
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,230
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address okay so that allows us</font>

325
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">two things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

326
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,250
process the ripple thing without looking

327
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,340
at the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

328
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,010
that it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do is keep the code</font>

329
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was handling the 6282 packet</font>

330
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:51,110
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a church so you can really add</font>

331
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:57,440
this fast path operation without

332
00:20:51,110 --> 00:21:00,649
changing your 6282 passer next line okay

333
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,169
um just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the fragmentation</font>

334
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,120
as defined for the 944 is not change so

335
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:07,370
whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> six or Rachel not six</font>

336
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,489
leverage you can steal fragment things

337
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:13,760
exactly the way you did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 reg just</font>

338
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,710
like the air I<font color="#E5E5E5"> phc are after the</font>

339
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,360
fragment so the fragmentation is

340
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:26,440
independent and whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sees no</font>

341
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:29,209
Rachel not<font color="#E5E5E5"> look slide next oh so</font>

342
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,850
basically this is more words to say why

343
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,760
and where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the final order of</font>

344
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:37,520
things basically what it boils down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

345
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,520
say is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of iph</font>

346
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,510
encapsulation that's the first IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

347
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,010
header that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second IP either you</font>

348
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,350
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we always start with a</font>

349
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,990
sorcerer header so because when you have

350
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,689
to to rub this packet what you really

351
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:56,690
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is pop the first entry the</font>

352
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,690
first next up in this rotten either so

353
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,480
by placing this first it makes the

354
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:05,929
forwarding plane easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to move</font>

355
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,049
forward by one okay on this on decider

356
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:11,210
and then when you're done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

357
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:14,690
outer IP then you just truncate

358
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,580
everything and you continue so the fast

359
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,700
path processing of this packet is

360
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,740
actually very simple even if in theory

361
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:28,970
that the non compressed format is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

362
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:32,690
same as usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok next and then I'm</font>

363
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:35,299
giving more examples of that so just the

364
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,820
small remark is if we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using this new</font>

365
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:43,190
draft is enough compression draft then

366
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:46,340
the the inner header here can inherit

367
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,549
the prefix from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> al-qaeda that's what</font>

368
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,860
I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

369
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:54,980
do this new draft then you have to have

370
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,979
one a ripple context based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

371
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,840
and to a 6lowpan context<font color="#E5E5E5"> which will have</font>

372
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,999
the exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix and you will have</font>

373
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">to distribute both repo distributes the</font>

374
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:06,909
roots with the DI<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and through a race</font>

375
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,169
will distribute the 6<font color="#CCCCCC"> lépine context</font>

376
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:11,600
distributing the 12 them for a single

377
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:14,029
result seems like an evacuee so that's

378
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,959
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we introduced this in your head or</font>

379
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:19,490
thing we are pretty there so thanks

380
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,669
Michael thanks a lot for being the

381
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shepherd for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this work and guys please</font>

383
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:28,939
always said today and on the draft so

384
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:32,840
that we can conclude the last go and go

385
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:37,190
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berlin fight drug test Thank you</font>

386
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:48,980
Thank You Pascal so we're really looking

387
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:51,679
forward for other commands yes so Tomas

388
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:54,559
Medina just let you know about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood</font>

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">test in Berlin that will take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

390
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">right before the IDF meeting I think the</font>

391
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:03,350
dates are 16 17 I believe that's July

392
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:04,969
and so this this will most probably I

393
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,580
cannot say it definitely because we

394
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,869
haven't formed a group yet but what is

395
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,449
most probably going to be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

396
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:12,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are tested so we were going</font>

397
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,749
to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if you're interested</font>

398
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,759
contact us and participated like this

399
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:19,009
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well it will be nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

400
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:19,399
people read the draft before they start

401
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,080
in

402
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:23,149
mendations so would really encourage

403
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,468
them that in the coming two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

404
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:26,658
we still have the working group last

405
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:28,700
school that they sent in their comments

406
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:30,950
and or at least show their interest and

407
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,749
sent in comments like we have seen it

408
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:34,519
there has already been extensive

409
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:36,440
discussion about this draft in the six

410
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,479
law working group and before they have

411
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,609
much internal communication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe</font>

412
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:42,769
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually satisfied the</font>

413
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:44,299
requirements but it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

414
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:48,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">from everybody that they have read it</font>

415
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:51,710
and approve it thank you do we have

416
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:58,218
reviewer for this document someone want

417
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:59,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> review the document basket no yes I</font>

418
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:04,609
just what till you pick Michael is

419
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:12,679
sitting on the queue he probably has a

420
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:15,259
question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pascale hi I'm Megan hi hi</font>

421
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,879
so uh so honest you know one of the

422
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:20,389
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would wonder if you could</font>

423
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:24,738
speculate for us is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a cost in</font>

424
00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:27,019
six low<font color="#CCCCCC"> rh for the fact that we have to</font>

425
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:32,149
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our pie before we get to the</font>

426
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:34,639
non RPL node would 60 rh be uh would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

in the thing you speculate on that i can

give you one speculation Michael it's a

whether what the operation should be in

that we picked for the the ripple option

says if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it drop it which</font>

467
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:24,770
the proposed on table to help us sure is

to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh we go from 63 to 43 meaning</font>

we want to to you that Michaels point

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,969
device right right but but the point is

482
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:02,949
is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some effort to be</font>

483
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,690
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to essentially say that we are</font>

484
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,240
doing encapsulation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsulation</font>

485
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,679
and IP IP headers on a hop by hop basis

486
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,320
which changes the addresses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

487
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,669
outside that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in which</font>

488
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,389
means which may make them less

489
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:20,090
compressible which is one concern I have

490
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:22,820
such that we can remove if necessary if

491
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,439
you've pointed out we can remove all the

492
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,899
compression and we can deliver the

493
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,160
packet to an end hosts that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

494
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:34,070
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> six lower h or ripple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah and we</font>

495
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,309
can do that but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

496
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">officially room have that IP IP header</font>

497
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:42,049
there we wouldn't have to compress it

498
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,290
and we could just deliver a packet

499
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:47,090
directly to the the end hosts with the

500
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpi still</font>

501
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:53,300
there yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we could leave it I</font>

502
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,899
mean that's the question is really for

503
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,610
the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> six or six lr knowing whether</font>

504
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,950
it should remove it or not which is

505
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,300
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> living it or removing it is</font>

506
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,800
not so complex the question is to know

507
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,600
whether you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not because</font>

508
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,629
you don't know what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of device you</font>

509
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,730
have to deliver the packet to which is

510
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tree the problem that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in</font>

511
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:17,150
this face all I'm saying is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weights</font>

512
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,030
formatted right now the packet from from

513
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,950
the root with just an LP I is formatted

514
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:24,080
like you get a six dollar edged with the

515
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,540
rpi easy to remove and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

516
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,149
after is the 60 to 80 2 pi get the way a

517
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,460
plane host expects that so that's we the

518
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:34,310
design point now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision of leaving</font>

519
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">it or not leaving it is kind of</font>

520
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:39,710
orthogonal it's just easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove it</font>

521
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,390
that's the only design<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> race but but</font>

522
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,750
but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> still concerned about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

523
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,520
compression of that outer IP IP header

524
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:49,490
particularly in the not fast path case

525
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:52,460
where for instance we are obligated to

526
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,780
generate an ICMP from that last host to

527
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,970
say for instance host and reachable

528
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,980
which we would then send the previous

529
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:03,050
hop which would be meaningless to send

530
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:04,610
it to the previous hop right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

531
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,760
there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff there that</font>

532
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:10,550
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing to keep the that IP IP</font>

533
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,010
header intact because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth IP</font>

534
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:14,930
and the six-man rules about adding and

535
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:16,250
subtracting headers<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as a bunch of</font>

536
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing so that we are</font>

537
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:23,060
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reconstruct the uncompressed</font>

538
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,220
packet and in such a way that we it's

539
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,280
addressed to that host so that we can

540
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:30,650
remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI right we're doing that</font>

541
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,490
stuff to do that so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if</font>

542
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:40,010
we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do be so careful would</font>

543
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:42,080
we be able to compress better I don't

544
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:45,770
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compress</font>

545
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,139
better I see that we would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

546
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to it would be easier to</font>

547
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,280
encapsulate because you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

548
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,470
say what's node which will be capsulate

549
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:56,210
that would be the final destination

550
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now promise we need to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

551
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,170
indicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the six a law that serves</font>

552
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this final destination is the one that</font>

553
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,260
should the gaps

554
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,760
light and we don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

555
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,500
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would simplify our life at the</font>

556
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,510
encapsulation time but they don't see

557
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,760
how the compression would be better so

558
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,550
for me it's kind of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> 26 marriage is</font>

559
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,100
more the police see how we decide to do

560
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,360
what it's a rotting<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime its</font>

561
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,040
architecture prime but it's the

562
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,260
compression just serves the need that

563
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,360
you have and you can compress what you

564
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,010
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm just trying to figure</font>

565
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,919
out what the case for changing the type

566
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,500
code is if that if the result is you

567
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,790
know to bite savings on every hop then

568
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,800
that would seem to be a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

569
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,510
argument for why we should change it

570
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,310
immediately because we have it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

571
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:44,040
with this document we have essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

572
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,990
flag day right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there uh we do not we do</font>

573
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,409
not propose at this point any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

574
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:51,750
signaling to say we support this new new

575
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:54,270
protocol or we don't it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

576
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:56,100
the operator network installer who

577
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:58,200
either turns this on because all the

578
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,300
devices support it or leaves it off

579
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,910
because some devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't support it</font>

580
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,120
right so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opportunity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

581
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:09,480
flag day here yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the only value</font>

582
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,899
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see is to enable the source of the</font>

583
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,900
packet to hung capsulate down to the

584
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,550
destination right right we keep I IP

585
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,010
down to the destination there's nothing

586
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,470
to do with compression really<font color="#E5E5E5"> could lead</font>

587
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,820
us to do be with being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to solve a</font>

588
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,040
crime that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to solve</font>

589
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,950
otherwise or we've got this wheel<font color="#CCCCCC"> out by</font>

590
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,440
hop operation which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very weird and</font>

591
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,210
even if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that hello us to know is</font>

592
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,910
this last six at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all and it should not</font>

593
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,310
redo this IP nappies so we basically

594
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,290
it's a much cleaner design to be able to

595
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:42,629
say i'm doing a pin IP to the final

596
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,879
destination and generally reason why we

597
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,670
could not do that it's because of this

598
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:53,010
code they are by hospital the time is

599
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:54,990
slowly passing thanks thanks very much

600
00:32:53,010 --> 00:33:04,020
could you continue it on the email

601
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:07,190
mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are should have</font>

602
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,190
remotely wrong

603
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,990
hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope everyone can hear me okay</font>

604
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:22,699
alright so I'll just start so the

605
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:26,360
drop-off circles then opened our

606
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:32,020
problems that are specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

607
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:36,649
the modules hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> no yes way please</font>

608
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:44,170
thank you yeah is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my article</font>

609
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:47,210
enough it's okay all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right okay so</font>

610
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:49,550
nobody just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just a little recap on</font>

611
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,530
what nope at dow is the no path now is

612
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:56,290
essentially in the down with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetime</font>

00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,710

616
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:06,620
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's old previous part and a regular</font>

617
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,080
dau why its new path so it traverses in

618
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,609
all the cases all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> towels likewise</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> regular doubt the name feed also</font>

620
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:16,250
traverses upwards along the topology in

621
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,490
the upstream direction so you I new bat

622
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,290
dau might be important for us so as you

623
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might already know that</font>

627
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:32,000
does if there is a contention it will be

00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:34,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice for the routers to know which which</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">removed or can be replaced with this</font>

631
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,600
when the another important point here is

632
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,310
when the nodes which is a parent it's

633

<font color="#E5E5E5">not only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know which is just the</font>

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:50,149
parent but it's the complete dependent

635
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:53,658
know it all the all the other different

636
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:56,089
nodes along along beneath that give that

638

it's kind of a lot of lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

please up on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

646
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,799
this is the sample topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

647
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:23,000
considering let's for the sea

648
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,580
of this discussion considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

649
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,490
topology no<font color="#CCCCCC"> D might switch from parent</font>

v2c for certain reasons such as

651
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,890
transient or permanent link failure

652
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:36,860
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason would be that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D finds a</font>

653
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:38,810
better parent in the form of C which

654
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,390
satisfies better which which has better

655
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:53,750
metrics as compared to X previous path

656
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:55,580
through be can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike a bit hello do</font>

657
00:35:53,750 --> 00:36:04,310
you want me to hold the mic ilu<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

658
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">off Oh a bit closer they Mike please</font>

659
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:11,990
yeah yeah is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah yeah alright</font>

660
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:17,960
so this is the sample topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am</font>

661
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:19,459
considering here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so these are</font>

662
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,040
the cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have highlighted where</font>

663
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,320
node<font color="#CCCCCC"> B switches from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lodi switches from</font>

664
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,390
node B to C for various reasons such as

665
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">link breakages because of transient or</font>

666
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:30,710
permanent<font color="#E5E5E5"> green failures or a simple</font>

667
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,660
reason such that you the new metric

668
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,940
metric from from the previous parent has

669
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,160
went bad and there is an alternative

670
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:38,660
path available through<font color="#E5E5E5"> C so this is</font>

671
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,660
another reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> when NP doubt can be</font>

672
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,549
generated in all the cases currently the

673
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,680
NP doubt can be generated through the

674
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,290
previous path that no D has the

675
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,220
responsibility of sending the NP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dow</font>

676
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:54,290
wire its previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> part so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

677
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,720
problems that we might face because of

678
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this arrangement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide talks</font>

679
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it is gone to them so this this is</font>

680
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially is are all the is the</font>

681
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,420
list of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are associated</font>

682
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NP doubt mechanism currently</font>

683
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,890
specified in the article specifications

684
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:14,720
so the first the first biggest problem

685
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,940
is the NP down messaging depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

686
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,750
link which the node had decided already

687
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:22,880
know log or decided to no longer use

688
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:25,250
because of whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason especially if</font>

689
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,680
the reason is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the link</font>

690
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:29,120
failure then the NP dome messaging will

691
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,970
definitely suffer it's a guaranteed

692
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,440
failure of NP double messaging there

693
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:35,419
another important point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of a</font>

694
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,490
to hear is that went wrong

695
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the invalidation happens only for the</font>

696
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:42,979
load hood channel rates NP<font color="#E5E5E5"> thomas's now</font>

697
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are dependent nodes on behalf of</font>

698
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:48,710
whom there is no NP de which is

699
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:50,210
generated all together so on the

700
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,510
previous part there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way of</font>

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">generating off route invalidation along</font>

702
00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:02,119
the previous path yeah excuse me<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

703
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:04,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pass</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get severe here normally</font>

704
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:06,049
you're expected to keep the so first

705
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:08,240
let's not mention but this is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

706
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:10,430

<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain you expect to basically</font>

711
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,098
citizens Victor you expect to know who

712
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:23,660
is behind each of your children right

713
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:28,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've got this child and through this</font>

child I can reach this sub dag and you

715
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,759
know this child to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the world</font>

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,710
connectivity to that particular child

718
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:39,680
then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this child is lost</font>

719
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,720
for you but you also know that if he was

720
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,390
the only way to get to all this served

721
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,029
AG then all the nodes in this set dark

722
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:50,270
are lost as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're entitled to</font>

send a note out to all of them is no

double its name Pete<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah are so</font>

725
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,250
essentially what you're seeing your

726
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:59,839
password is I let me just recap you're

727
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,290
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a possibility that</font>

728
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,630
nobody knows that that the child e is

729
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:11,240
not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> right considering the</font>

00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:16,069
topology shown in the hello how to show

731
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:20,479
you so sorry can you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say tag up</font>

732
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:22,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">no the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subject that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you lose because if</font>

733
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,160
you know you lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> a child then because</font>

734
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:27,859
you get the route via this child to all

735
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest of that tag and you also know</font>

736
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:32,808
that you lose this step deck so you can

737
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:35,420
found a new path<font color="#CCCCCC"> dau for all the</font>

738
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:39,290
children of this of your children all

739
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the family if you like those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

740
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,089
guys on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of your drawing they</font>

741
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,630
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a no doubt if this guy moves</font>

742
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,630
from left to right

743
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:52,550
are you saying you can can you cope with

744
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,050
an example here I mean if I've

745
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,750
understood<font color="#E5E5E5"> it correctly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regression a</font>

746
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,790
nice good but i'm seein names from where

747
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:03,650
i am and that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ABCD but i don't</font>

748
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:05,900
see them from where i am it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font>

749
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:09,590
so you seem to be saying that there is

750
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:11,930
if d goes away from be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok d goes away</font>

751
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,550
from be so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

752
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:17,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand you are saying that there is</font>

753
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:19,850
no no path battle from for<font color="#CCCCCC"> E or F all</font>

754
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,230
right and I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is because be</font>

755
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:26,690
as a route to EV rd adesso route to FB

756
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:30,350
ID and that's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> way he knows how</font>

757
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:33,790
to get so if you lose is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route to d</font>

758
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:38,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you will also lose the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right to e and 2f</font>

759
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:43,940
so is untitled to sound no path now for

760
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:45,590
d4 p.m. for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us no yeah first year the</font>

761
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,510
assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the no part now has</font>

762
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:49,880
actually reached reached from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

763
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,180
previous panel so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first point here</font>

764
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,070
takes takes care of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I mean such is the</font>

765
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:00,259
problem that the NPD of itself might not

766
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:01,640
reaching all the cases I mean along the

767
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,590
previous path there is a possibility

768
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,359
that infidel might not reach at all

769
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,890
because of the permanent link failure

770
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,350
let's say for example let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font>

771
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,120
scenario of permanent link failure so

772
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,430
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a there is a chance that you</font>

773
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,740
know NP da might not reach at all so

774
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:19,490
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no that there is a guaranteed</font>

775
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,350
not working of NP de might not work in a

776
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,259
guaranteed way if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a permanent</font>

777
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:26,240
ink failure along the previous time if

778
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're saying if there is a way if there</font>

779
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an alternative way of GU realizing</font>

780
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,540
that there is a link breakage then it

781
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,190
can generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this in the subsequent</font>

782
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,080
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will just talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know</font>

783
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,810
what are the problems that you know all

784
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:41,569
the other nodes kept the there is a

785
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:44,900
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the sense that and</font>

786
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:47,060
another node cannot generate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> low fat</font>

787
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,950
now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf of the target node so</font>

788
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,570
especially because there is a there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

789
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:55,819
dependency in terms of state information

790
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:57,950
such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dow sequence so it's I mean</font>

791
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,900
there is there ism there is a sentence

792
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,560
there is a line that is a statement

793
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,570
mentioned

794
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,049
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> artists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay expect which talks</font>

795
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:08,270
about sending a packet a packet to

796
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,370
invalidate the routes and clear the

797
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">states clear the Argos state but it is</font>

798
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,240
easier said than done you know

799
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:23,480
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> because every town has state</font>

800
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:28,279
information so I'll just continue with

801
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,230
the presentation that there's still very

802
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,650
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> time left do you have can you</font>

803
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:35,150
conclude yeah here let me just previous

804
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:38,720
go on to the previous slide just I just

805
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,610
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight the problems the other</font>

806
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,359
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so can you can can you</font>

807
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:48,290
please go on to the previous line it

808
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:51,170
comes account here can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you please move</font>

809
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to the previous slide again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the yeah</font>

810
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,920
so here the other problems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

811
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,629
mentioned is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possibility of crowd</font>

812
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,030
type route down time because of the

813
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:01,340
asynchronous operations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> entry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tower</font>

814
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,960
and down so NP<font color="#E5E5E5"> da is sent through</font>

815
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,670
another path and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is sent through</font>

816
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,680
another another<font color="#E5E5E5"> path so there is a</font>

817
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibility that NP de actually reaches</font>

818
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,040
and out never reaches because even

819
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,509
though I even do it the the load has

820
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,009
sent the doubt that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are there is no</font>

821
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,290
guarantee that now might actually reach

822
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:20,510
the water<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so there is a possibility</font>

823
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because of this synchronous mode of</font>

824
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,820
operation that there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> downtime</font>

825
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,470
secondly in terms of let's assume for

826
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,810
the sake of discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is no</font>

827
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,600
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know clearing clearing the</font>

828
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing table if there is no impede out</font>

829
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,850
reaching the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> part in which case</font>

830
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,280
there is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on p2p traffic the</font>

831
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,920
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of a foo here shows an</font>

832
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:47,060
example if<font color="#E5E5E5"> G originates up traffic for e</font>

833
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,280
and f and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> G has invalidated invalid</font>

834
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:54,080
routes then it will cause traffic

835
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,610
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok thank you how will I think I</font>

836
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,920
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to conclude because the</font>

837
00:43:55,610 --> 00:44:00,380
communication is not really optimal and

838
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,560
also the time is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on if you don't</font>

839
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:05,930
mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we maybe conclude and then</font>

840
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,270
you nice discussion issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> million means</font>

841
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,830
i can just at the point that i want you

842
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,840
to make is from the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

843
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,740
of view what can be an optimal<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution</font>

844
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,230
for an MP now salute

845
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,390
bit of a problem statement so the the

846
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">next couple of slides talks about the</font>

847
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,930
possible existing solutions and which<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

848
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:27,180
discussed on the mailing list thanks to

849
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:28,890
some kind salmon and then maybe on the

850
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide talks about some</font>

00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know using douek mechanism that is</font>

from the requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to you yeah</font>

this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the final final</font>

00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,730
the NPD of messaging should be taught in

more in a more in a more concrete way

867
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:11,730
rather than depending upon some

870
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,720
network formation is handled by our peel

871
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,310
the network throughout formation is

else which can be handed quantity by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements point of him yeah</font>

880
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,940
that's the that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

884
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:53,790
then later on we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will seek solutions can</font>

889

an old<font color="#E5E5E5"> fish in the old working group</font>

891
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:23,790
that there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a management and MEB</font>

892
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,190
to define the parameters and to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

893
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,720
the operation of nipple and ripple so

894
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,330
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done now is that you</font>

895
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,700
didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nip in this my language</font>

896
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,980
but we have used young which is a more

897
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,930
convenient language here to describe

898
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,090
good model so what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

899
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:40,980
just described to model and see if there

900
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:43,490
is any interest that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue this</font>

901
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:48,210
work in this working group I have

902
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:50,819
separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model in four parts as far</font>

903
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:54,000
as i remember one is about how the

904
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:56,190
multicast addresses spin up a domain

905
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,710
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> maple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows domains which has</font>

906
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:03,150
spent up by multicast addresses next

907
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:05,010
slide please then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a set of</font>

908
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,500
operational parameters which are the

909
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:10,410
setting actually of the people such as

910
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:12,780
the lifetime the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight the amine</font>

911
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:16,069
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emacs which other operational</font>

912
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:22,620
parameters used to start the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maple</font>

913
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:25,290
operation of the next section that is

914
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,350
the actual execution of the maple spare

915
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">seat and ending the domain so that well</font>

916
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:36,630
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can see how the</font>

917
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:38,430
parameters perform for example this here

918
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,560
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the pocket that current</font>

919
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:43,410
interval the seat count on how many

920
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:49,020
packets has arrived and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t that an</font>

921
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:51,089
expected has to be sent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finally</font>

922
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,500
the statistics which gives you from how

923
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">many messages have been received</font>

924
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,660
forwarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read a rejected not</font>

925
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,720
received etc so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four parts</font>

926
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,460
I would welcome some some comments on

927
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,129
the mailing list because the domain is

928
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,930
rather complex with lots of a race you

929
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:09,120
may say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a small device that's</font>

930
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,770
not wanted at all and that the move for

931
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,440
example the domain definition is too

932
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,920
complex or that you say the different

933
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,250
item

934
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,990
stay must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> separated and you can do</font>

935
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:21,809
actually determine if you want an item

936
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:25,859
in in a note or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were the</font>

937
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:29,030
sterile questions my question is there

938
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:36,420
any interest to continue this work here

939
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:40,190
no no yes oh thank you it was not to

940
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:47,390
know another yes oh good more yeses oh

941
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:55,770
yes yes good fine and stern oh yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

942

no nose no okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you okay</font>

943
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:02,339
now we are going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

944
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:05,578
return tell in case I we go through that

945
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:08,940
and we have to define like some topics

946
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:11,910
to work on will be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how to fix</font>

947
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,980
topics like if we have already documents

948
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,078
that are interested for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

949
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:39,930
group would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to integrating a</font>

950
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:43,250
stretcher ok we have um ok we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like</font>

951
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:49,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">a some items for maintenance the</font>

952
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:54,630
protocols like well a proposed from raul

953
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:58,920
oh we have as well some other draft that

954
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:01,049
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so much and make me about</font>

955
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:06,000
this modification so<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be nice if you</font>

956
00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">can review they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

957
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:13,500
graph and send your comments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pascal</font>

958
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:16,529
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell projection do you want like</font>

959
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:19,890
we have a some story mode in non

960
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:22,369
stirring you want to say something about

961
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font>

962
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:36,390
are you I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the doubt</font>

963
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">projection qualifies as maintenance it's</font>

964
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:42,509
it's a new work it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

965
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:44,370
ripple in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN the world so that I</font>

966
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:49,890
think that's interesting enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

967
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:58,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard on point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a the early</font>

968
00:50:49,890 --> 00:51:07,279
with these what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think ice what do</font>

969
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:07,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

970
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:22,560
okay that's a little india okay let me

971
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:29,279
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pissed anybody else who has read the</font>

972
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:33,299
past DOL draft from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a skull yeah very</font>

973
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">good so does interest and we want to</font>

974
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,930
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work yes no for me as well</font>

975
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:44,960
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saw it was interesting yeah my</font>

976
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:47,520
other people are interested then the

977
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,470
automatic selection okay this is another

978
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,780
point which came for me if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

979
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:54,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nipple and you have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very dense</font>

980
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:57,690
network with lots of maple forwarders

981
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,970
then but you get to too many much too

982
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:04,290
many a slightly a package which are

983
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:05,970
sensory<font color="#CCCCCC"> catan so no pocus almost so what</font>

984
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,950
I propose is that as an automatic

985
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:09,810
selection of maple forwarders dependent

986
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,370
on the density of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so that</font>

987
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:13,380
you reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of verbal</font>

988
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:15,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">forbearers and you haven't possibly</font>

989
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,090
minimum the most maple forwarders is

990
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:20,850
there anyone interested in continuing in

991
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:26,640
that work or<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing it is positive to</font>

992
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:33,860
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I certainly wanted to start</font>

993
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:33,859
it but if there is no interest in it no

994
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:42,359
it's a nice man

995
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:44,940
medical problem she said and fairly

996
00:52:42,359 --> 00:53:10,288
satisfied in with adverse of course no

997
00:52:44,940 --> 00:53:13,160
okay so okay so in general looking at

998
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:17,069
how we could improve the the multicast

999
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">good entering that working okay are the</font>

1000
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:25,230
other people interested in multicast

1001
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:26,789
work in this context no so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1002
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:32,880
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that's interesting</font>

1003
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:35,190
five fine great so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> already looked at</font>

1004
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,230
the data models for ripple and maple and

1005
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was sufficient interest</font>

1006
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:44,160
to at least continue it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you want to</font>

1007
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:56,520
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about your source of the</font>

1008
00:53:44,160 --> 00:54:03,420
multicast thank you a better not touch

1009
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:06,750
it so 38 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a short</font>

1010
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:10,220
presentation I think at six low on this

1011
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:12,630
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using ripple for source voltage</font>

1012
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:16,740
multicast this is essentially taking the

1013
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:20,099
ideas of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer group and applying</font>

1014
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,689
them to too constrained environments so

1015
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:25,440
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for presentation time</font>

1016
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:30,230
here because time is short so you can

1017
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">look up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides from a year ago and</font>

1018
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:36,569
this has been implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1019
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">simulations have been run the ends on so</font>

1020
00:54:36,569 --> 00:54:44,750
it generally seems to work and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1021
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:47,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some low latency multicast</font>

1022
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,870
that may be a way to do that

1023
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:53,350
but it certainly would benefit from more

1024
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:56,470
people looking looking at it then the

1025
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece then you do such as saying it will</font>

1026
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">be nice if it would be compared by and</font>

1027
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,610
performance comparison with others<font color="#CCCCCC"> such</font>

1028
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,169
that you know at least then to apply

1029
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:06,820
because having all those multicast

1030
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:11,080
algorithms around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not knowing when</font>

1031
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,610
to apply it it's not the best things but

1032
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,819
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the performance issues</font>

1033
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:18,760
it's also an issue what roles do you

1034
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:21,520
give the nodes in the network so nipple

1035
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:26,130
makes relatively high requirements on

1036
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,470
all the non<font color="#E5E5E5"> root routers in the network</font>

1037
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:33,130
this constraint cast really is non

1038
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">storing mode Saudi everybody else but</font>

1039
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,910
the root has no idea what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1040
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forwards packets according to</font>

1041
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:46,390
what's in the package let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch email</font>

1042
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:49,000
I one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I support this work and the</font>

1043
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:51,220
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is this it seems tint in</font>

1044
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,070
tainted off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> flag multicast but the</font>

1045
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:56,740
use of beer for repo can be of interest

1046
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:58,930
for unicast as well as multicast and the

1047
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:00,600
value would be a better compression of

1048
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,350
what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for unicast</font>

1049
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,110
simplification of what you put in the

1050
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:07,000
dough you just with a simple bitmaps you

1051
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:10,000
can aggregate all the dowel rods and

1052
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,970
that basically gives us with a limited

1053
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,460
state the capability to do a story mode

1054
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,259
in modes which would not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> capable of</font>

1055
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:18,910
doing story mode is there to store the

1056
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,900
full of dresses so you would basically

1057
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:25,330
express each router with a bit so not

1058
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">only is this very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting that the</font>

1059
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:30,700
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Gaston is proposing us but the</font>

1060
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:38,650
fact of using beer in repo i think is of

1061
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:43,689
high interest thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yes micro</font>

1062
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">regional said that if a it's cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forum</font>

1063
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:52,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a route initiating multicast can we</font>

1064
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:53,980
use it for female updates yes that he

1065
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,860
says that this is cool for route

1066
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:01,770
initiated multicast yeah he asked is you

1067
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,770
can we use it for few more updates yes

1068
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:09,029
that's an application question and it

1069
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,790
depends what kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> software you have</font>

1070
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:18,530
in your device to do this firmware

1071
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:22,500
update so in principle yes so I using

1072
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:24,000
IDs from beer for these networks i think

1073
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,250
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting as well for doing</font>

1074
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,880
replication<font color="#CCCCCC"> and an increasing</font>

1075
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:33,810
reliability so I support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I work</font>

1076
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:36,119
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Thomas cast woman I hope I'm</font>

1077
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:38,549
not jumping the gun here but there is a

1078
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:42,540
lot of interest in working on firmware

1079
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:44,880
updates in the IETF and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF right</font>

1080
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:50,490
now so stay tuned there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

1081
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:53,100
announcement soon Thank You Carson so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:59,220
have three minutes left some other

1083
00:57:53,100 --> 00:58:02,759
comments well there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a presentation</font>

1084
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:05,910
yesterday at six TCH<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think people they</font>

1085
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,940
are risen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area still about LDV</font>

1086
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:12,480
and ripple a there was a male<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

1087
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:19,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">east so please read the draft and send</font>

1088
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:27,990

00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:32,190
business yeah so anyway many thanks for

1090
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:34,618
the the comments on the topics for the

1091
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,600
possible recharter so we will propose

1092
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:39,020
that again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> berlin and then see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font>

1093
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:42,000
thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter may look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1094
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:45,450
I'm pleased for the new ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came</font>

1095
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:50,609
late a review day the draft from roti

1096
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:53,250
dispatch paging from cislo and they use

1097
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:57,960
of fpl info please we need your comments

1098
