00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,180
happened on jabber it looks like he's

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,860
available but he was telling me that he

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:52,510
said and son live situation from prior

7
00:00:48,860 --> 00:01:00,519
meeting so let's hope this or what else

8
00:00:52,510 --> 00:01:06,789
you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> also perhaps the next share</font>

13
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,940

22
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:39,078
second session just one hour most of

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:43,400
focus our non-work<font color="#E5E5E5"> milestone work items</font>

24
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:46,850
and we'll first also<font color="#E5E5E5"> get update for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

26
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:57,350
the inside probe progress this time only

27
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:59,209
input strap has made such<font color="#CCCCCC"> request then</font>

28
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:03,519
we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the autonomic function</font>

knife lifecycle management by PR

30
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,459

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,109
sure I guess finally if we had enough

38
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,280
time we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> information distribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

40
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:48,080
the Nets moved to Mac so we haven't

41
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten mex get so okay skip for now and</font>

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:56,470
could hit back when<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so pure PR PR</font>

43
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get ready right now but it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

44
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,930
not still<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the jabber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but he was</font>

45
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:22,969
saying that he had sun room movement

46
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:27,560
problem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pierre well here just dropped</font>

47
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:30,110
from the jabber so come to the wonderful

48
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:37,360
world of remote participation shall we

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:37,360
move to Laurent yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> na rent I our</font>

52
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:07,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the whole station for each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

53
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:13,970
that's not enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay so all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

54
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:20,270
y'all and when you run out of slides

55
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:22,820
just dance sorry no he if you want is

56
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:30,919
there enough discussions with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket for</font>

57
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:41,060
hour maybe two<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay understand yeah it</font>

58
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:43,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">works okay Mike good afternoon so this</font>

59
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,680
is Jefferson<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to present the</font>

60
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">dredge out on our network intent and</font>

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,780
forward so next slide okay

62
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,169
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on the version 3 of the</font>

63
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,859
draft and is uh there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

64
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:05,639
from previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the most</font>

65
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,909
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some modifications</font>

66
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,840
in the introduction when we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

67
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:12,659
information about policy based

68
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,289
management also there are some changes

69
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">in terminology using the document for</font>

70
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:24,539
example terms like intent domain and the

71
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy there is also an organization on</font>

72
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:29,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> use case sections and I'm going to</font>

73
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about the use case later in the</font>

74
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,449
presentation and also we added some

75
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:39,560
information on distribution aspects

76
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:44,190
management and interpretation next slide

77
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,500
so from the reference model document we

78
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:49,080
have the autonomic<font color="#CCCCCC"> network intent as</font>

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,020
abstract declarative high-level policy

80
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,620
used to operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> autonomic domains such</font>

81
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,109
as an enterprise network so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

82
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:02,639
description<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have on the on the</font>

83
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:05,280
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> model next slide so in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in our</font>

84
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,789
document we try to give more details

85
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,210
about the usage of auto non-key intent

86
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:14,250
policies so first one is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

87
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,529
break at work probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> will comprise</font>

88
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:21,090
multiple intent policies beside that

89
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:24,599
these policies will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interpreted at</font>

90
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,609
different levels in the network so the

91
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,779
level of understanding the hands on the

92
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:34,289
capabilities of the devices so this has

93
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:37,560
an impact on how the intent is

94
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:41,150
interpreted in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and also it</font>

95
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,500
means that there are there will be some

96
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:48,900
devices or functions that must translate

97
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:53,400
the intent for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different devices in</font>

98
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:57,270
the network of course this helps this

99
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,750
helps to address the throw Jenna<font color="#E5E5E5"> T of</font>

100
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that comprises not on</font>

101
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,960
besides that possibly the autonomic

102
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:10,270
intense will overlap so it's necessary

103
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:15,010
some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mechanism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to for example</font>

104
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:18,549
resolve avoid conflicts or resolve<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

105
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:24,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">tents which have different needs next</font>

106
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:28,470
slide so as I thought before we restrict

107
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:32,050
our use case section<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going to</font>

108
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the examples that we have in</font>

109
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,390
this section in our draft so the first

110
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:42,159
one is one of maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

111
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:46,240
on on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> NEMA which is the prefix</font>

112
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,460
management it's a whole base intent so

113
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,460
this is most stunning cancer that can

114
00:08:51,510 --> 00:09:01,600
support the distribution of prefix in a

115
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,240
you know IP RAM and the thing to the

116
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">information of the way which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

117
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,209
intent is distributed<font color="#E5E5E5"> network can</font>

118
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,980
influence how the details of this prefix

119
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:17,770
will be addressed by the autonomic

120
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:20,500
nerves next slide the second one which

121
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:23,829
ones which is one of that has been

122
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed it in the mailing list is for</font>

123
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:28,779
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have to coordinate</font>

124
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,560
multiple intense so in this example we

125
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:34,660
have two statements to assertions the

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,170
first one is there should be enough

127
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:41,699
hosts to keep cpu utilization less than

128
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:44,469
seventy percent and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one</font>

129
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,350
intent which is there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

130
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:51,700
hosts part so that electricity isn't

131
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:56,410
wasted and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the pole tents view</font>

132
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:59,380
influence the way that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia which is</font>

133
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible to control the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

134
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">house which are part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the network is</font>

135
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:10,510
influenced it so it's necessary to have

136
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,939
function that decides what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> best for</font>

137
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so in this case the first</font>

138
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font>

139
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,800
or in other words it's more important to

140
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:24,459
have enough host to keep CP<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilization</font>

141
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:28,060
less than seventy percent then to save

142
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,520
electricity so but of course some

143
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:36,640
element or some function in the network

144
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:39,160
it must decide that and also it's

145
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,970

146
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">network coordinate to ensure that this</font>

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:53,770
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternate or behaves in a</font>

148
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:55,810
constant way next the third use case in

149
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,569
this case we consider a metropolitan

150
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:04,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network domain in the car network domain</font>

151
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:07,410
and the for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> metropolitan domain some</font>

152
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:11,260
operator a defines an intent to minimize

153
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,540
the link load<font color="#E5E5E5"> variance and for the core</font>

154
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,920
network your parade he<font color="#CCCCCC"> applies the</font>

155
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:21,670
previews intent and to activate load

156
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,469
balance if the load<font color="#E5E5E5"> is superior to 1.6</font>

157
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,469
on more than thirty percent of the links

158
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:34,420
it's like okay beside these cases we

159
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,290
also add some information on intent

160
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,459
distribution and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image</font>

161
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,930
mechanisms for distribution of intent

162
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:48,130
are as we as was discussing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

163
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:50,439
grasp and also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACP besides that</font>

164
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,230
there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a discussion on the least</font>

165
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,770
about some kinds of form of floating in

166
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,950
the network maybe some food which is

167
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:03,490
restrain it or constrain it using some

168
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:09,540
kind of anime information or other ways

169
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:09,540
to originate the the floating next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:21,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this topic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of intent distribution</font>

171
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:25,600
and the examples of intent are I have

172
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:27,790
active discussions on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">some questions and examples are</font>

174
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,500
summarized in the next slide so one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the objectives of the presentation is to</font>

176
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:40,450
bring the questions and try to promote

177
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:43,930
the discussion which has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> take place</font>

178
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:47,709
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also to collect</font>

179
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:50,680
feedback so the target is to read some

180
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,079
common understanding and also to

181
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,859
document some parts of the intent which

182
00:12:53,079 --> 00:13:00,880
are not at this time covered in other

183
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,980
documents it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

184
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,649
questions and I think this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

185
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:10,209
important slide of this presentation are

186
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:12,730
some questions that we as the outers of

187
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,069
the draft we discuss it internally and

188
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,709
we think that are important to put

189
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:21,670
further need an email which<font color="#CCCCCC"> are first</font>

who writes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enhance second how many</font>

192
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,180
that how many domains and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

193
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,459
is important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's also</font>

194
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,719

195
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:44,260
Anna autonomic domain and for now we

196
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,930
define an autonomic de miedo<font color="#CCCCCC"> may as the</font>

197
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">nodes that have to to respect a certain</font>

198
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:57,010
intent so it's kind of you know like a

199
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,890
circular definition what are the intent

200
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:03,370
levels<font color="#CCCCCC"> hierarchy and this is related</font>

00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the need for translations and</font>

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,600
what is intended process and compiled so

205
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:22,899
it's an author of<font color="#E5E5E5"> confusion or there are</font>

206
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,959
some some well-known points elements a B

208
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:35,290
such tasks next question is

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">floating so if you are bringing food for</font>

210
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:40,569
this for distribution are intense how to

211
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,439
be made it's an said to have some

212
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:50,439
constraints or how this how<font color="#E5E5E5"> disease we</font>

213
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:53,769
work on iace the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how is</font>

214
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:55,748
it that understood by node or an Asia so

215
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,179
it's also important to understand that

216
00:14:55,749 --> 00:15:00,279
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> considering some kind of</font>

217
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,819
heterogeneity on the track domain

218
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:07,989
probably have some constraint devices

219
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:09,849
along with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> powerful devices so they</font>

220
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,920
can have they can have different

221
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,689
capabilities in order to process they

222
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,399
dance and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannon aiza right</font>

223
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:21,059
unidentified not easy so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font>

224
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,850
important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have for example</font>

225
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:29,049
intense that can cross for different

226
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:35,290
functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also that it it could</font>

227
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:38,019
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen next so as an examples</font>

228
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:43,269
of intent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that this is this</font>

229
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:44,799
probably is not consensus but we are

230
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,839
different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that it's</font>

231
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,720
broadly you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

232
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:52,029
different kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstraction that we</font>

233
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,749
can use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> events so for example have a</font>

234
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:58,600
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very light hi abstraction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

235
00:15:55,749 --> 00:16:01,860
do the right thing and probably this is

236
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">very difficult for network to to address</font>

237
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,629
this contest also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone in that</font>

238
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,379
that could be free the network

239
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:15,540
enrollment that whitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> detected it's</font>

240
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:18,069
being disgusted in the mailing list a

241
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,339
another example that I i mentioned

242
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:23,589
before arrange vm quiescence tribution

243
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:26,529
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap utilization is below</font>

244
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,809
seventy percent which is more we

245
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:30,970
decrease the level of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other state</font>

246
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:34,660
which is necessary for our elements to

247
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,899
process this<font color="#E5E5E5"> intent assigned to fix is</font>

248
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:41,969
to brand<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes it's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well known an</font>

249
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:44,440
example of intent another one is

250
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,640
protecting you users traffic

251
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,650
you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of a</font>

252
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:53,050
prioritization for different kinds of

253
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,780
users in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network and this could affect</font>

254
00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:00,040
different services different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

255
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,410
traffic on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and also anything</font>

256
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've mentioned before to maximize</font>

257
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:08,349
energy savings and probably this kind of

258
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,530
intent must be compulsively differently

259
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:14,260
ends in order to preserve some heart

260
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,599
risks of the network the prioritization

261
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:22,569
of the traffic so probably will be

262
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:24,879
necessary to have so probably it will be

263
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary to have another information</font>

264
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,550
others information for network in order

265
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:35,740
to compose how that or good behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

266
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:40,530
order to maximize energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> savings so I</font>

267
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:44,140
think that dreamers representation and

268
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,600
just as a final note I think the most

269
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,360
important part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions and of</font>

270
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:53,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there are lots of such questions</font>

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,080
that are not answered at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this time so</font>

272
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:58,360
thanks Jeff is Michael Berenger can you

273
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:05,189
call two slides three slices but now I

274
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">think no one law or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mo no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm mr. sorry</font>

275
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,640
it did with the numbered lists that the

276
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:13,840
number list there was one item with all

277
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,270
the same questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows yes this one's</font>

278
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,000
number eight weeks clarified i think

279
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">intend always comes not from an a sa it</font>

280
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,390
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a human operator i think that</font>

281
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,360
is the one where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have very clear</font>

282
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:29,800
consensus the other ones we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are starting</font>

283
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:33,820
a convert just a general comment we are

284
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,830
risking in trying to please everything

285
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,730
and everybody and making this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing blow</font>

286
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:42,010
out of all proportion<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

287
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:45,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do and and so everybody comes up</font>

288
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:49,600
with cases that are somehow justified

289
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:51,310
right hey every time I I I every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time I</font>

290
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,320
respond to something I don't think what

291
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,690
can I say against it well you can't read

292
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to fall to everything in</font>

293
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,960
one go it's going to be a huge piece

294
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,179
that they're trying

295
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,390
yeah but i would encourage us to think

296
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what is the minimum we can</font>

297
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:09,450
start with do the minimum right now

298
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,679
knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to go from there I'll make</font>

299
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same comment after the next</font>

300
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation as it yeah I think that</font>

301
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,178
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to answer that this draft is is</font>

302
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,309
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's my personal view that is</font>

303
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,870
going towards what you are mentioned

304
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:30,000
Michael so we are looking for simplify

305
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:33,299
they use cases and how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

306
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,909
addressing the network and the last

307
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:39,000
direction and the last version of the

308
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:41,309
draft which has some some new additions

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,110
I think they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going towards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

310
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:46,740
direction but the completed review that

311
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:53,209
we have to to maintain a simple in order

312
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:57,750
to to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> marker sees proposal chain</font>

313
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:00,090
individual appear news without my chair

314
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">had an actor named Michael I have</font>

315
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,510
slightly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know different opinion</font>

316
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:10,890
against yours because I I think you know

317
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:15,029
for now this work is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know really</font>

318
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:18,360
chartered for the working group so that

319
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:22,620
actually we had enough time to carry

320
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:26,039
enough information and what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

321
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,149
do what we did actually for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you</font>

322
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:33,120
know autonomic network to be able to run

323
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:36,029
so no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> its you know named intent</font>

324
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,000
or name did something else like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

325
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:44,700
prime meter for automobile service agent

326
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,240
whatever I mean my study see is we can

327
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:52,320
you know describe all the information

328
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:57,510
between the adhan<font color="#E5E5E5"> lankan agent you know</font>

329
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:01,950
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> autonomic notes and either that's</font>

330
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:06,090
Paula sale or Panthers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know start</font>

331
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,450
getting get off them into one document

332
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:15,480
then try to

333
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:18,030
get kids in class fight afterwards we

334
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,760
limit you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe that the top why is</font>

335
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">lampy intent the the lower one named</font>

336
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,430
perimeter whatever so the most

337
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,669
importantly is you know how you know

338
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:33,150
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information needs to be changed</font>

339
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:37,680
here with you know because they are bunk

340
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:43,640
nodes where we need tips most of them if

341
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:46,410
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of them Michael Berenger so I</font>

342
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why on the</font>

343
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,800
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going back and forth and</font>

344
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,050
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth and back and forth that</font>

345
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,389
disagree and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do agree is because we</font>

346
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,030
don't agree on the naming yeah right and

347
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:59,970
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to describe</font>

348
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:01,350
what we mean then I think it would make

349
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,120
things a lot easier so i would suggest

350
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:07,290
let's try to get this name right as soon

351
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">as possible and did the thing with with</font>

352
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,090
all this naming<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we actually mean</font>

353
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,900
all the same thing we just call it

354
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">different bits and therefore i have this</font>

355
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,250
funny suspicion that there is no

356
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,379
difference in our views really right

357
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,210
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you call something like that</font>

358
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,730
and that triggers are the wrong reaction

359
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,530
on me and vice versa probably so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

360
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,420
argue let's get the naming sold it as

361
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,960
soon as we can so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what we</font>

362
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,350
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fine not fine i guess</font>

363
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,440
you know just keep you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss that</font>

364
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:45,060
in the meanest then whatever it contents

365
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:48,500
we got the put into the draft yeah and

366
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:52,020
don't feel you know pressure on you know

367
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,170
untie<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because so far it's not the</font>

368
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,840
working group now stone yet so wait we

369
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:01,980
don't have them in a timely limited to

370
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,419
do that yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets sons right no no we're</font>

371
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:09,000
continue or<font color="#E5E5E5"> condone this document but i</font>

372
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,340
feel that mail and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know we she did the</font>

373
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,430
document in an intentional out in the in

374
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:17,909
the current charter but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

375
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,800
probably ending in all of the documents

376
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,150
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submission to intent so</font>

377
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,509
probably we have some government at

378
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,089
least two if

379
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:28,779
on which is a nanny my intent and some

380
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:31,389
so probably you be necessary and I don't

381
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:38,459
know if the current format of the draft

382
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:41,769
is the the best one to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green</font>

383
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:45,070
for me the working group already issue a

384
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:49,629
great interest in to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

385
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:52,570
know work then that's just the matter of

386
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:56,259
the recharter to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to equal in</font>

387
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:59,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I I have no doubt you know we we</font>

388
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:02,019
can do that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group but be</font>

389
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:04,689
aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we want is on</font>

390
00:24:02,019 --> 00:24:07,829
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of autonomic network infrastructure</font>

391
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:11,949
so there could be some in a generic

392
00:24:07,829 --> 00:24:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">intent but if you talk about generally</font>

393
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:17,109
intent that made out of this scope of

394
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:19,989
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> the this working group but</font>

395
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:23,109
if we're talking about the the intent

396
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:26,169
for the autonomic network that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

397
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:30,158
know each other but mean just not be a

398
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:33,159
master yet we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would you know definitely</font>

399
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:40,479
include that in the next charter i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

400
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:44,859
if we got approved<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

401

be next the max Col Richardson has a

402
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:49,149

night just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan is</font>

434
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:01,140
working Noreen<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah right hello</font>

435
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,320
everywhere yeah we can hear you so yo

436
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,890
gets the mic so let's bring up the

437
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,549
slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so that's that's a</font>

438
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:15,090
coordination is that you want

439
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:17,580
coordination<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's double that ok so</font>

440
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,549
a light one so this presentation is

441
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,809
about autonomic<font color="#CCCCCC"> function coordination</font>

442
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:28,679
there isn't a date of the draft can you

443
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:31,049
go next slide please thank you so just a

444
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,090
bit of background this topic has already

445
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:37,620
been presented in dallas and frag and

446
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,020
you also can find a reference on that

447
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,229
works in section 9 of the animal

448
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:43,179
reference mother

449
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,240
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss with you</font>

450
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,460
today is I like the problem the game

451
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to put everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the same page</font>

452
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:55,390
and discuss a link with intent I follow

453
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">the discussion it's not to reopen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

454
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:01,360
discussion but see if there is any

455
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,750
aspect that should be done with a in

456
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,969
debt<font color="#CCCCCC"> so why do we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to coordinate so</font>

457
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:11,049
the picture you can see on the slide is

458
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,260
a interaction among a set of autonomic

459
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:16,360
functions as we have a set of parameters

460
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,450
controls<font color="#CCCCCC"> matrix that will make an</font>

461
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,659
interplay and it's quite complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I</font>

462
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:26,140
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interaction and what to</font>

463
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,390
control that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interaction map so the</font>

464
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:36,130
interaction that I have complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> X like</font>

465
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:38,740
this and there are different types of

466
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,390
interactions you can have conflicting

467
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,010
types of interactions which is

468
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:45,490
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we would try to solve</font>

469
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:47,890
but you can have also can promote

470
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,900
cooperation and also dependency

471
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,809
dependence in the sense that Constance

472
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,870
an autonomy function cannot work if

473
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,520
another one is not already operating

474
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,610
this is different type of interaction we

475
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,240
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover the direction also complex</font>

476
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,678
summarized by humans or set of freedom

477
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,070
essentially because of the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

478
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,380
have thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different functions</font>

479
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,960
distributed in the network the speed of

480
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the operation if we measure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enzyme</font>

481
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:20,140
interaction very difficult for human to

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,450
track at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when sense milliseconds</font>

484
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">behaviors and also it's a requirement to</font>

485
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,860
assist the human with tools or algorithm

486
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,230
that can help to identify I eat and

487
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,379
appearances Eden links between the

488
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:41,230
interaction because things are not abuse

489
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,419
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a good model so in the</font>

490
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,870
proposal what we put forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">working group in the next items will be</font>

492
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,539
to be able to coordinate the collector

493
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:55,010
thanks to a command function that will

494
00:29:53,539 --> 00:30:02,660
be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the automatic</font>

496
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,970
sketch of the solutions it is regular

497
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,700
draft I mean so the common coordination

498
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,210
function provides means to achieve local

499
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:17,480
and global<font color="#CCCCCC"> stability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conversions it's a</font>

500
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:20,000
reusable component in that it is

501
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that atomic functions will not</font>

502
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,299
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a lot and to repeat it is</font>

503
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,760
useful at different phases for the

506
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,020
importantly at runtime and we can

<font color="#E5E5E5">support multiple strategies it's a file</font>

type of algorithm to solve different

509
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,280
type of coordination problems he's not

510

<font color="#E5E5E5">only a hammer we have in our toolbox and</font>

511
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:52,399
to realize that there is no requirement

512
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,799
especially in terms of adding a common

513
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,289
description or a commanding manifest for

514

an essential feature of coordination to

seen as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logically social entity that</font>

we use the reserve such<font color="#CCCCCC"> constraints the</font>

and also the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> bismol algorithmic</font>

533
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:05,449
it's not a fixed component the

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,970
coordination function also<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a higher</font>

00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,800
level view on the operation it's not

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:12,980
only the autonomic function which has a

of the collective behavior of the system

for the Coordination strategy at the

network level don't eat in form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

549
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:52,100
an intense from higher level like for

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,620
the inputs of an OSS or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human</font>

551
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">operator that we say the coordination</font>

552
00:32:54,620 --> 00:33:00,500
strategy I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I want combined network</font>

553
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,229
that former oh yeah that's the goal i am

554
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:07,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for through the state operation</font>

555
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:11,060
of my network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the other aspect on</font>

556
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:13,760
the salon owner level is can the

557
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,780
coordination function also expressed

558
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,900
intent policy after work order autonomic

559
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,540
functions<font color="#CCCCCC"> or order Nikki understands</font>

560
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:28,010
that if the coordination function detect

561
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:30,440
also instance from each behavior instead

562
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,540
of changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters of this</font>

563
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,090
function you can just say this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

564
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,610
new goal you need to reach and up to the

565
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,760
autonomic functions to adapt attached to

566
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,219
what is intended goal but this is really

567
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,770
something open for discussion and if you

568
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,830
are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss we are I got to</font>

569
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:59,710
pick up with you I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lock</font>

570
00:33:48,830 --> 00:34:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">right back up hello Michael Pena here a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level I understand what you're</font>

00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:12,768
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> having enormous</font>

574
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:16,069
to see how we can start with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

575
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:19,598
you help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us understand what a maybe a</font>

576
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:22,579
good example would be and what a minimal

577
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,289
policy engine would look like in other

578
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:26,179
words can we start somewhere really

579
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:27,679
really small and understand it better

580
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:32,869
make brokers from there that would help

581
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:37,730
me tremendously yeah for sure I think as

582
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:41,690
we have discussed on the many ways what

583
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:47,119
the heck would I hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything I have a</font>

584
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:52,849

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:55,339
merging in a need for Policy and is

00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:58,730
composed of different from photo itself

587
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:01,849
or you input the employee or<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

589
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:09,529

593
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:21,619
some example we can discuss offline but

594
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,808
what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a form of a involved for</font>

595
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,609
initial strategy right now it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

596
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:30,819
difficult to expenses that i will buy a

robot we can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it offline finish</font>

598
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:51,520
ok let's continue with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> naran ok this</font>

599
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:56,530
way already<font color="#CCCCCC"> here ok knowledge ok so the</font>

600
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,290
second presentation is a highlight how

601
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:03,000
we could exchange knowledge information

602
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in economic networks next slide please</font>

603
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:19,118
ok so the French sentence and say is for

604
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:21,160
saga to conform I californica as you so

605
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,980
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it in a scope of autonomy</font>

606
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,960
cataracts and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> English we can transfer</font>

607
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:29,079
that into the ability to exchange

608
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,200
information among those to understand

609
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:34,359
the context to make decision and take

610
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,450
appropriate action right on this

611
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:39,670

615
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,710
important to exchange knowledge in a

616
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:59,349
public network first because<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovery</font>

617
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:02,410
is not about it one can only discover

618
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:04,240
something that'll rejection and a key

619
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,368
characteristic of economic system is

620
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they learn new knowledge from the</font>

621
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:11,680
environment using computation and

622
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,649
insurance and so their knowledge Bailey

654
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:59,649
interval fashion next like this so in

655
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:02,890
the draft we have sketch a solution that

656
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:05,140
is used to manage the exchange and

657
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:10,210
processing on information between

658
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:13,029
autonomic functions the solution

659
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,950
provides also a unified interface for

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> management of information flows the</font>

common mechanism that discovered in the

663
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,000
draft and also the embedded protocol is

664
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,220
used to negotiate and automatically

665
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,200
adapt based on the different

666
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,540
capabilities or requirements of the pats

PC Party speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> entities so it's also</font>

668
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,930
relative protocols that can tune the

671
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:58,020
this one should be another next one like

672
00:39:50,820 --> 00:40:00,990
realistic speed so the draft provides

673
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:05,160
more details on the realization of such

674
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:07,319

00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:19,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that the aspect of knowledge exchange</font>

00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:58,200
managing information and constant

information in the distributed system

695
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:04,710
but also the distribution of information

696
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:06,660
among the different entities and the

optimization of all the flaws among

698
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,930
again there is a specific component that

699
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:14,700
is developed to optimize how the

700
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,980
different entities communicate

701
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,919
information on a regular basis or

702
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,830

is to serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a basis for further study</font>

706
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,520
and discussion the group and we are

00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">really open to discuss with people</font>

710
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:07,089
no get home yeah be it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yeah</font>

711
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:10,869
Laurent is being I am I think and in

712
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:13,750
general the concept of information

713
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:18,119
exchange is very available and that is

714
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:20,770
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons why we rename the</font>

715
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,800
distribute distribution draft from

716
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:26,109

718
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:32,880
right now yeah yeah because we thought

719
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:35,230
always in 10 there must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be many other</font>

00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:47,160
exchanged between<font color="#E5E5E5"> what naughty notes but</font>

722
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:49,720
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is are you propose a new</font>

723
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:55,500
protocol dedicated for knowledge

724
00:42:49,720 --> 00:43:01,919
exchange or do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is possible to</font>

725
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:01,920
make the knowledge exchange over grasp

00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:18,240
can lauren lauren if you want to you

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer a question you have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

731
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:44,370

736
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:07,350
network gets when big was asking a

737
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:11,010
question so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can hear it hello do I</font>

738
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:15,120
need to repeat my question yes be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

739
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:18,240
my question is for the knowledge

740
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:20,569
exchange are you proposing a new

741
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,490
protocol dedicated for this purpose or

742
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:28,170
you possibly think across the

743
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:33,120
information exchange could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be also ran</font>

744
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:35,910
over clasp<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so far I think both</font>

745
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:40,790
options are possible I think graphs can

746
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:45,149
fit the part of the requirement but the

747
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:46,950
mine my my knowledge today is that the

748
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,300
knowledge section the type of knowledge

749
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,810
or information that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be exchanged</font>

750
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,140
among public entities can be beyond what

751
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:57,210
grasp is currently considering

752
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:00,810
especially because there is a hardest

753
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:04,560
aspect of we actually qualifying

754
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:07,230
information grasp is is compared was

755
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,500
agnostic to the type of content is

756
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:12,510
tearing and it's fine like that but if

757
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:16,440
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go one step further in the</font>

758
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:18,920
processing of information exchange we

759
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,650
need to put additional star

760
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:25,069
in the design of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font>

761
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:28,180
exchange and so we may have to extend

762
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:31,250
either the grass or of after layer

763
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:34,009
mechanism that use our use on top of

764
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,770
rust in what we have done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far from</font>

765
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,000
the specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the typing we</font>

766
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,710
have used something completely different

767
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,140
and we have the load very different

768
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:47,180
communication schemes to be a to be

769
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,710
deployed at<font color="#CCCCCC"> runtime for you depending on</font>

770
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,660
the needs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the functions some</font>

771
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:53,540
functions we need to have broadcasting

772
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:55,009
order function we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

773
00:45:53,540 --> 00:46:01,069
functions we need to have point-to-point

774
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:05,829
communication so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

775
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:09,558
done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

776
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:13,040
good that you can sort or to some

777
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:15,859
specific requirements and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

778
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,109
can also consider whether this new

779
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:21,940
requirement can be fixed could be

780
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:24,710
covered by the distribution mechanism

781
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:33,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Thanks ok ok we work together on that</font>

782
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:36,559
thank you i love them now after ok this

783
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,439
is Jefferson speaking um my questions is

784
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,380
similar to the previous one but about

785
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data models because you mentioning</font>

786
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:49,869
in this discussion is lied about several

787
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:53,029
forms of information like Montori

788
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:57,950
measurement and so forth and that there

789
00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:02,089
are some current data models for that so

790
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:08,899
my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pinky give</font>

791
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:12,650
all you baby yeah

792
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:16,340
so yeah if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hearing my question</font>

793
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:18,710
is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> considering to integrate</font>

794
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,600
to merge the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current data models</font>

795
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:25,880
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new ones that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

796
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:28,730
deploy or is a clean slate approach to

797
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:38,240
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information in the autonomic</font>

798
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:40,490
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay since he's been disabled if</font>

799
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,229
he's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore that we can maybe</font>

800
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:47,689
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list as well</font>

801
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:50,630
yeah yeah let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for next topic yeah</font>

802
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:54,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets the discussing on the PA here</font>

803
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:58,730
what's the talk yeah yeah he had a

804
00:47:54,070 --> 00:48:01,010
plantation to go yeah yeah but if you

805
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:05,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">hear me I could also try to provide a</font>

806
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:09,020
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jefferson question</font>

807
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:15,200
can you a nap yeah we can hear you up

808
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:17,930
here actually we have only 12 minutes to

809
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:22,120
go so we have to run taking probably

810
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:27,560
which would like to at least finish one

811
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:29,569
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there I already so you prefer</font>

812
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:33,110
you your research into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation</font>

813
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:38,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question to the list okay and is</font>

814
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:43,390
that right yeah ok so this presentation

815
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:45,940
areas refreshment on the draft on

816
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:49,009
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about autonomic functions and</font>

817
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:52,420
most specifically about I<font color="#CCCCCC"> aiza</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

818
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,420
move to the next slide please

819
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:02,180
so the motivations are I've not changed

820
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,370
since the since November meeting and

821
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,700
they still are<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve the network</font>

822
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:11,299
operation and today we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

823
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:13,640
do this route on amex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font>

824
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,500
during the previous session that there's

825
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,350
a lot of work going on on how we can

826
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,840
start to terminal autonomic nodes but

827
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,819
there's still many questions about how

828
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get these autonomic functions that</font>

829
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:27,980
are brought to live inside his autonomic

830
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:31,700
node and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can control them and in</font>

831
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that operators will have trusting</font>

832
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,109
what happens there so that's why we

833
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,540
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some common management</font>

834
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:40,340
functions which are transverse to these

835
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:43,130
autonomic functions into these autonomic

836
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,160
notes can help in this so I think law as

837
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:49,130
presented previously a bit some of these

838
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,390
ideas of<font color="#CCCCCC"> command</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> management functions</font>

839
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:56,390
like the coordination the knowledge

840
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:58,759
point of view so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all</font>

841
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:04,490
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this direction and we also believe</font>

842
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:07,600
that the intense are a good way to help

843
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:11,359
into this if we move to next slide

844
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:16,779
you'll see there that on the status

845
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:19,790
between version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 00 and version 01 years</font>

846
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:23,030
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically announced and</font>

847
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:28,210
make it more visible which is targeted

848
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:28,210
to the current work items of animal and

849
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:34,240
we have so then documented some

850
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:37,430
requested extensions to grasp and

851
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:41,120
identified some items for the for the

852
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:45,040
reference model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go click quickly</font>

853
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:50,779
to them to the latest point cause it's

854
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:53,390
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he has a bit more freely</font>

855
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say a second phase of an in my</font>

856
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:59,450
work so if you move to next slide I

857
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:01,270
think you can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> move by two if you</font>

858
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,098
want to be fast

859
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:05,869
so this it's really how to control I

860
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:08,359
aiza so that means what is their life

861
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:10,520
cycle so in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to explaining a bit</font>

862
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:15,500
this life cycle which is a proposition

863
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:19,280
for having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> czar but ok dearly as it is</font>

864
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:22,099
a proposition it is details technically

865
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,440
it's one solution that can be others

866
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:27,589
what is important is that we keep in

867
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,420
mind that da czar will have a given life

868
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:32,180
cycle that will grow through

869
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:35,359
installation and reach a point where

870
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:38,210
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real operational and the</font>

871
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,460
I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be possibly</font>

872
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:43,190
a good idea to get this inside the

873
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:46,190
reference model in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

874
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:49,039
to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a companion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the section</font>

875
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,599
where there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big de lifecycle or</font>

876
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,630
something like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle of an</font>

877
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:55,609
autonomic know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go it how it</font>

878
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,650
starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and all these things so this</font>

879
00:51:55,609 --> 00:52:03,348
illustrative or part that michael

880
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:07,430
explained on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> monday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um recession so</font>

881
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:16,420
now moving to next slide we got bit more

882
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:20,000
to grasp things so this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

883
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:24,109
providing today's picture of we having a

884
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zardoz aiza are controlling inside the</font>

885
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:27,470
autonomic notes they're controlling

886
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:29,899
through either netcom of SNMP or

887
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:33,230
whatever they're controlling the network

888
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:36,170
equipment the autonomic node and which

889
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:39,410
itself as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> grasp engine and an ACP and</font>

890
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:42,770
shine more likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grasp and join over</font>

891
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ACP and shine and communication</font>

892
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:49,160
between these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASA is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening through</font>

893
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:52,029
grasp so we think also that we have to

894
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,170
integrate inside the scheme there's

895
00:52:52,029 --> 00:53:00,589
management functions we've been talking

896
00:52:54,170 --> 00:53:04,010
about namely coordination a bit of the

897
00:53:00,589 --> 00:53:09,799
kind of intent distributor of intent

898
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:11,510
handler<font color="#CCCCCC"> em and and the knowledge so this</font>

899
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:14,600
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

900
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:17,780
to harmonize the way these autonomic

901
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:20,360
functions will work the one with the

902
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:32,330
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> m to make sure they will not miss</font>

903
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:35,420
the network next slide please so here we

904
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:38,840
still have two points that are think for

905
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:40,850
that can be addressed quite easily well

906
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,640
quite quickly it is first we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

907
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,770
control when the nays<font color="#CCCCCC"> are runs and now</font>

908
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,560
he trends and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know what it</font>

909
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:52,430
does to the network so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

910
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,440
main<font color="#E5E5E5"> points we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can keep for later the</font>

911
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,270
fact of deciding which equipments are

912
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,090
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nays</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are control especially</font>

913
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:01,400
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the problem in scenarios a</font>

914
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,590
bit more complex than than the one

915
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,040
considered for today so next slide

916
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:10,700
please in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minimal</font>

917
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,700
control of neza we need at least to be

918
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to start and stop this one so the</font>

919
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,970
solution would be to sentence<font color="#CCCCCC"> start/stop</font>

920
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:23,150
coming next slide with grasp and so

921
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:27,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're next slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Poseidon</font>

922
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:30,350
yeah so it's that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would need to</font>

923
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:32,450
have a new possibly a new imperative a

924
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:35,810
new type of message which would be an

925
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:38,270
imperative command type of message we've

926
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:41,029
provided inside the drafter suggested

927
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:47,840
from for this imperative message next

928
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:49,820
slide then if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know what a</font>

929
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:53,120
nazar does to the network we need to

930
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:57,500
know which network resources are

931
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:59,240
modified by nazar control loop and also

932
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,470
to know which network resources are

933
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:06,500
monitored by your nazar control loop

934
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:08,299
that gives two things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> give some</font>

935
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,940
information to an operator that would

936
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:13,310
like to know what a nazar does to the

937
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">network you would know which is which</font>

938
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:21,259
are the inputs and the outputs of this

939
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:23,450
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this algorithm and it is very</font>

940
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,310
important in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect conflicts</font>

941
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:28,669
between different<font color="#E5E5E5"> aiza that would be</font>

942
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:31,690
complete over something so the solution

943
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:36,470
for this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to disclose nazar manifest</font>

944
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:39,710
at as a bootstrap time so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move to</font>

945
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,560
next slide we would suggest this to

946
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:44,650
happen through<font color="#E5E5E5"> grasp discovery message</font>

947
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:48,680
and we have here two different options

948
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 would be to consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the world</font>

949
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:54,259
man what we named and manifest that is

950
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:58,160
basically containing all these

951
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:59,900
information before so we would discuss

952
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,379
all the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a neza in a</font>

953
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:05,150
single discovery message or otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

954
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,490
would for each of these atomic

955
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:13,250
information and different discovery

956
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:17,689
message by grasp<font color="#E5E5E5"> mmm so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

957
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:21,470
options<font color="#CCCCCC"> read so here it's the end of the</font>

958
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:24,710
presentation and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to move</font>

959
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:27,649
to next to the final slide we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

960
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:34,070
conclude on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah and them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

961
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:36,530
you have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions or comments did I</font>

962
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:41,170
did I miss the sea last line which

963
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:44,210
devices at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a-si controls was the</font>

964
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,730
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short this</font>

965
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">time I just got rid out I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got this</font>

966
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:53,330
off but but we will unless there is

967
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:55,279
still part of your design considerations

968
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:57,770
just running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah yeah</font>

969
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,560
but I thought do this point would be a

970
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:06,259
bit more complex to tackle in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the short</font>

971
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:11,150
term we<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for the presentation I kept</font>

972
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:15,440
it aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks yes hello Pierre</font>

973
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:23,180
listening yeah I could you go back to

974
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:27,230
slide 12 yes in my understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

975
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:29,899
difficult to add such kind of more

976
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:33,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">information in the discovery because the</font>

977
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:35,690
cross discovery totally a label very

978
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:38,098
flexible data structure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

979
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:41,970
encapsulated in the

980
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:44,640
is a discovery or response message so in

981
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:49,680
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view is not very difficult</font>

982
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:56,940
and for the and could you go to the

983
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:58,890
slide 10 in the message concentration<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

984
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:02,759
think it's also not difficult to as such

985
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:07,288
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of message but the essential a</font>

986
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:10,289
problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

987
00:58:07,289 --> 00:58:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">not only regarding to grasp interactions</font>

988
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:19,529
it's more related to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lasers behavior</font>

989
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:23,190
I don't know whether it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to allow</font>

990
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:28,109
one easy to control the the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM</font>

991
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:31,400
maybe there's some very little security

992
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:34,109
considerations it's maybe it's risky to

993
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:38,940
allow one easier to control the other

994
00:58:34,109 --> 00:58:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">aiza so so ever in my point of view this</font>

995
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:45,259
is not recording and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only regarding</font>

996
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:52,039
to the growth is maybe even more are

997
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:52,039
related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference model what what</font>

998
00:58:52,279 --> 00:59:04,650
do you want Michael do you want to speak

999
00:58:55,289 --> 00:59:06,499
her may answer now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncle yeah I find</font>

1000
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:10,920
your your point very interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1001
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:14,879
you know cause I mean regarding whether

1002
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:18,329
it is a nazar design or whether it is a

1003
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:22,289
grass point of view I think Oh draft is

1004
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:25,380
really addressing this as the main topic

1005
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:29,009
of the draft is Asia and Asia behavior

1006
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:31,140
and whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some management</font>

1007
00:59:29,009 --> 00:59:35,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">functions which can be considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

1008
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:39,509
very specific Asia which has four unique

1009
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:42,930
role to control this ecosystem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Azon</font>

1010
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:47,340
provides on some control over it so

1011
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:50,100
that's possibly yeah that's that's

1012
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:52,050
in my opinion and design choice that we

1013
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,670
have to make and they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

1014
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:55,980
more happy if these design choice would

1015
00:59:53,670 --> 01:00:01,680
have been made a bit earlier in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1016

1018
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:14,160
know what azar how they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1019
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:19,230
controlled and if they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1020
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:21,690
controlled yeah tell us so you know I

1021
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:24,600
mean to me it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to be</font>

1022
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,370
some aces that are up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1023
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,290
beginning which are the ones that are

1024
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:30,540
doing you know the lifecycle management

1025
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:32,759
of the other aces right and I think

1026
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where basically your staff comes</font>

1027
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:38,010
in these cases would have the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASA</font>

1028
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,140
binary know the manifests and can

1029
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:45,830
install them where needed based on

1030
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:50,370
manifest information for example quick

1031
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:52,500
okay same same opinions tell us to me

1032
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:55,080
this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> special type of a sort of a</font>

1033
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,790
meta ASA if you want that<font color="#CCCCCC"> controls the</font>

1034
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:59,720
other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comment i actually wanted</font>

1035
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:03,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is about the knowledge plane</font>

1036
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:06,029
intersection<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not wrong right what</font>

1037
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:17,510
you do for is a coordination requires a

1038
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:20,280
knowledge plane really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bright yet what</font>

1039
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:28,440
difference what she considers the

1040
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:31,080
knowledge plane but yeah the truth sorry

1041
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:33,420
your presentation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> loans to be sound</font>

1042
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,090
like they attacked the same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1043
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:40,740
different angles if you want to register

1044
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a which parameters they touch then you</font>

1045
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:43,919
need to capture<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somewhere in</font>

1046
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:45,420
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be called the</font>

1047
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,800
knowledge plane so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the two are</font>

1048
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:51,810
related yeah yeah of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1049
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:56,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is rated and we use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

1050
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:57,900
coordination as well in any case but my

1051
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:59,220
culture killing me because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>
