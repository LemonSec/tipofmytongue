00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,049
I'm Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> eckle here at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF</font>

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,780
hackathon and just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:14,750
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the hackathon well the</font>

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,110
ITF it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> been about rough</font>

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,420
consensus and running code and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was seeing what</font>

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,530
others too is that perhaps has been a

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:27,740
little bit too much emphasis on the

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">rough consensus and not enough time</font>

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,430
spent on the running code part so what

11
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,110
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really trying to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

12
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,260
hackathon is bring that back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:39,680
balance I would say and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in doing so</font>

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,110
helped the ITF stay relevant really with

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of industry so what we're</font>

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing here is that in the ITF we</font>

17
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,050
develop standards and takes a while for

18
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,269
those standards to get defined and then

19
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,059
you get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on and implementing</font>

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,520
them but generally those tend to be a

21
00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,839
vendor specific proprietary

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,820
implementations you plug them together

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,399
and they don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> work well</font>

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,560
together not interoperable and that's

25
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:08,899
because there were perhaps some bugs and

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,759
the spec some ambiguities people

27
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:13,490
interpreted them differently and did

28
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,249
different things so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying</font>

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:18,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">to with the hackathon get into the habit</font>

30
00:01:16,249 --> 00:01:22,009
of implementing the code right in

31
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,869
parallel with the spec so you do some

32
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,609
implementation here that gets fed into

33
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,520
the spec you fix bugs that you find

34
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,649
there's a quick cycle that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">through with the idea being that in the</font>

36
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:35,779
end you end up with a better quality

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,369
spec<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets defined quicker and you</font>

38
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:39,709
have an open source implementation that

39
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a reference or just</font>

40
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:44,959
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use in their own products and</font>

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,369
solutions and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really seeing a lot</font>

42
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,200
of excitement around there we're seeing

43
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:51,590
great participation at the hackathon we

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,840
had 50 people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dallas we had 120</font>

45
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">signed up here in Prague and more than</font>

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,490
that actually attended and it's really

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">neat to see that nyx</font>

48
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,329
kind of new ideas coming in and the

49
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,189
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens with that where we</font>

50
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,960
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from different working</font>

51
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:06,669
groups or even different<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the open</font>

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,500
source community the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards community</font>

53
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,050
put them together<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a room getting to</font>

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,090
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working together and good stuff</font>

55
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,050
comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so to me that's one of</font>

56
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,500
the most exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that's</font>

happening
