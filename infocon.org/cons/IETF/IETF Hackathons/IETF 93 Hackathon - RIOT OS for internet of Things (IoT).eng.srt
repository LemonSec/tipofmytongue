00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,920
my name is Howie Peterson and I'm from

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,200
the free university in Berlin and I'm

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,660
also one of the riot team team core

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,090
developers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually my first</font>

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">time too I tff never been here and also</font>

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">my first time to the ITF hackathon then</font>

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,910
of course and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came here with quite a</font>

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,220
large group about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 people from</font>

9
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,289
the riot team and so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are hoping</font>

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,549
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to connect riot which is an</font>

11
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">operating system for very small</font>

12
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,168
constraint IOT devices to connect that

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,910
of course to other projects and

14
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:36,399
protocols that are going on at ITF and

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,129
so we have picked different<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics which</font>

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,350
we try to prepare it IDF and the one

17
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,440
topic I'm involved in currently is to

18
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,780
try to port the home net protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saudi</font>

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,089
NCP and agency p4 very constrained tiny

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,920
devices so we talked to the guys from

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,809
home Ned who are actually also<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font>

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,520
that's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice things about the</font>

23
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:56,079
hackathon that you just can connect to

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,750
all the people that basically made those

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,770
protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying to implement and</font>

26
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,199
talked a little bit with them and they

27
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,420
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's maybe not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their their core</font>

28
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,490
concern for the protocol to to have it

29
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">on those kind of devices we will we will</font>

30
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,810
try it anyway and see how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get and</font>

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,429
then kind of have a working version on

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,500
those systems we can evaluate for the

33
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,060
future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there might be room</font>

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,830
for improvement or other kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

35
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,380
profiles we would need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those kind of</font>

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices and kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if ever life they're</font>

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,130
more feasibility study in the end so

38
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:27,220
yeah and if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

39
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,600
riot just go to ride West org<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

40
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,158
you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course all the high-level</font>

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,408
information what riot what it's about

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,790
and but more importantly you find the

43
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,979
links to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get her where you find all of</font>

44
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,420
our code it's all open source also you

45
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,280
find the links<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our mailing list where</font>

46
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,840
you have a very very good starting point

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch with the community to</font>

48
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,110
get in touch with the people actually

49
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,780
who made the ideas who started

50
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,189
everything and so from there basically

51
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,290
you get all the information you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need and</font>

52
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:52,000
it's also a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> active community and</font>

53
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,920
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're focusing on very much</font>

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,570
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> these not only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical aspect</font>

55
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,490
but also the community aspect and then

56
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,829
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source idea behind it because</font>

57
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">in an hour would be strongly believe in</font>

58
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:04,570
is that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all these embedded</font>

59
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,310
tiny devices all around the world and

60
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,960
everywhere with like millions of things

61
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,640
or billions of things even in the

62
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet of Things and we only really</font>

63
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,750
can trust those devices if we have free

64
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,420
software which we can trust which we can

65
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,000
and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into and also of course free</font>

66
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,519
called an open protocol it's not free<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,750
it and and so that is the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and</font>

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why we're also pushing this idea</font>

69
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,590
put community so much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> only an</font>

70
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,450
open nice community can actually create

71
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,450
something that's open<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a nice ears</font>
