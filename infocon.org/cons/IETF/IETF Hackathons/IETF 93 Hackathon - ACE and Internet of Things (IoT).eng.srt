5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,170
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do is do authentication</font>

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and authorization to very tiny Internet</font>

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:26,010
of Things devices and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

8
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,470
door lock scenario so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,109
reuse a lot of existing technologies

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,379
that already exists so this phone

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually tries to it connects to server</font>

12
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,358
<font color="#CCCCCC">and authorization server it gets DSM web</font>

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,179
tokens and what we're working on today

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:45,960
is sending these tokens over ble to

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,329
these types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices and I just web</font>

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,280
token can then be verified here on this

17
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,679
device and a door lock<font color="#E5E5E5"> he could be</font>

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,629
opened so we are actually reusing a

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,690
number of IDF technologies that have

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:00,388
been working on in different groups

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:04,080
first we we work on OS use ours for the

22
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:06,180
authorization as Eric said we also use a

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,280
JSON web tokens from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> course a</font>

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,070
working group but we also tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed</font>

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,710
work back into the ongoing ADF face

26
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,839
working group which which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I co-chair to</font>

27
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,660
provide feedback about the feasibility

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,260
of some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mechanisms here</font>

29
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:24,240
are a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> example devices that we are</font>

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,090
using an hour in our death set all of

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">them are best setup all of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are arm</font>

32
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,360
cortex-m processes and those are in this

33
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,970
specific case we have a bluetooth smart

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,180
device that wait for incoming

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,870
connections authorization of requests

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,450
was a door<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock opening requests and</font>

37
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:48,630
then the scenario assumes that you are

38
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,170
basically connecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an adjacent</font>

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,199
device to have that interact with

40
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,450
back-end infrastructure there we again

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,790
we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of existing technology</font>

42
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,370
worked on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF core working group</font>

43
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

44
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,760
do the device management such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> co-op</font>

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,970
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the resource directory and</font>

46
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,730
so on and that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks to a</font>

47
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">scheme server which is not a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pair</font>

48
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,090
so where we define all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the doors and the</font>

49
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,090
things
