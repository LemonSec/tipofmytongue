175
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
do you see my screen

176
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,000
no

177
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,840
so i might have permission issues

178
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,960
yeah i gave the permission

179
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,120
no it seems like

180
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,519
mech i need to approve it somewhat so

181
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,839
um i'll try loading this slide let's let

182
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,480
phil go ahead since he's here now um and

183
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,399
we'll go back to our regularly scheduled

184
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
agenda

185
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,839
cool

186
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,480
phil you're up

187
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,680
we cannot hear you phil immediately

188
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,760
lots of technical difficulties today

189
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,720
i don't see you here muted phil see if

190
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,160
on your end if you can

191
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,160
reconnect

192
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
right i

193
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
it

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,239
just shows

195
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,359
i don't see any video i mean

196
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,519
yeah i don't see the option for audio

197
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,760
there

198
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
okay

199
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
phil you have to do the unmute your

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
audio if

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,959
i'm i guess that's probably the obvious

202
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
thing you may have already done that

203
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,040
can't hear you

204
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
yeah did you do that allow your browser

205
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
and all that when you first started

206
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,360
you shaking head you did yeah

207
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,160
still no voice phil

208
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
okay maybe he's

209
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,560
reconnecting

210
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
yes near do you want to go ahead i have

211
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,439
your slides up

212
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
go

213
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,120
okay

214
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
so a quick recap

215
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,440
and

216
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,880
rfc806 define the footprint types and

217
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,839
the object protein types uh

218
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,519
ipv4 or ipv6 idioms asn country code the

219
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,160
footing object is actually a

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,680
an object that allows to define uh

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,720
a bit of phototyping the values that the

222
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
client can match to

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
thank you uh

224
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
and rfc8008

225
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
allows to use this footment on a

226
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,320
footmate object uh to specify the k on

227
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,519
which a footprint each capability

228
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
uh is supported

229
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,480
so

230
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,519
in the

231
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,000
previous meetings in the previous

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
meeting we suggested two new footman

233
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
types expressed

234
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
the first is the

235
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,519
a

236
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,880
is a 31131662

237
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,360
a code which is a

238
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
the subdivision code

239
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,040
for example states in the us and which

240
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,600
this footing type publicly gives us a

241
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,760
better granularity compared to country

242
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
code

243
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,279
next

244
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,440
and the second and second fifty type was

245
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
the footprint union

246
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,120
that allows the

247
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,320
that introduced a did additive semantics

248
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
between different footprint types

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,600
and that's it the

250
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
internet draft with several comments and

251
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,560
thank you kevin for

252
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
start the shepherd review on the

253
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
on the draft

254
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
and

255
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
there's

256
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,600
no more action items i'm aware of so

257
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
and and nothing new to

258
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,440
to bring up here

259
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
if you this slides actually point to the

260
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,839
to the left

261
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
draft why would they be happy if we can

262
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,440
proceed to the less goal of this uh

263
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
thank you

264
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,279
yeah i think this one's pretty

265
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,680
straightforward uh it's just registering

266
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,120
two new um footprint types in the iona

267
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
registry we've talked about it for a

268
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,040
little while now it's i don't think

269
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,519
there's been any contention about it

270
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,680
i went ahead and did my shepard

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,880
pre-review as is our custom

272
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,160
um i think once assuming that all those

273
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
were addressed we're probably in pretty

274
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
good shape i don't know if anyone has

275
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,040
any objections to us moving this forward

276
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
to a working group last call

277
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,680
if so please speak now we will of course

278
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,600
take it to the list after the meeting

279
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
but we want to have a quick discussion

280
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,959
here to make sure everyone i think

281
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,399
there's pretty much agreement that we

282
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,279
should just move this thing forward

283
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,240
uh andrew supports it good

284
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
um all right so if there's nothing else

285
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,519
on this one um phil are you back to

286
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,160
having audio

287
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
looks like

288
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,040
i see the icon for audio and video

289
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,399
no no i can't hear you

290
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,480
gonna try one more thing

291
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,120
maybe change your browser

292
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,560
all right then we'll go ahead and load

293
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
up near's other presentation how's that

294
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
sound

295
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
since he's already here

296
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,040
okay

297
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
and the second draft we discussed and

298
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
the previous time was uh

299
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,360
the second edition for the controller

300
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
interface

301
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
and

302
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,320
a quick reminder

303
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
the

304
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,920
controller interface allows an absolute

305
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,720
uh

306
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,240
to manage and content and met is content

307
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
or metadata within the dance incident

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,560
operations like proposition or

309
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
invalidation

310
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
uh

311
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
we

312
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,560
suggested a new uh version for this rfc

313
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,319
uh early sanjay and myself uh next

314
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
in this new version and we already

315
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
discussed this added functionality which

316
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,360
is

317
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
additional information in the air

318
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,160
propagation

319
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,519
a

320
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,839
triggers extensibility

321
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
uh for example time policy that allows

322
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,279
us

323
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,000
uh allows the absence of the end to

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,199
indicate that he wants the a

325
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,360
preposition be done at a specific time

326
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,639
and also define two additional content

327
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,440
selection methods which are the

328
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,440
content regresses and content playlists

329
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,440
next

330
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
and

331
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,240
following the discussion which we

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
reached the point with we redefine

333
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
the trigger object so this is the

334
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,920
original version of the trigger object

335
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,959
it has

336
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,839
the trigger type for example preposition

337
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,839
it has the cdn path the list of cdns

338
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
that actually instruct

339
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,759
the operation and it allows us to

340
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
do some circuit breaking

341
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,119
and a

342
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,640
set of properties that are publicly

343
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,640
used for target selection

344
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,000
okay

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,720
the trigger should be applied on method

346
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
on des metadata urls or

347
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
those content patterns

348
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,079
etc etc

349
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,399
next

350
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,919
so the trigger v2 object first of all

351
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
edit was added with the

352
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,679
trigger extension list which is a list

353
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,320
of generic items that we can register

354
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,559
more and more item as we go

355
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,440
items

356
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,720
as we go

357
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
and in next

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,880
and

359
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
was also added with two properties for

360
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,080
project selection for content selection

361
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,679
which is the contact

362
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,960
context

363
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,559
excels and playlists

364
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,360
uh next please

365
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,000
thanks er so

366
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,799
the point we got to is okay we ask what

367
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
what could happen if we want another

368
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,600
method for content selection

369
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,720
uh

370
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
and then is it a separate property we

371
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,000
will need to define the trigger of which

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,960
we

373
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,760
and so we said okay

374
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,960
why not do the same trick use the

375
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
list of generic objects

376
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,799
for the

377
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,520
metadata and content selection as well

378
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,240
so

379
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,919
next slide

380
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,880
so what we practically want to do in

381
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
this change is to take all the green

382
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,360
properties that are used for target

383
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,240
selection to say on what on which

384
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,160
elements the trigger should be it should

385
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,200
operate

386
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,360
and put it in a list

387
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
of a generic trigger specs

388
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,240
okay

389
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
any questions so far

390
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,240
two three that's good

391
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
next okay

392
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,799
so we suggest a generic spec of the

393
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
object which is specified targets to

394
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,200
execute the trigger on

395
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,400
okay it's the generic object we may have

396
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,360
several types for example we already

397
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
defined the types matching they're all

398
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
the

399
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,600
types from arc 807 which are url spec or

400
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
uri patterns

401
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,679
as well as content playlists

402
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,000
okay and in the future we may add more

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
and more

404
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,280
types and the spec is a

405
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,960
sp

406
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
is specified for a specific trigger

407
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
subject we define a new term which is

408
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
called the trigger subject which is

409
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
either metadata or content

410
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,679
and maybe in the future where we'll have

411
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,960
something else i

412
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,120
have nothing in mind but

413
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
it can be done

414
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,880
next

415
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,120
so if we look at the spec object

416
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,799
structure it is the spec subject

417
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,120
the type of the spec

418
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,880
and their values

419
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,320
so this

420
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,080
specific example

421
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,039
it says a match metadata with the

422
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,720
following url okay we have metadata

423
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,840
that

424
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,280
that is chosen you are using url spec

425
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,159
with

426
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,200
this specific url do i have a pointer

427
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
here somehow

428
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,520
okay never mind

429
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,760
uh

430
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,679
okay

431
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,400
a

432
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
specific

433
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,120
that match the specific url

434
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
questions

435
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
we'll see an example in a minute

436
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,240
okay one last change before

437
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,120
uh

438
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,880
i'm showing the example next please

439
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
the in the original rfc uh

440
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
there was a temp trigger type which

441
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,520
which is preposition or invalidation or

442
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
purge it's actually

443
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,559
specified the operation the trigger

444
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,080
stands for

445
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,200
and

446
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
i find it more appropriate to call it

447
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
action

448
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,799
okay so i would like to have a win to

449
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,400
rename this field

450
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
and

451
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,360
to call to call it a action instead of a

452
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
type

453
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,120
okay so let's look

454
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,600
at the example yes

455
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,559
so this is the trigger v2 object

456
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
first of all it says okay the action is

457
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
preposition

458
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,080
and we would like to preposition

459
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,960
uh this following list we would like to

460
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,280
preposition metadata

461
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,559
with this single url

462
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
as well as content

463
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,520
with

464
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
that matches those two urls

465
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,760
okay and so

466
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
previously this would have been two

467
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,320
separate

468
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,360
trigger requests right you know there's

469
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,960
it was a single request there is a

470
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
metadata urls and metadata

471
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
and content url

472
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,280
so

473
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,159
uh

474
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,600
it was it was still in a single request

475
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
uh it was just

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,720
you you had to define the properties

477
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,159
over and over again so if we have uh

478
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,880
you need to define metadata url property

479
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,720
and content url property and

480
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
and change the trigger

481
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,360
version is every time you define it

482
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,400
so i see a queue here i see a question

483
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
from rajiv

484
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,880
rajiv you're going to go ahead hi guys

485
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,799
uh hope you can hear me

486
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,440
uh yes yes

487
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,039
i have a question here you're talking

488
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,480
about uh

489
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,840
metadata and content pre-positioning uh

490
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
typically when we do a content

491
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,559
pre-position we are also pre-positioning

492
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,720
the metadata with it but in this

493
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
particular case you know

494
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
you have a case where you're

495
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,120
pre-positioning metadata for a parent

496
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,760
part and content for

497
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,159
file console

498
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,760
that's the url

499
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,799
type

500
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,320
have any ability to do recursive or

501
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,679
wildcard

502
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,039
or is that only going to be on the

503
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,080
specific url

504
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,360
i'm sorry i i actually didn't

505
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,720
the line was a bit disrupted so i

506
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,039
wasn't able to hear properly

507
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,240
so so i'm i'm just wondering uh when we

508
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,960
are doing a content pre-position we are

509
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
typically doing both the content and the

510
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,360
metadata right

511
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,760
the metadata when we do a metadata

512
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,039
pre-position we are only doing the

513
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,360
metadata and not the content itself

514
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
but in this particular example you have

515
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,039
used a parent part for the metadata and

516
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,480
uh child paths for the content so i just

517
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
wanted to know how that interaction

518
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,080
works and whether when we are doing

519
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
metadata you know does the url spec

520
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,080
trigger type have the ability to do

521
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
something recursive or

522
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
is it implicit

523
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
or is it explicit in that it will only

524
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
do the specific listed urls and

525
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
you know nothing below that

526
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,919
um

527
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
actually i i would actually need to get

528
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,100
back to you with it with this uh

529
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,840
[Music]

530
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,360
for i think that

531
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,240
if

532
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
for metadata if you ask for abc

533
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,400
you'll get the metadata for abc but that

534
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,919
will also have pointers to everything

535
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,000
that's below it and it may be

536
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,679
implementation dependent on whether you

537
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,120
choose to pull all the rest

538
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,679
at that particular time

539
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,440
okay so so you're saying that it's quite

540
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
dependent on the exact metadata

541
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,480
definition of that particular object

542
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,720
right because

543
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,679
yeah so if there are pointers in the

544
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,679
metadata would

545
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,520
this uh the downstream cdn be expected

546
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
to recurse through that and

547
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,840
you know get all the

548
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
metadata for the objects that it's

549
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,760
pointing to

550
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,200
that's a good question

551
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
again

552
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,520
i don't know that we specify that i

553
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,120
don't know that we we prescribe

554
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,440
yeah so i i i suspect probably

555
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,159
specifying that either explicitly

556
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,159
make it a requirement or

557
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,679
you know if you want to keep the

558
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
behavior identical between the metadata

559
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
subject and the content subject we

560
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
clearly say that any any recursion has

561
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,520
to be explicitly requested by adding the

562
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,640
tile urls the downstream cdn wouldn't

563
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,679
implicitly recurse

564
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,120
the reason i'm bringing up this question

565
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,640
is because of this specific example

566
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,799
where we have metadata and uh content

567
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,480
preposition happening on you know

568
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,159
different levels within the hierarchy

569
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,840
yeah i would think it would be odd for

570
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,440
the downstream to

571
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,120
pull content for which it did not have

572
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
metadata

573
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,600
now whether there should be an implicit

574
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,679
pull of metadata based off the content

575
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,039
preposition is an interesting question

576
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
all right again

577
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,080
it it's probably something for

578
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,520
discussion uh on the list maybe

579
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,200
yeah i i admit i i failed to follow the

580
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
the details of this

581
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,400
this remark

582
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
um

583
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,120
but

584
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
as i understand it's not related to the

585
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,559
structure of the the trigger or it's

586
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,360
related to the specific example

587
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,279
uh yeah example and it's it's kind of

588
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,360
related to the expected behavior of the

589
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,720
downstream cdn when dealing with uh you

590
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
know a pre-position request yeah but

591
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,120
it's a a similar issue would have

592
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
could have existed with the previous

593
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,679
version of the rfc with the 807 where

594
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,399
you

595
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
already can define c8 metadata urls and

596
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,600
quantity urls together

597
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,720
it's not a new

598
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
it's

599
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,279
it's probably a use case that becomes

600
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,120
more visible because of the new

601
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
structure you're using right yes because

602
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,520
of the way it's kind of separated now it

603
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,120
may it forces us to think this way and

604
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,960
it's it's more visible now

605
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,360
it probably wasn't explicitly visible in

606
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,200
the earlier structure

607
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
yes and you should somehow relate to

608
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,679
that

609
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,600
rajiv can you also post your question in

610
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,279
the mailing list i think just so that we

611
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,360
can make sure that i will i will do that

612
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,279
we're separating the structure part of

613
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,840
it from the actual implementation piece

614
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,440
of it

615
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,640
okay

616
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
okay thanks

617
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,799
any other

618
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,679
question comment

619
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,520
okay so let's

620
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,720
proceed

621
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
i wait let's do the example sorry well

622
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,880
so i want you to okay

623
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
if you keep this example in mind okay we

624
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
will relate to it later on we have here

625
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,200
a trigger of people for preposition

626
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,159
of

627
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,760
a metadata

628
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,120
with a single url and content with two

629
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,240
different urls okay

630
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
let's move on let's move on

631
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,240
okay so similarly to the trigger v2 and

632
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,960
we needed a object we needed to redefine

633
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,600
the error object actually practically

634
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,760
defined a lv2 object without all

635
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,480
properties related to content selection

636
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,279
to

637
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,159
metadata like metadata urls et cetera

638
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,960
and we added a generic twig spec list

639
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,399
and we took

640
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,279
when we defined the status v2 object

641
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,960
which holds the arrow v2 object as well

642
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,200
so if we go to the next example

643
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,360
this is an example for an aov2 object

644
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
which in this case says that

645
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,039
the

646
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,879
air of type project

647
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,600
that we encountered an error of type

648
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
project

649
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,600
and it's important to note

650
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,279
that the error is

651
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,039
a

652
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,000
relevant is related to the lead

653
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,080
sorry

654
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,960
yeah the error the error is related is

655
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,320
relating

656
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,120
the

657
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,279
spec listed here

658
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,440
okay so it there the only the spec

659
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,000
relevant to the error are listed in the

660
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
spec list

661
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,760
okay so if you remember the example we

662
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,960
showed before

663
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,120
of the trigger we had

664
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,399
a a

665
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,200
metadata aspect and a content spec here

666
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,279
we have only the content spec

667
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,559
so the metadata we had no no error for

668
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,159
the metadata

669
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,480
and

670
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,600
if you remember the url list in the

671
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,480
twitter add two urls and here we have

672
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,440
only a single url because the error only

673
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
relates

674
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,679
to this url the other with the other url

675
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,919
everything went fine

676
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,279
okay

677
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,159
so this is the semantic of the error

678
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,000
it's similar it is similar to the

679
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,279
semantics

680
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,799
of the l the original error with

681
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,960
the previous structure

682
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
and

683
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,480
one point however i find

684
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
a bit of an issue here is

685
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
it seems like a bit of a of a a bit of a

686
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,720
hassle

687
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,880
to pass this arrow by the absence of the

688
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
end okay to understand which object

689
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,640
exactly

690
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,519
uh

691
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,480
was no

692
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,120
they relates to it's

693
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,159
it's maybe some swing comparison or

694
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,320
something like that and i would like to

695
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,880
suggest next

696
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
a

697
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,279
a bit of an adjustment to the structure

698
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,840
okay

699
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,399
so if we add some placeholders in the

700
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,000
list

701
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,760
it may allow us to uh

702
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,559
to to keep the a position

703
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,120
or to to take the trigger and the spec

704
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,039
list from the trigger

705
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,279
and uh add

706
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,200
placeholders for

707
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,519
saying okay for this object everything

708
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,919
went ahead is not relating to everything

709
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,120
went well so in this example

710
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,640
they uh

711
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,360
there is a spec list and the first video

712
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,919
is an empty spec which we respectfully

713
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
means okay they met the data spec we had

714
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,440
back then

715
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,279
everything was okay with it there is

716
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,519
nothing it does not relate to this

717
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,880
aspect

718
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
as well as if you if you are

719
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,279
going into the

720
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,640
uh

721
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
spec itself that the failing specs

722
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,360
there is a

723
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,519
again an empty object

724
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,159
in the url list meaning

725
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,760
okay this url was okay

726
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,919
the o does not apply to it

727
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,120
and

728
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
this may

729
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,720
help the

730
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,760
and better understand

731
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,960
the

732
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,159
error

733
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,279
so this is just a suggestion the uh

734
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,080
does not contain this change already and

735
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
i would be happy to your opinion about

736
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,039
it

737
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,440
so we have uh q here uh rajiv you want

738
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,480
to go first and then kevin

739
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,080
uh comments on this

740
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,000
one obviously

741
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,760
is the fact that you're

742
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,840
using your first example in the previous

743
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,679
delay uh you know there is the

744
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,399
two levels of ambiguity which makes men

745
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,760
one obviously that you've already

746
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,399
identified the fact that uh you know you

747
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
are only

748
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,799
listing those specific effects where you

749
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,039
have an error and uh

750
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,600
so in this case you're nesting at the

751
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,600
level of spec for

752
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
showing the specs that have an error but

753
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,880
what you're actually doing is you're

754
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,840
actually

755
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,080
populating it with a partial spike when

756
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,240
compared to the preposition request

757
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,559
because the request spec had two urls

758
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,440
and here you have a single url

759
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,240
so that is one question the second one

760
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,799
is you know how do you expect uh you

761
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,279
know this error to be dealt with in

762
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,399
cases where the error has happened at a

763
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,360
url that may not be part of the original

764
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,159
stick so like uh so this obviously would

765
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,159
not work with the spec type of urls but

766
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:07,360
say there's a

767
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,119
spec type of playlist which you have

768
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,560
added okay so part of that would need

769
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,480
would mean that downstream cdn passes

770
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,040
that playlist and brings all the uh

771
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,359
dependent resources of that playlist

772
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,480
into uh you know the pre-position queue

773
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,960
and populates them and say for example

774
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,520
on a playlist there's a subtitle file

775
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,480
which is giving me a 404. the rest of

776
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,639
the cop the playlist is fine i'm getting

777
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,960
a 200 on the playlist i'm getting at 200

778
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,000
on the av segments i got a 404 on the

779
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,119
subtitle segment now that subtitle url

780
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,000
is

781
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
something that i where would i put that

782
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:44,960
in

783
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,639
in this structure because that is

784
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,480
something which is not explicitly

785
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,839
mentioned in my incoming request

786
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,040
right

787
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,760
so so we'd have to be a little more uh

788
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,879
you know

789
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,400
intelligent in how we write this

790
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,280
structure in order to allow for these

791
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,760
kinds of errors to also be surfaced

792
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
and if we come to the next slide there

793
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,000
my uh

794
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,640
you know point would basically be

795
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,520
that uh you already have a status object

796
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
right is there any reason why we are

797
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,040
using an explicit error object rather

798
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,640
than just rolling the errors into a

799
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,200
generic status object and that generic

800
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,480
status object is designed to exactly

801
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,079
mirror the

802
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,720
pre-position requests

803
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:47,290
[Laughter]

804
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,599
mapping between everything

805
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,400
what succeeded what failed without us

806
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,880
having to you know put in hacks like you

807
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,760
know trying to maintain position or

808
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
without necessarily having the upstream

809
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,839
have to maintain a lot of state about

810
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,400
what it sent so that it can match up

811
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
when the response comes in

812
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,480
i've just a couple of two thoughts over

813
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,440
there

814
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,640
and

815
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
so i

816
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,880
again wasn't able to hear you well i

817
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
heard what i heard was the first

818
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
element at the

819
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
first part of the

820
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
uh what you were saying i'm sorry near

821
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,480
your voice is breaking up badly is it

822
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
just me or

823
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,960
yeah

824
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
i think maybe uh

825
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,079
rajiv if you can turn your video off and

826
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
see if that helps

827
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,599
if you can turn your video off

828
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,960
okay

829
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,160
because i was able to hear your uh

830
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,520
the first issue you presented

831
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,760
and i think it's something we need to

832
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,119
think of

833
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,920
the ability to say okay this playlist

834
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
not only this the the entire playlist

835
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
fail but only part of it

836
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,440
uh

837
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
and

838
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,680
it's

839
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,560
adds a significant complexity in the for

840
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,079
the definition of this api i believe

841
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,040
uh and need i think it we need to think

842
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,560
about it

843
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,040
um

844
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,640
and the second i i was not able to you

845
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,720
were breaking out from

846
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,040
at my place at least

847
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,880
what rajiv is saying is that

848
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,800
instead of using

849
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
why don't we create a generic object

850
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,240
instead of an error object but i think

851
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
that's

852
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,880
that really is part of these the rfc

853
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,640
already the the error

854
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,880
and it's not a generic object in that

855
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,280
sense so i'm not quite sure if

856
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,440
if i got his full question right i was

857
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
basically

858
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,560
trying to say that instead of having a

859
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,800
separate error object which only tries

860
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,079
to communicate the uh specific errors

861
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,400
why don't we roll the functionality of

862
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,720
reporting the error into a generic

863
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,079
status object so the status object is

864
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,599
designed to as closely as possible

865
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,680
mirror the structure of the incoming

866
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,960
preposition object the request so that

867
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
everything every spec that's in the

868
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,760
preposition object is available in the

869
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,720
status object and each spec in each

870
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
component of that spec has either a

871
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,359
status okay or

872
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,359
or a status error and if there's a

873
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,920
status error we have you know sub fields

874
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,040
and sub objects inside that more

875
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,160
you know

876
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,480
granularly describe what error was

877
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,680
encountered

878
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,520
the point the advantage of doing it that

879
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,520
way is that the upstream cdn doesn't

880
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,000
really need to maintain a lot of state

881
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,800
and

882
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,400
especially because some of these

883
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,480
transactions may be quite long-lived

884
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,119
transactions so if if a upstream cdn is

885
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,119
saying hey here's a set of ten

886
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,440
episodes playlist that i want you to pre

887
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,400
pre-warm or pre-position okay it it may

888
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,520
take

889
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,160
20 30 minutes for the downstream cdn to

890
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,079
complete that operation before it can

891
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,680
send the status back saying that hey

892
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
this particular trigger has now been

893
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
completed right so

894
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,599
do you really want the upstream cd and

895
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,680
trying to hold on to state

896
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,079
for that long so that it can match up

897
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,800
with an error message or if the complete

898
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,200
status message comes back it basically

899
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,720
mirrors everything that was in the

900
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,880
original pre-position request so the

901
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
upstream cdn doesn't have to have a

902
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,720
record of what it said the status

903
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,320
message is fully uh self-contained

904
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,359
yeah

905
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,200
first of all the status object itself

906
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,480
also

907
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,800
holds the trigger uh

908
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,119
the trigger v2 object

909
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,599
okay also yeah exactly

910
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,720
it's already it's the the trigger object

911
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,400
only the part of the status object it's

912
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,280
it resides in the object and the two

913
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,480
appears

914
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
both of them appears in the start in the

915
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
status object

916
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,040
uh so this is covered what is not

917
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,560
covered you you suggested also that

918
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
you would we would have an arrow at the

919
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,640
in a different object per spec so for

920
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,800
this that we have the status of this

921
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,440
block is like that and the arrow for

922
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
this package

923
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
and like

924
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,000
this is the error of this path and this

925
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,440
is the arrows of this deck and i believe

926
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,240
that

927
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,880
in we can achieve that particularly with

928
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,200
if if the opposition wants to achieve

929
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,599
that it can actually break the request

930
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,960
to several

931
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,839
twitters so it may have a trigger for

932
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,400
the fair spec and a separate trigger for

933
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,760
the second spec

934
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
and that's it so

935
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,640
yeah so so

936
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,079
my point here is

937
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,240
even with a single spec

938
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
you know that happens if it's a single

939
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,640
playlist um it may be it may be a

940
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,960
playlist say for example a movie which

941
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,359
has a quality ladder with six different

942
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,119
qualities so which means that's still

943
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,960
going to take some amount of time for

944
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,520
the downstream cdm to process before it

945
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,680
can respond so that's still

946
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
a certain amount of state that the

947
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,400
upstream cdn needs to maintain to be

948
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,520
able to correlate the errors so by

949
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,640
joining the error object as a part of

950
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,200
the status uh in the state testing as a

951
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,920
part of the trigger object itself you

952
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
know uh basically the response from the

953
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,319
downstream cdn is the trigger object

954
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,880
with it is embedded inside it so the

955
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,040
upstream does not have to

956
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,480
depend on any state the status response

957
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,920
has everything in it

958
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
yes

959
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,520
how does this advert i think we should

960
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
take it offline yeah

961
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,359
i'm going to inject myself as chair and

962
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,880
say that um

963
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,720
rajiv i think it's a good discussion if

964
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,440
you have actually uh a proposal for for

965
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,839
an object you know that might also help

966
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,280
move the thing forward but if we can

967
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,560
take this to the list and have that

968
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,319
discussion that would be great um we're

969
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,319
running a little behind schedule

970
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,720
so um near we could we could try and

971
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,359
push through the rest of this

972
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,200
thank you everyone

973
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,480
okay

974
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,079
let's uh proceed and skip

975
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,560
let's keep this one

976
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,680
next

977
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,880
yeah thanks and the last important thing

978
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,720
i want to discuss here

979
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,440
is the the photon capability objects

980
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,760
relates to this

981
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,359
control interface

982
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,640
and so the downstream sedan may support

983
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,400
some of the action it may support

984
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
pre-position and

985
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,520
invalidation but not support period

986
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,240
and

987
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,480
but it may support

988
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,240
those

989
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,880
actions but for different

990
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,079
subjects for example pre-position in in

991
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,839
validation and purge are supported for

992
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,880
metadata but only for content only

993
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,480
preposition is supported so for example

994
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,400
and we would like to be able to state

995
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,200
that

996
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,240
and

997
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,480
we would also like to say

998
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,560
for each such action

999
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,680
which

1000
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,560
extensions are supported

1001
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,720
for example a

1002
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,280
a pre-position of content support time

1003
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,160
policy but purge does not support time

1004
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,599
policy

1005
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,720
and

1006
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,079
also

1007
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
what is the target selection methods

1008
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,720
that are allowed

1009
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,160
okay so for metadata for people's

1010
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,319
version of metadata you can you may use

1011
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,119
playlist but for purge you cannot use

1012
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,400
playlist

1013
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,240
why i don't know

1014
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
okay but

1015
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,240
next

1016
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,520
okay so what we try to do is define a

1017
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,640
structure that says that for a specific

1018
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,000
action

1019
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,040
on a specific subject

1020
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,520
the list of support supported specs are

1021
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,319
this list and the list of supported

1022
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,319
supporters extensions

1023
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,319
is another list

1024
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,800
and of course everything is subject to

1025
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
the footprint that

1026
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,400
the capability is

1027
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,720
specified to so let's

1028
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,640
look at the object and an example

1029
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,200
okay so

1030
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,440
the the capability is built from a list

1031
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,040
of objects each object states the action

1032
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,480
the subject

1033
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,640
the supported specs and the supported

1034
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,079
extensions

1035
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,880
so in in this example

1036
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,599
uh we support only preposition of

1037
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,560
content and invalidation of content

1038
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,720
okay no operation of metadata is

1039
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,000
available

1040
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
no purge is available

1041
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,359
okay

1042
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,560
and the specific preposition of content

1043
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,240
can be done using your specs or ccid

1044
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,280
specs

1045
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,160
and it supports time policy

1046
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,359
however invalidation does not support

1047
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,440
a time policy it doesn't support any

1048
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,880
extension because

1049
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,000
the extensions list is empty or

1050
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,640
not appear it doesn't appear

1051
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,040
um

1052
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,599
and then that's it

1053
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,680
and do you have any questions for this

1054
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,359
i think there's been good discussion

1055
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:24,240
here i think everyone please go and read

1056
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,720
the draft and we'll have

1057
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,920
we'll continue the discussion on the

1058
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,520
list i think this is good there have

1059
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,640
been a lot of um good updates to

1060
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,400
triggers and i think we're

1061
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,079
making a lot of progress on making it

1062
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:38,319
better so i'm excited

1063
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,119
by the discussion

1064
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,440
if there's no other questions

1065
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,560
thank you

1066
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,079
and we'll give phil another shot at this

1067
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,400
and

1068
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,240
did you have anything else

1069
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,839
thanks

1070
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,800
kevin you want me to see if i can bring

1071
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,480
the slides up in the meantime while we

1072
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,280
get um

1073
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,560
phil still get back on

1074
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,079
uh phil still there

1075
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:33,640
new browser and

1076
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,078
i don't see the mic icon

1077
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,359
what i see is that your mic is muted

1078
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,560
oh

1079
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,079
maybe we we come back at the end of the

1080
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,480
of the representations so you want to go

1081
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,119
ahead and do frederick's

1082
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,240
um

1083
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,558
yeah

1084
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,119
so you probably have to drive that

1085
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,359
yep

1086
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,440
i'll just stand up here

1087
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,800
https

1088
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,440
delegation

1089
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
where is

1090
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:53,280
it we go

1091
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,319
okay so i'm just voicing um

1092
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,960
fred here he's he could not make the um

1093
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,319
the meeting today as he was not feeling

1094
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:01,200
well

1095
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,559
um so

1096
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,680
the the revision of the draft that uh

1097
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,839
that is put out uh in the mailing list

1098
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,760
and also in a in the

1099
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,599
really the the main change in this

1100
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,920
version eight really is that it has been

1101
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,680
pretty much cleaned up and has been very

1102
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,559
simple very much simplified so what we

1103
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,359
really see is that this document is now

1104
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,160
aligned with rfc 9115

1105
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,319
and

1106
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:30,400
so basically what 9115 prescribes is

1107
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,839
a pre

1108
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,119
cdn

1109
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,359
conversation that can happen between a

1110
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,920
downstream cdn and upstream cdn where

1111
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,160
the downstream will create an account

1112
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,359
into

1113
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,119
this entity

1114
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,359
and it will exchange the certificate

1115
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:47,599
information etc and all of that so once

1116
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,319
all of that is done really the

1117
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,880
the only um only part that is required

1118
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,000
in this rfc is to be able to identify

1119
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,839
that um

1120
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,000
what is the location from where

1121
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,119
um the downstream cdn will go and fetch

1122
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,599
the certificate information and all of

1123
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,680
the conversation has already happened

1124
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,280
before it so

1125
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,240
so there's no uh exchange of information

1126
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,359
other than

1127
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,280
um that

1128
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,079
the the https um draft this draft will

1129
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,599
basically essentially

1130
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,480
uh only go out and make the request to

1131
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,280
pull

1132
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,760
the certificate from the upstream cdn

1133
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,720
and that's what the the change is really

1134
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,040
for this particular

1135
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,440
draft

1136
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,000
so as you see here the example acme

1137
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,079
delegations and and then the

1138
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,040
the url that has been already identified

1139
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,599
on which it will go and retrieve

1140
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,760
the request from so that really is the

1141
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,880
change

1142
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,800
um

1143
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,920
you want to go to the next slide

1144
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,880
and then

1145
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,200
we still have to talk through about

1146
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,359
uh security and privacy

1147
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,079
the the sense is that since this draft

1148
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,240
is not adding any other exposing any

1149
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,599
other metadata

1150
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,319
so there's really not any additional

1151
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,319
security questions that come into play

1152
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,359
here

1153
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,400
and

1154
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,440
the rfc 9115

1155
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,160
and rfc 8006 already have addressed

1156
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,119
independently of this draft

1157
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,319
their security concerns that uh ensure

1158
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,880
that the metadata is preserved or within

1159
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,079
the rfc 9115

1160
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,480
that there's no other security leak so i

1161
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,640
think this document may by itself may

1162
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,400
not have anything that

1163
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,839
exposes

1164
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,720
the security and privacy concerns but i

1165
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,160
think we still want to just talk through

1166
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,760
that

1167
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,359
preferably in the mailing list if you

1168
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,040
can review the draft and see if there

1169
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,880
are any questions or concerns

1170
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,880
that this draft should address with

1171
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,359
respect to security and with respect to

1172
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,839
privacy

1173
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,000
so i think what

1174
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,240
from the author's standpoint

1175
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,880
the request is that if folks can review

1176
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,400
this draft

1177
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,839
this version 8

1178
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,279
and respond in the mailing list

1179
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,559
for any questions you have or you may

1180
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,319
have

1181
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:19,119
and

1182
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,520
based on that based on the progress then

1183
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
maybe we can ask for the working group

1184
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,119
last call for version eight

1185
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,079
i think that um you know it's it's much

1186
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,319
simplified now which is good

1187
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,440
um

1188
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,920
uh i will go ahead and do the shepard

1189
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,200
pre-review on on the new version

1190
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,280
and hopefully everyone else can also go

1191
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,200
out and review it

1192
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,240
it's

1193
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,520
it should be

1194
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,240
pretty straightforward now um to move

1195
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,640
forward with it i think we took out a

1196
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,240
lot of the the

1197
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,800
other stuff about metadata and

1198
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,040
the harder stuff so right

1199
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,119
yeah

1200
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,000
okay all right uh any anyone have any

1201
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
thoughts or questions otherwise please

1202
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,559
review the draft i will review the draft

1203
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,880
uh officially and

1204
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,480
we'll try and move this forward by next

1205
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,960
ietf

1206
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,359
all right sounds good thank you

1207
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,880
um

1208
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,079
is kristoff around

1209
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,119
can you hear me

1210
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,119
yes

1211
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,359
okay so i'm christopher wordpeak um

1212
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:39,440
yes i'm going to present an update on

1213
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,680
this draft here

1214
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,200
uh on

1215
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,319
delegated credentials subsets

1216
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,760
so the start of this draft is actually

1217
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,240
the result result of a split of the

1218
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
previous draft that just has been

1219
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,119
presented so the previous draft is about

1220
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,240
delegated certificates and this one here

1221
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,359
is about delegated credential which is

1222
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,200
ongoing work in the tls working group

1223
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,640
and

1224
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,640
so this split has already been discussed

1225
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,319
in the in this group here in cdni and um

1226
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,960
yeah and uh yeah i would like to ask for

1227
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,160
adoption of this uh draft within the cdi

1228
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,960
cdna working group

1229
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,920
uh the next line

1230
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,240
so currently what is in the draft it's

1231
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,079
uh that two

1232
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,880
objects which are defined two mi objects

1233
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,119
one is a

1234
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,520
conf delegated credential

1235
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,800
it only contains a url and

1236
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,440
the idea is that the downstream cdn when

1237
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,880
fetch or when accessing this url

1238
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,280
can download another object and this

1239
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,520
other object is this delegated

1240
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,599
credential objects which contains the

1241
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,040
delegated credential as defined in the

1242
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,160
subset

1243
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,559
internet draft and also

1244
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,559
key material

1245
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,680
so that's

1246
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,520
yeah so it's quite simple those two

1247
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,800
objects uh one which allows to

1248
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,640
just provide an url in the other which

1249
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,319
transports all the

1250
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,240
uh cryptographic material let's say

1251
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,280
so next line

1252
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,280
so there are a couple of things to do in

1253
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,680
the for this draft uh

1254
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,280
so the first one is

1255
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,119
so is about aligning those two drafts so

1256
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,760
the one on dedicated certificates and

1257
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,000
one on dedicated credential

1258
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,839
just about the advertisement so that we

1259
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:46,000
have an fci object which is a bit common

1260
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,400
in which would allow to announce the

1261
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,720
what is supported by the downstream cdni

1262
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,280
and it could also allow to

1263
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,400
advertise

1264
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,119
additional parameters

1265
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,119
there are sections about privacy and

1266
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:01,280
security that needs to be added

1267
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,839
and then but the main thing is about the

1268
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:04,640
there's

1269
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,400
still an issue about this delegated

1270
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,319
credential object which is not really an

1271
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:11,920
mi object as as uh

1272
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,119
[Music]

1273
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,359
as in the spirit of cdni so i have a

1274
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:17,760
slide on this in the next slide

1275
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,200
and

1276
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,599
and then there are also things like um

1277
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,240
currently in the current proposal the

1278
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,880
public private key is generated by the

1279
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,799
upstream cdn and maybe this is not

1280
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,040
something that we always want to do

1281
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,839
we should also support uh the case where

1282
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,319
the downstream cdn is generating this

1283
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:38,880
key and then asks for the delegated

1284
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,319
credential for

1285
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:43,280
to the upstream cdn

1286
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,240
okay next slide

1287
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,119
so yeah the open issue is that uh well

1288
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,079
this delegated credential objects is not

1289
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,520
really an mi object in the spirit of

1290
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,759
the rfc 8006

1291
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,079
because it's uh it's not um

1292
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:06,400
well it's not fetched as a normal mi

1293
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,720
object this is fetched via this url

1294
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,720
which is defined in the configuration

1295
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,799
delegated credential objects

1296
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,000
but if we uh remove delegated credential

1297
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,640
from this draft well there's no

1298
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,040
point of uh

1299
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,440
of just keeping the dedicated credential

1300
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,520
of the conf delegated credential objects

1301
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,400
and

1302
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,799
so they're different object uh

1303
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,400
options on

1304
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,559
how to solve this issue

1305
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,200
i mean the issue is really about uh how

1306
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,440
can we fetch the delegated credential

1307
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,200
how the downstream cdn can fetch the

1308
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,799
delegated credentials

1309
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,599
so there are one could be to rely on an

1310
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,599
fci object which allows for the

1311
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,119
downstream cdn to announce the number of

1312
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,760
uh delegated credential it needs and

1313
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,480
then the upstream cdn pushes the

1314
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,760
delegated credential vsmi object

1315
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,839
but the problem here is that

1316
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,319
it's not really dynamic that we have to

1317
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,400
keep in mind that dedicated credentials

1318
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,160
have a very short

1319
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,799
validity times so we have to renew

1320
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:12,880
them regularly and

1321
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,480
it's kind of the downstream cd and each

1322
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,920
time it sees that

1323
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,839
a delegated credential is expiring it

1324
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,440
has to fetch a new one so we need a

1325
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,559
really dynamic mechanism

1326
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,400
and the other option would be to well

1327
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,720
specify a dedicated interface which

1328
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,720
allowed to fetch delegated credentials

1329
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,240
so that

1330
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
either it's an interface somewhere in

1331
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,760
cdni or sva that needs to be defined

1332
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,839
maybe the trigger interface i don't know

1333
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,440
or something something else some

1334
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,079
dedicated to that or

1335
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,520
by proposing an extension so option b

1336
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,720
in the acme working group um

1337
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,680
which

1338
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,680
details how to fetch the delegated

1339
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,680
credentials

1340
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,440
so this is something which is mentioned

1341
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,079
in the subserts

1342
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,440
draft

1343
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,160
but

1344
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,079
i don't know if the acme walking group

1345
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,119
would exact accept that knowing that

1346
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,400
the idea the interest of this delegated

1347
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,040
credential is that you don't need any ca

1348
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,040
anymore so it's not really in the scope

1349
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
of the acme protocol

1350
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,640
so

1351
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,280
and yeah i mean i wanted to really

1352
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,040
present all the

1353
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,359
options and the this open issue and have

1354
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,440
feedback maybe on the mailing list maybe

1355
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,359
today on the discussion

1356
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:32,720
and to see how to move forward

1357
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,920
thank you kristoff i i know i owe you a

1358
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,920
response on the mailing list as well i

1359
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,760
haven't responded that email yet um i

1360
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,799
apologize for that but uh sanjay is in

1361
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:45,920
the queue sanjay

1362
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,040
yeah um one quick question christoph um

1363
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,559
i think the

1364
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,799
i'm not sure that this draft will really

1365
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,119
go into the acme working group

1366
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,960
um because it really refers to the

1367
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,000
subserts which is the work done in the

1368
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,400
tls working group so i think it would be

1369
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,359
better to to sort of if you're making

1370
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:08,079
use of the uh subserts then keep the

1371
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,480
focus clear that it really

1372
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,520
um any reliance it has is focused solely

1373
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,119
on that um

1374
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,559
that rfc

1375
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,520
um

1376
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,680
the second point is that i i noticed

1377
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,960
that the

1378
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,000
the final version of uh that draft in

1379
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,720
tls group has been submitted for rfc

1380
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,160
though there's a slight change and i

1381
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,640
don't know if materially that matters

1382
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,720
but they're talking about that subsearch

1383
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,960
document will apply to

1384
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,240
dtls

1385
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,000
instead of the tls

1386
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,480
um it may materially not matter but i

1387
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,079
just wanted to call that out also enough

1388
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,520
not sure if you paid that attention to

1389
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,160
that part

1390
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,720
no i haven't i will have a look to to

1391
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,160
understand the

1392
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,118
the difference

1393
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,040
okay uh i'm gonna put myself in the list

1394
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,839
or in the queue i think um you know i i

1395
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,640
brought up the this it's not really

1396
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,079
um a metadata thing um i still need to

1397
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:14,720
think about it more i don't know

1398
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,559
that it makes sense to create an

1399
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,640
interface just for this maybe we can

1400
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,040
make an exception but it is something

1401
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,040
separate i am concerned about the

1402
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,599
security parameters of we're now going

1403
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:26,480
to be

1404
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,400
retrieving key material and we need to

1405
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,480
be much more conscious of how we're

1406
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,640
doing that and that

1407
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,920
feels like a

1408
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,880
security area not in you know not an art

1409
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,799
problem but and we may get a lot of

1410
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,880
pushback on that

1411
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,559
if we try and specify something like

1412
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,200
that in here um we can specify the

1413
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,839
format excuse me right all you're really

1414
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,520
doing is specifying the format and not

1415
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,680
who's going to set up this server to to

1416
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,720
provide it but it's a it's a

1417
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,799
it's a fine line right now we're gonna

1418
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,720
have to say what what version of tls are

1419
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,400
you gonna use to pull this and is that

1420
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,920
good enough and

1421
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,799
um

1422
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,720
i don't know that we want to go down

1423
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,119
that road but i think everyone should

1424
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,720
take a look at the draft and if you have

1425
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,480
thoughts or comments on where we should

1426
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,319
take it please please respond to the

1427
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,119
list send your comments there and we can

1428
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,319
try and take this forward

1429
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,040
now as chair we wanted to have a

1430
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,040
discussion quickly on whether or not we

1431
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,520
can go ahead and adopt this draft this

1432
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,960
was a split out from an existing working

1433
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,000
group draft um

1434
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,680
i i don't see a problem with us taking

1435
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,960
on this work since we already had the

1436
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,280
work and and we probably should move

1437
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,440
this work forward but as a matter of

1438
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,119
protocol we wanted to

1439
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,520
um you know bring it up and say hey

1440
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,880
does is the working group still

1441
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,720
interested in going down this road i

1442
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,079
assume we are but if anyone has any um

1443
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,839
objections please feel free to voice

1444
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:54,000
them now we will of course go to the

1445
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,559
list and send out an actual adoption

1446
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:57,440
email

1447
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,440
and uh solicit

1448
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,839
feedback but

1449
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,160
if there are no objections here we will

1450
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,839
go ahead and start that process

1451
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:14,319
all right i think we're

1452
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:15,839
i think we're good kristoff anything

1453
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,160
else you wanted to add

1454
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,880
well that's all on my side thank you so

1455
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,920
much

1456
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,280
thank you um

1457
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,640
we're gonna give phil another shot

1458
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,839
nope no idea

1459
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:42,160
okay

1460
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:42,560
so

1461
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,240
[Music]

1462
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,240
do we want to hear the access token or

1463
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,039
we want to wait until after if

1464
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,200
um

1465
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,079
well okay let's let yeah let's let chris

1466
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,400
go let's go ahead and let chris go

1467
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,039
and give phil some another shot it

1468
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,920
all right my audio working

1469
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,920
yes well yes

1470
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,400
fantastic and video too all right and

1471
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,359
you got my slides up excellent yes

1472
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,480
i'm going to try to move a little bit

1473
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,000
quickly through this that we have time

1474
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,400
for at least a couple of questions uh

1475
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,280
this is gonna be the common access token

1476
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,079
uh next slide

1477
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:25,359
yep

1478
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,480
and uh we're gonna start out i wanna

1479
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:31,200
talk about who's doing this uh

1480
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,880
what all we're doing and how that

1481
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,400
relates to

1482
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,000
the uri signing that is uh

1483
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,319
uh being worked on in this group

1484
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,400
and uh why this group might care next

1485
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,400
slide

1486
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,760
so this work is coming out of the cta

1487
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,079
wave project

1488
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,319
and the primary use case is for

1489
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,240
streaming media

1490
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:57,119
although

1491
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:59,039
the token itself is a little bit more

1492
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,000
general

1493
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,240
and the goal is to find a single token

1494
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,440
that covers all of the existing usages

1495
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,960
in the industry

1496
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:09,200
from all of the

1497
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,240
uh

1498
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,720
uh all of the cdn specific tokens that

1499
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,319
are in use today next slide

1500
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,039
so uh talk a little bit about how this

1501
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,000
is different from the uri signing that

1502
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,640
this group is doing uh

1503
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,520
this uh the common access token is cwt

1504
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,720
based

1505
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,760
um

1506
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:35,520
so it's it's going to be um

1507
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,480
smaller terser and is a little bit

1508
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,640
faster to parse

1509
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,559
for cdns

1510
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,960
there are more musts for the

1511
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,839
intermediaries that receive these tokens

1512
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:48,960
and so

1513
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,839
the idea is to kind of draw a

1514
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,039
very very firm fence around

1515
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,960
what needs to be supported in order to

1516
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,240
claim

1517
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,480
common access token support

1518
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,440
and

1519
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,760
provide

1520
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,240
provide strong guarantees so that

1521
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,039
issuers can issue tokens knowing that

1522
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,799
any intermediary can process it

1523
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,160
obviously there's going to be no

1524
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,319
built-in support for delegation it's not

1525
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,160
part of a larger

1526
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,440
cdni or other interconnect effort it is

1527
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,119
just a token

1528
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:24,720
uh but it does generally have more

1529
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,359
claims with greater complex complexity

1530
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,839
next slide

1531
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,079
all right

1532
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,160
we have uh

1533
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,960
uh just like the just like the uri

1534
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,160
setting token uh it has encrypted claims

1535
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,039
in order to protect the privacy

1536
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,680
of the uh end user

1537
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:48,000
um but unlike it instead of putting it

1538
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,640
as a base64 string it uses the cozy

1539
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,960
object directly this saves processing

1540
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,799
time and is

1541
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,240
uh

1542
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,400
and saves a lot of space

1543
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,720
avoids repeated base64y

1544
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,319
unfortunately this means you can't use

1545
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:03,680
the subclaim

1546
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,440
because that's a string

1547
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,680
and this needs to be a cozy object we'll

1548
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,359
get onto more of that

1549
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,480
in a minute next slide

1550
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,760
so it also has some additional claims

1551
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,880
the first few are

1552
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,599
really trying to draw a box around

1553
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,079
any request

1554
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,359
information

1555
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:28,319
that

1556
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:30,720
intermediaries or

1557
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,960
providers are likely to use

1558
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,079
in order to determine what content is uh

1559
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,200
returned

1560
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,319
so

1561
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,240
the http method

1562
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,680
is uh has a claim on it so that you can

1563
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,680
specify that if your token is valid for

1564
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,839
get but not put

1565
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,400
and not post for example

1566
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,000
and the

1567
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,880
uh

1568
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,760
alpn is actually an extension of

1569
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,079
the fact that you can adjust based on

1570
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,280
scheme

1571
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,720
and so

1572
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,720
there are tokens that claim https but

1573
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,480
not http

1574
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,440
using the regular expression on the uri

1575
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,680
we wanted to extend that to

1576
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,000
the alpn more generally

1577
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,319
and then there are a number of headers

1578
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,480
including an arbitrary number of

1579
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,240
unspecified headers

1580
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,160
that uh servers can use to return

1581
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:22,960
uh

1582
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,520
different differing information uh they

1583
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,440
are of course well advised to use the

1584
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,160
very header appropriately here

1585
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,799
but um yes

1586
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,200
having a regular expression on arbitrary

1587
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,119
headers

1588
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,160
um

1589
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,839
we have some geography claims

1590
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:43,359
um that we're still working out the

1591
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:44,640
details on

1592
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,200
uh we have a claim for the tls public

1593
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,400
key

1594
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,720
this allows you to use uh

1595
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,799
for the tokens something similar to what

1596
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:57,359
oauth does with mtls self-signed certs

1597
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,160
uh wherein you use if you use a

1598
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,599
certificate even a self-signed

1599
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,079
certificate to acquire an authorization

1600
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,920
token by whatever means you provide

1601
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:08,640
credentials to get authorization tokens

1602
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,520
um

1603
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,000
the issuer can bind your public key to

1604
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,680
the token it gives you

1605
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,080
and the intermediary can

1606
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,439
guarantee

1607
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,080
that the

1608
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,319
certificate you presented matches the

1609
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,359
token so that if your token is stolen

1610
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,960
then it can't be used without your

1611
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,198
private key as well

1612
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:31,759
we have nestable compositions for and or

1613
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:33,040
and nor

1614
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,120
and that drastically increases the

1615
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,479
flexibility of the token and increases

1616
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:41,600
the language that issuers can use

1617
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,679
and lastly we have actions that modify

1618
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,120
the rejections

1619
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,000
so there are situations where when a

1620
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,600
token is rejected

1621
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,799
uh you

1622
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,439
the issuer wants a very specific status

1623
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:57,198
code uh and some headers to be returned

1624
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:58,960
and uh

1625
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,560
we're still workshopping exactly what

1626
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,640
this is going to look like but the idea

1627
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,000
is that

1628
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,040
this will allow issuers to uh define

1629
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,000
these rejections directly

1630
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,479
next slide

1631
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,479
okay

1632
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,679
another difference is that uh we have

1633
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,238
some strong types on these claims so for

1634
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,839
example the critical claim here is an

1635
01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:25,120
array of claim numbers uh

1636
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,600
claim numbers and uh strings

1637
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,238
uh encrypted claims are of a cozy

1638
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:32,479
encrypt type directly

1639
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:34,560
network claims are going to be uh it's

1640
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,198
going to be a seabor array of rfc 9164

1641
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,000
tags uh other types uh other claims are

1642
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,920
going to have appropriate types this

1643
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,799
will reduce the amount of parsing

1644
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:46,960
of strings and error handling that has

1645
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,960
to happen uh post uh

1646
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,640
well-formed validation next slide

1647
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,679
so let's talk about why we in this group

1648
01:09:57,679 --> 01:09:59,199
might care about it

1649
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,199
or we might not

1650
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,920
um so like the alpn method and headers

1651
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,960
those are just general um

1652
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,560
uh uri

1653
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,320
uh signing claims

1654
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,360
they're applicable to any sort of a

1655
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,679
uh any sort of a token like this um

1656
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,920
compositions encrypted subject critical

1657
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,040
claim those aren't even specific to

1658
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:23,840
um

1659
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,440
uri signing they are literally just

1660
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,360
generic uh

1661
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,040
claims

1662
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:35,040
um

1663
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,520
these are potentially generally useful

1664
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:39,600
maybe it's useful to try to define them

1665
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,120
generally

1666
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,800
in a broader sense

1667
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,840
next slide

1668
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,280
uh

1669
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:51,760
there's overlapping utility all uri

1670
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,600
signing tokens can be represented as

1671
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,280
cats here

1672
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,040
and any successor token is likely to use

1673
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,120
uh at least some of these

1674
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,960
i don't see a whole lot of energy for

1675
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,120
any sort of successor token

1676
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,920
um to the

1677
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,679
wonderful and delightful token that this

1678
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:12,719
group has that satisfies the needs

1679
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:15,440
but if there ever were

1680
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,840
it's likely that such a token

1681
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,159
would overlap heavily with at least some

1682
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:23,519
of these claims next slide

1683
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,040
so there's no real takeaway here uh this

1684
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,800
is no action items this is uh noodles

1685
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,560
for your noodle machine

1686
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,640
and some public domain cats

1687
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,320
um and i wanted to leave at least a few

1688
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,840
minutes of time for

1689
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,440
questions um about

1690
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,040
uh what this token is and what it's

1691
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,360
doing

1692
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,400
kevin so

1693
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,760
um i guess how far along are is the

1694
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,719
development of this and do you see

1695
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,040
um adoption of it and

1696
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,520
do you think that it will

1697
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,920
it will go anywhere or whether or not

1698
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,960
you know uri signing token just

1699
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
it will it also go somewhere or will it

1700
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,560
fall by the wayside because this thing

1701
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,880
is more i guess does this add a whole

1702
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,239
bunch of stuff that people want or does

1703
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,400
it just add a whole bunch of stuff

1704
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,800
it definitely adds it it definitely adds

1705
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,880
a bunch of stuff that people want

1706
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,159
and it adds

1707
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,080
some stuff

1708
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,880
and which category which thing

1709
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,400
uh is in

1710
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,000
uh depends

1711
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,800
based on the use cases

1712
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,880
um so like there are some there are some

1713
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,960
folks with zero interest in any of the

1714
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,480
tls stuff

1715
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,600
um

1716
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,080
and there are folks that are like no no

1717
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,159
that that enables my very specific use

1718
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,840
case

1719
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,040
and so

1720
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,760
um there is there's a lot of drive

1721
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,840
towards adoption on this

1722
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:51,520
and that's why this work is happening in

1723
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:52,880
the cta

1724
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:53,760
um

1725
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,159
that there's a group of people there

1726
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,760
that represent a variety of

1727
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,600
intermediaries and

1728
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,800
providers

1729
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:01,679
that

1730
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,280
uh

1731
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,199
yeah um

1732
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,520
uh uh

1733
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,679
that have a lot of energy towards this

1734
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,679
and they're really pushing for something

1735
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,840
that will be genuinely implemented

1736
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,280
across

1737
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,840
a wide variety of

1738
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,280
intermediaries and so yeah the the goal

1739
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,800
is to codify

1740
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,800
the feature set that people are already

1741
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:24,800
doing so that they don't so that nobody

1742
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,800
has to give up features by switching

1743
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,600
tokens right

1744
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,320
and do you think that this is something

1745
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,520
um

1746
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,560
we should liaise with or is it just

1747
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,360
be aware if we choose to take forward

1748
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,040
uri signing if we don't ever do anything

1749
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:43,120
else with urs signing then

1750
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,600
they can go and do what they want

1751
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,320
yeah i i think that some sort of a

1752
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,400
liaison probably makes sense there's a

1753
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,159
lot of overlap in uh participation

1754
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,320
already

1755
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,679
which is which is a valuable thing

1756
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,040
i think there is um

1757
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,280
if this uh if the cat takes off and uri

1758
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,040
signing token does not for whatever

1759
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,920
reason it may at some point be valuable

1760
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,199
to define an interface layer between

1761
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,239
the uri signing token and the cat

1762
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,600
that allows people to use the cat for

1763
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,520
uh cdna delegation right

1764
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,280
we may want a metadata at least or

1765
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,239
something to support it right

1766
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,440
right um and now if we if if we ever

1767
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,880
want to take on that work there are

1768
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,000
other questions we have to ask um and

1769
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,400
a lot of the the musts

1770
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,520
around this were intentionally left out

1771
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,440
of the uri signing draft because there

1772
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,679
was not a desire to force all of the

1773
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,560
intermediaries to implement all of these

1774
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,120
features in order to

1775
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,960
do cdni

1776
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,159
um right

1777
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,960
and and the goal here is to create uh

1778
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,280
you know genuine interoperability and

1779
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,600
may is the may is the bane of an

1780
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:10,719
interoperable system right

1781
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,239
so

1782
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,360
uh

1783
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,600
if we ever do that

1784
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,679
there is a there is definitely going to

1785
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,480
be some um some questions an issuer can

1786
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,840
express anything that they need to

1787
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,840
express in a cat but there are more

1788
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,239
requirements on an intermediary uh

1789
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,239
supporting a cat than there would be on

1790
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,360
supporting a uri signing token

1791
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:35,440
got it sanjay

1792
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,600
yeah um so chris i

1793
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,560
before

1794
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:40,080
you were put on the agenda i did see

1795
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,280
that there was some support in the

1796
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,800
mailing list about you know you talking

1797
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,520
about it so i'm glad you did that

1798
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,880
um and you clarified some of the

1799
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,880
questions that kevin was asking

1800
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,080
um

1801
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,920
moving forward you also mentioned about

1802
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,520
implementation so that's an important

1803
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,320
thing

1804
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,199
um

1805
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,800
so i'm i'm wondering

1806
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:59,280
um if you want to keep us

1807
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,120
sort of apprised

1808
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,080
maybe you know in july when we meet

1809
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,080
to see you know where you are you know

1810
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,440
other companies are if there's any

1811
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,120
implementation and

1812
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,280
and you know maybe

1813
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,520
if there's anything that you made use of

1814
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,280
out of the uri signing

1815
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,199
so you know we'd like to hear more about

1816
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:19,520
it and see you know where you are at

1817
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,199
yeah um

1818
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,800
i can certainly i can certainly keep the

1819
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,360
group updated um and yeah there's

1820
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,520
there's no surprises um

1821
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,400
the

1822
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,719
the the structure is very similar

1823
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:31,679
they're

1824
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:34,239
coots versus jutes it's you know it's

1825
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,719
the same roots at the core

1826
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,400
there are only a few obvious ways to

1827
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,679
express these sorts of things

1828
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,360
okay

1829
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,199
thanks for the chance i just wanted to

1830
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,520
say that uh to the earlier question

1831
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,199
there is definitely very very heavy

1832
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,920
interest from content providers and the

1833
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,640
cdn in the ecosystem of content delivery

1834
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,719
to support a common scheme right now the

1835
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,199
ecosystem is extremely fragmented and

1836
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,159
cad has the benefits of flexibility with

1837
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:07,120
these

1838
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,520
logical claims that can be

1839
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,760
put together with ants and ours but also

1840
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,840
the conciseness of that which helps the

1841
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:15,440
performance which is extremely critical

1842
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,400
for

1843
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:19,360
the cdn vendors

1844
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,440
thank you

1845
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,320
anyone else have any comments on this

1846
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,480
phil

1847
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,040
are you back

1848
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,320
thank you thank you thanks chris

1849
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,400
say get phil

1850
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,920
can you hear me

1851
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,520
yes oh yes yes i can hear you

1852
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,960
finally

1853
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,360
it took you what hour and for 45 hour

1854
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,280
and 15 minutes

1855
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,880
meet echo thinks it has something to do

1856
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,800
with the udp session initiation but oh

1857
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,640
this is amazing i can i can see all

1858
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,840
kinds of little

1859
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,640
uh

1860
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:06,320
wave things going on over there all

1861
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,360
right sorry

1862
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,880
um

1863
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:09,600
so

1864
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,000
my my thoughts on this um i love

1865
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,679
standards

1866
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:15,920
things that are generic that can be used

1867
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,679

1868
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:20,239
i think that's why we change uri signing

1869
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:23,040
to be jwt instead of all the query

1870
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,239
params stuff that it was in the

1871
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,880
beginning um if something like this

1872
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,880
comes along that that fills that gap

1873
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,880
better than uri signing i'm all for it i

1874
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,960
don't i think you are a signing with

1875
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,320
something that came along because there

1876
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,480
was nothing else that did it but if

1877
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,280
there's a more generic solution for it

1878
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,840
i like it and i think the um the puns

1879
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:42,880
are going to work out the memes are

1880
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,239
going to work out a lot better for cat

1881
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:47,280
than they will for uri signing

1882
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:49,679
excellent

1884
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:56,159
oh funny andrew i got it

1885
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,360
all right phil do you want to talk about

1886
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,840
your signing real quickly

1887
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,560
sure um so

1888
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,040
uh the the issues that ben had with it

1889
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:08,640
there was one

1890
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,560
minor clarification he wanted to see

1891
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,719
which i added and he was happy with the

1892
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:14,880
other thing the other point was having

1893
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,920
to do with delegated shared keys going

1894
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,199
from

1895
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,719
from going from csp to ucdn he was fine

1896
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:25,280
with it was from ucdn to dcdn that he

1897
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,120
did not like

1898
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,560
and i

1899
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,920
wrote to the mailing list and nobody

1900
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,679
really replied and we decided to just go

1901
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:32,560
ahead

1902
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,719
and and correct it

1903
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,600
so what i did was remove the the

1904
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,800
explanation of how to do it and like

1905
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,000
there were a couple places where it was

1906
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,440
like oh and you can do this here and i

1907
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,040
just removed that part

1908
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,800
but i did not remove the concept

1909
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,199
entirely

1910
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,800
because i did not want somebody to

1911
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,800
rediscover this and say oh this is a

1912
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,400
great and clever idea i've come up with

1913
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,640
and let me implement this and instead i

1914
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,400
put um that they should not do this um

1915
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,400
ben is still concerned that that's in

1916
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,800
there at all um

1917
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,400
and that it's should not versus must not

1918
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,360
i guess i i'm i was torn on this i

1919
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,800
thought about this for a while before i

1920
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,239
went with should not

1921
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,040
um and mostly because i felt like we had

1922
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,360
we had no recourse like if we say you

1923
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,960
must not do this

1924
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,679
um or else what like they can do it in

1925
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:26,320
the background it's it's already out of

1926
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,840
band there's nothing that it's breaking

1927
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,520
there's no way to detect it or stop it

1928
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,760
so i just said you should not do it

1929
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,080
i think he wants it to be must not i'm

1930
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,280
super open

1931
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,080
to

1932
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,560
to that being a better route i just

1933
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,120
didn't know if i had a solid argument to

1934
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,639
make so it

1935
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:43,600
please

1936
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,000
give me the the grounds to stand on and

1937
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,639
i will gladly make that change

1938
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:51,120
i see francesco on the mic here so

1939
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,480
francesca

1940
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,760
hi phil

1941
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,560
um

1942
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,080
about the should not uh something that

1943
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,719
should be noted is that it's not enough

1944
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,800
to say should not and

1945
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,159
um

1946
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:07,280
and let the reader decide that what what

1947
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,600
level this is like how

1948
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,560
um

1949
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,960
you know required or recommended it is

1950
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,800
to not do this or

1951
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,239
it there needs to be text around um and

1952
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,800
i haven't reviewed the text so like

1953
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,280
yeah i'm not sure at the moment if there

1954
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,440
is enough text about that but

1955
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,440
it needs to be clear what the

1956
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,840
consequences are of implementing this

1957
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,480
and

1958
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,080
in in um

1959
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:36,320
like ideally should not means that um

1960
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,280
there are

1961
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,560
like the the writer foresee cases where

1962
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,800
this is allowed

1963
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,600
and this could be like corner cases or

1964
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,159
you know situations in which you cannot

1965
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:50,320
do differently than

1966
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,760
actually using this mechanism and

1967
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,679
that's what the should and should not is

1968
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,199
for it's for allowing these corner cases

1969
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,600
and describing the content context and

1970
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,760
like maybe examples in which

1971
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,960
this is acceptable um

1972
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,920
and yeah this is uh we see this a lot in

1973
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,239
in isu evaluation where

1974
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,520
we considered

1975
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,080
is it must or should really and i think

1976
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,120
it

1977
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,800
applies here as well um

1978
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,400
so maybe that's

1979
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,440
that could clarify a bit uh ben's point

1980
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,960
about

1981
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:29,760
why um this should maybe is not enough

1982
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,719
to him

1983
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:32,320
um

1984
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,159
i don't know if it helps at all but like

1985
01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:36,960
i see the point of you know not wanting

1986
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,440
it to remove it completely and then

1987
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,960
someone reinventing it um

1988
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,440
it really depends on on the actual text

1989
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,520
that is around this should not in my

1990
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,040
opinion

1991
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,520
how strong it is and how

1992
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,560
well-described it is

1993
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,360
okay yeah i i don't i don't see any

1994
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,000
like valid use cases other than

1995
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,360
people

1996
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,360
who implement are saying no i really

1997
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,800
want to use shared key and i really want

1998
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,199
to use this and and i think we've said a

1999
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:09,360
ton of stuff about not doing it and why

2000
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:10,800
not to do it there's things in the

2001
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,400
security consideration i can always add

2002
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,639
more i'm always open to that i really

2003
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,040
was on the fence somebody jokingly sent

2004
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,120
me i forget what what rc it is now but

2005
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,480
it was an april 1st rfc that had really

2006
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,400
should not

2007
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,559
and

2008
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,920
yeah

2009
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,320
and and i really i i kind of like you

2010
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,520
know

2011
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,360
really should not is what i wanted to

2012
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,360
put there but i was like oh no this is

2013
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,400
you know obviously a joke but it i was

2014
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,199
really on the fence and i just i guess

2015
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,840
maybe i'm maybe i'm just misinterpreting

2016
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,320
the should versus must more as

2017
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,560
uh

2018
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,520
plain english versus what the rfc state

2019
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,760
and so maybe maybe you must not as is

2020
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,360
the right thing and i can i can make

2021
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,880
that change i just

2022
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,360
i i discussed it with some people um

2023
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,800
some experienced ietfers and they they

2024
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,320
didn't even have a definitive answer one

2025
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,239
of them said start with must and see

2026
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,520
where you go and the other one said

2027
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,120
start with should and see where it goes

2028
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,080
so

2029
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,040
i can just i can just change it to must

2030
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:16,159
or must not rather just to be clear

2031
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,520
yes and and

2032
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,040
if the working group has an opinion

2033
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:21,679
that's that's very valid like

2034
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,239
um to have this conversation and decide

2035
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,120
and have a consensus call by the chairs

2036
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:31,440
that is going to you know um motivate

2037
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,440
putting in their must or not master

2038
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:36,880
should there that would help so if i'm

2039
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,880
also like i will have to look at the

2040
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,480
text again too

2041
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:44,000
to have a more definitive opinion but

2042
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,159
yeah

2043
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,320
i think our

2044
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,719
original i mean the whole time it's been

2045
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:52,880
there are people who do this right we

2046
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,159
know that they shouldn't do this but

2047
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,600
there are people who do this and we

2048
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,320
don't want we didn't want to you know

2049
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,880
completely lock them out but

2050
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:03,199
and maybe it's okay to say must not and

2051
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,719
they can still go and do it there's

2052
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:06,159
nothing preventing them from going and

2053
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:07,600
doing it right

2054
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,400
um

2055
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,520
but it

2056
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:12,000
i guess the stance of the ietf should be

2057
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,239
to do something secure and not allow

2058
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,000
them to do something that's

2059
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,239
unsafe right

2060
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:20,480
like that could be um

2061
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:22,000
described in the document without

2062
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,320
normative language

2063
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,800
and say like

2064
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,960
we are aware that exists be like there

2065
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,400
is exist and this is not uh this is not

2066
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,519
recommender or like

2067
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,600
yeah

2068
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,440
yeah there's a lot of this is not

2069
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,320
recommended language in it already i

2070
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,800
think it's i think ben really wants me

2071
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,760
to put

2072
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,480
must not like just do not do this it is

2073
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,400
not it is outside of the specification

2074
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,360
if you do

2075
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:55,839
which i think is fair i think it's fair

2076
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,159
any other comments

2077
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,520
francesca has one more comment i think

2078
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,840
yeah sorry so so from a process point of

2079
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,280
view um i just wanted to say that

2080
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:15,920
uh ben will be stepping down the isg

2081
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,239
tomorrow so his

2082
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,360
blocking discuss will disappear

2083
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:22,719
but i hope that

2084
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,480
we can still

2085
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,480
you know get his input and

2086
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,920
um even though it's not going to be like

2087
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,000
actually blocking the document

2088
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,199
i hope that we can still get his

2089
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,480
yeah like informal approval of some sort

2090
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:40,239
um

2091
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:41,360
but

2092
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,159
yeah we should get to a consensus in the

2093
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,239
working group and then

2094
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:49,480
move forward

2095
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:53,520
from my perspective i i definitely

2096
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,679
respect his opinion and would like to

2097
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,080
have him on board with it so i can i i

2098
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,360
can totally agree with that

2099
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,560
and he's been very helpful in finding

2100
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:06,400
issues with the document in general that

2101
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:09,599
that we fixed up so

2102
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,520

where you have the content providers you

2161
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,880
have commercials at the end so you have

2162
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,560
sales providers

2163
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,560

2173
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,280
get integrations more efficient and try

2174
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:54,639
to get some standardization of how

2175
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:56,800
the different processes of the video

2176
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,560
delivery goes from the content provider

2177
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,560
to the end users

2178
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:01,360
all

2179
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,159
through all these different roles or

2180
01:30:04,159 --> 01:30:07,520
techniques technologies um et cetera so

2181
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:09,760
please next

2182
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,440
so

2183
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,600
at the first let's see the sva open

2184
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:15,280
catching working group was

2185
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,320
paying attention to the cni

2186
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,960
interfaces and metadata uh definitions

2187
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,040
of the different rfcs like a80607

2188
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,520
and 8008 um

2189
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,000
but there was a finding that it was

2190
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
probably needed um

2191
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,960
to cover some gaps that uh trying to put

2192
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,880
all this together for the

2193
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,320
this video service deliveries um

2194
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,199
the interfaces where metadata interfaces

2195
01:30:43,199 --> 01:30:46,320
were not enough uh to cover all those

2196
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,679
needs from content providers from the

2197
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,560
cdns or for the service providers

2198
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,560
this is why

2199
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,800
we were working on this

2200
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,600
extending the metadata that come from

2201
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:02,239
this group to try to to cover all the

2202
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,880
needs from the different

2203
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,960
members of different roles in the video

2204
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,400
delivery

2205
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,560
trying to define um

2206
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:12,320
useful methods to

2207
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,639
make the configurations try to automate

2208
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,120
the configurations to putting this in

2209
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,080
place with our current

2210
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,159
implementations and deployments in in

2211
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,239
real life

2212
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,000
and extending with more advanced

2213
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
configuration publishing

2214
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,560
capabilities um that are required by

2215
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:33,120
content providers trying things like

2216
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,760
publishing versioning of configurations

2217
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,040
and things like that

2218
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,519
please next

2219
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:45,840
yeah well this is very very quick this

2220
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:47,760
is a representation of the of the

2221
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,760
metadata mobile model of the 806 um and

2222
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:55,760
yes i will be very quick uh we haven't

2223
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:57,520
touched any of these

2224
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,400
many structure of the metadata model but

2225
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,600
we live for uh our proposed extensions

2226
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,760
in the genetic met as generic metadata

2227
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,480
objects so

2228
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,880
with taking leverage of this infinite

2229
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,679
extensibility that the interface permits

2230
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:17,360
on the metadata is next

2231
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:20,960
yeah so at the end

2232
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:22,719
all what you have in in the orange

2233
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:24,719
background are the different categories

2234
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:26,639
that we are adding

2235
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:28,719
or we are trying to add with this

2236
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:29,840
extension

2237
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,880
to the metadata model from the cdni we

2238
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,120
will come in in a minute for that this

2239
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,360
next

2240
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,120
so as a summary uh

2241
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,800
i think

2242
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,040
yeah we can go later on this

2243
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,239
past peace

2244
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:48,159
sanjay

2245
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:50,560
yeah one of the things that includes

2246
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,840
this draft

2247
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,320
is what we call it processing stages

2248
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,320
this is a way to permit um to intervene

2249
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,159
in the different processes that happens

2250
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:01,120
when the

2251
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,320
user agent is requesting a content

2252
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,800
to um a cdn or a damson cdm sorry

2253
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,719
how that process will go to an

2254
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:12,480
abstinence cdn origin to get the

2255
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,800
response back from the upstream and that

2256
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,600
response goes to the user ryan by the

2257
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,239
damson cdn these processes that we he

2258
01:33:20,239 --> 01:33:22,719
identified for the steps from the client

2259
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:24,400
requests ordinance requests or any

2260
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:28,320
response on client response we

2261
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,600
defining a way to intervene on those

2262
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:33,120
processes so

2263
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,760
downstream cdn is able to make

2264
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,760
transformations on different parts of

2265
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,679
the of the request

2266
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,000
for instance modifying the the headers

2267
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,920
that goes to the origin when try to get

2268
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,639
the

2269
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:47,199
the the object that is requested or we

2270
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:48,239
are able

2271
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,480
we could be able to modify

2272
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,639
a header in the response to the client

2273
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:53,760
and and

2274
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,440
any other transformation that could be

2275
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:57,040
required for the different use cases

2276
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,120
that are required for this traffic

2277
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:03,559
delegation yes next

2278
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,880
yeah well um

2279
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,280
this is a i'm going to pay

2280
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,000
time here now it's just a representation

2281
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,800
of the

2282
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,920
processing stages model all these leave

2283
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,560
in a generic metadata object

2284
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,400
that is defined defined in the in the

2285
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,840
draft

2286
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,560
so please next

2287
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,000
and this was an example of the host

2288
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,040
index

2289
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:31,600
representing the generic metadata mi

2290
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,000
processing stages and in this example

2291
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,400
you can see that we use

2292
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,719
an expression match as is defined in the

2293
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:40,800
in the draft as a metadata expression

2294
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,080
language

2295
01:34:42,080 --> 01:34:44,239
where for a condition in this case that

2296
01:34:44,239 --> 01:34:47,440
is the response from the origin is 200

2297
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,719
then we will modify the cache policy for

2298
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:52,639
that specific object

2299
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:54,719
so this is an example of what we we

2300
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:57,040
intend to do with this

2301
01:34:57,040 --> 01:35:00,040
next

2302
01:35:00,159 --> 01:35:02,000
yeah and and again well there is a

2303
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,520
definition of the expression language

2304
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,239
with the different operators variables

2305
01:35:06,239 --> 01:35:07,679
or even

2306
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:10,800
built-in functions that could be used um

2307
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,639
for for all these

2308
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,480
modifications this next

2309
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,360
in terms of the capacity capabilities

2310
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:22,639
interface um we have in the these drafts

2311
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,199
have been defined uh a few

2312
01:35:25,199 --> 01:35:27,679
new objects that are required to

2313
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:29,600
the thompson cdn be able to announce to

2314
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,360
the upstream the different capabilities

2315
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,920
regarding these new extensions for the

2316
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:36,080
metadata model that could be required

2317
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,760
for the abstinence to know so for

2318
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,600
instance uh it's important and it could

2319
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,440
be important for the absent to know that

2320
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,440
the processing stages is available or

2321
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,159
not or even it could be important uh to

2322
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,480
ha to the amsterdam to know that a

2323
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,080
subset of the

2324
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:52,639
processing stages is

2325
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:54,840
the dams incident is capable for for

2326
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,960
instance uh it should be important to

2327
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,199
know the amps incident to know if the

2328
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:01,040
spectral language is supported in the

2329
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,000
dumps incident or not maybe it's not but

2330
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:05,840
maybe is able to do some processing

2331
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:07,119
stages

2332
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,679
replacement without expression language

2333
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:12,320
so um there are some

2334
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,600
conditions here that the fci

2335
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,719
interface could not only

2336
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:20,639
announce the capability of a complete

2337
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:23,199
object but of a part of an object

2338
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,839
applicant

2339
01:36:29,199 --> 01:36:30,150
yeah

2340
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:31,679
[Music]

2341
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:34,400
yeah i will not stop here

2342
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:35,920
this is something that will come

2343
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,239
probably next so it's not changing in

2344
01:36:38,239 --> 01:36:41,280
this draft version regarding this but we

2345
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,040
just for you to know the sva and the

2346
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,119
opencasting working group is working on

2347
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:48,639
try to extend

2348
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:51,600
the metadata model with new features

2349
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:54,560
regarding an advanced publishing method

2350
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:56,080
that will meet the content provider a

2351
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:58,960
better management of the configurations

2352
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:00,480
um so probably this is something that

2353
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:03,440
will come in in the following meetings

2354
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,678
please next

2355
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,400
i'm going to insert myself in the queue

2356
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,000
here yeah

2357
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,800
um so i i see that you have uploaded the

2358
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,679
um

2359
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,119
the new revision of the draft right yep

2360
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:18,000
so

2361
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,520
based on and i think you have addressed

2362
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:21,280
some of the comments that were posted

2363
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,960
from the from the last meeting in the

2364
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,000
draft i see that yeah

2365
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,239
okay

2366
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:30,960
okay

2367
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:34,199
next please

2368
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,679
yeah so well that we are version two

2369
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:39,280
what's changed from version one to

2370
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:41,600
version two one of the comments

2371
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,600
that came from the last meeting is that

2372
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,280
uh they could be good to have a

2373
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,520
categorization of the different generic

2374
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,520
metadata objects that we are

2375
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,480
including with this extension uh that

2376
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,280
was a very fair point um so we we have

2377
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,159
made this categorization uh we have

2378
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:00,000
separated different metadata objects

2379
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,800
with

2380
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,679
what these sections like cash control or

2381
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,920
metadata related could catch properties

2382
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,159
management here's the list of the

2383
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,480
different objects in this category the

2384
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,080
origin access

2385
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:14,000
metadata related to the acquisition of

2386
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,360
the content

2387
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,520
client access control in this version of

2388
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,600
the draft there is no generic metadata

2389
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:20,880
object uh

2390
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,280
yet but we did because this is something

2391
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,800
that we in the open catching working

2392
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,119
group are working

2393
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:29,040
on different options

2394
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,960
different objects for this client access

2395
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,440
control uh but they're not

2396
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,679
finished yet so we haven't included in

2397
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:39,199
the draft uh but i think it would we

2398
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,520
think we were good to having in the in

2399
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,400
the as a category here even and is empty

2400
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,800
now but we we will have different

2401
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:49,920
objects in the next version of the draft

2402
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:52,400
edge control genetic metadata to inform

2403
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,800
processing of responses downstream

2404
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,199
so it's a way to

2405
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,280
to the abstinence to condition

2406
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,840
uh the way the thompson cdn could

2407
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,159
respond to a reversal agent request in

2408
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:06,960
the edge uh so this could include

2409
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,280
something like the i will see we will

2410
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,440
see that in a moment for the crossover

2411
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,199
in policy for instance there were some

2412
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:16,400
doubts in the last meeting uh so

2413
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,199
the upstream is able to somehow set the

2414
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:20,960
damp since the end to

2415
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,600
independently of information that are

2416
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,800
that came from the absence indian origin

2417
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:28,480
to enforce

2418
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:29,840
some

2419
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,520
functionality

2420
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:34,239
to the end user request

2421
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,440
okay

2422
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:37,920
processing stages as a complete category

2423
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:40,719
for itself and in general metadata is

2424
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,040
where we include other objects that are

2425
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,000
not

2426
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,080
we haven't found

2427
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,440
a category of the others categories to

2428
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,879
where to put in there okay

2429
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:55,199
yeah we have other

2430
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:57,199
examples to every genetic metadata

2431
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:58,960
object because it was something that in

2432
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:01,280
the version one i think they weren't

2433
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,480
examples

2434
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,239
we have include some minor changes in

2435
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:07,760
the metadata expression language um that

2436
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,760
there is no change in the

2437
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,280
in the

2438
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:14,320
built-in operators or variables uh parts

2439
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,719
but it's just about the in the syntax in

2440
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:19,520
the in the object in the json object

2441
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:21,520
um there is more detailed description

2442
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,600
for processing stages

2443
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,320
uh we have removed from the draft the mi

2444
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,840
requested capacity limits there is

2445
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,360
something that goes in the other draft

2446
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,199
that andrew will be presenting in a

2447
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:34,880
moment uh so we decided to put this out

2448
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,960
of this draft as the capacity um inside

2449
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:42,320
a draft have their own definition of mi

2450
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,639
object that will be extending

2451
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:45,400
the

2452
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:46,960
806

2453
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,119
and we added corrections from the

2454
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:50,719
previous version that was detected in

2455
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:52,880
the revision from the members

2456
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,360
please next

2457
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,719
so i will just go directly if you for

2458
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,480
the sake of the time

2459
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,119
to to one of some of the main doubts

2460
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,040
that were in the in the previous

2461
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,360
meetings uh so

2462
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,480
i i'm open to to discuss any other

2463
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,080
questions if you want um here i i have

2464
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:17,360
asked in the presentation um in the

2465
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,080
first column the section of the version

2466
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,119
one and the section four the section two

2467
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:25,760
so version two sorry uh because we go up

2468
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,679
we have categorized all the objects then

2469
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:30,080
section numbering has completely changed

2470
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,840
uh so yeah for the sake that you can

2471
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,600
find the reference of the of the

2472
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,679
previous questions on the last meeting

2473
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:37,199
um

2474
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:42,080
so i i will i will go to the section 232

2475
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,520
the third line there

2476
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:44,400
um

2477
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,280
about aloe compress and this there was a

2478
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:51,040
concern about this object from kevin um

2479
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,239
and

2480
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,000
yeah there was a very fair point of the

2481
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,639
doubt here the thing is that uh we have

2482
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,600
found that this object allo compress

2483
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,280
that we still have it in the in the

2484
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,760
version 200 with that name

2485
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,560
that name does not reflect correctly the

2486
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:07,840
function that

2487
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,880
is expected for a dumb abstinence cdn to

2488
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,719
use this object

2489
01:42:12,719 --> 01:42:15,040
the idea of this object of the

2490
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:17,920
functionality is that the upstream cdn

2491
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,880
enforces the dumpster cdn to compress a

2492
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:24,400
response to the end user if the user has

2493
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,080
sent the access encoding header

2494
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:27,360
correctly

2495
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,560
but independently if the origin has sent

2496
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,560
the response to the downstream

2497
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,000
uncompressed

2498
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,560
so it's like delegating the compression

2499
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,119
of the an object in the damson cdn in

2500
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,520
the response to the to the end user

2501
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,199
independently of what the origin is

2502
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:47,840
doing okay uh probably this will um ha

2503
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,920
made the abstinent to not dedicate

2504
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,760
resources to the compression and

2505
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:54,080
delegate that to the dumpster in cdn

2506
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:54,960
okay

2507
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:57,840
so uh for sure the name allo compress is

2508
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,199
confusing um uh we are working on

2509
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,280
changing the name so we still don't have

2510
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:03,920
a

2511
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:06,080
a final name with this but something

2512
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:08,480
like edge compress or first compress

2513
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,239
will be more suitable for the use case

2514
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:12,560
that is especially for this object uh so

2515
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:13,840
probably will be changing the next

2516
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:16,480
version of the draft um

2517
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,280
for other the next section 211 the cash

2518
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,280
policy and there is another one in the

2519
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,719
next slide that this is the negative

2520
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,719
catch policy

2521
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:25,920
this is

2522
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:29,679
something similar related to um

2523
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,320
to what the origin is doing uh of the in

2524
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,800
the upstream and what the

2525
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:36,960
upstream cdn wants the dumpster incident

2526
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,880
to do

2527
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:41,199
all these cash

2528
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,440
cash policies are related to cash

2529
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:45,840
control headers in the responses

2530
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:48,080
typically the origin could send a cash

2531
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,920
control that

2532
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,840
is the same that should be sent to the

2533
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,760
end user right

2534
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,199
but the thing is that there are use

2535
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,520
cases where the upstream

2536
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,840
wants the dumbstream to have a different

2537
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,199
behavior regarding the cache

2538
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:05,840
in this case this is regarding the time

2539
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,920
to leave of the objects in the dumps in

2540
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,560
cdn cuts so independently of what is

2541
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,520
sent to the end user in the response to

2542
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,080
the request the upstream needs to say

2543
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:18,159
the downstream to change the way that

2544
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:20,159
it's behave the cuts so there are some

2545
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:23,600
examples um that that we have found in

2546
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,639
in real life in in our

2547
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,560
production services deployed is like um

2548
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,280
for instance an upstream wants to have a

2549
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,400
catch control zero or no cash no store

2550
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:37,679
for the

2551
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,719
local catching the end user but they

2552
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:43,280
don't want to receive a huge amount of

2553
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,040
requests from the dumpster

2554
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:47,119
so they prefer to

2555
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:50,400
maintain in a double stream a ttl of

2556
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:52,159
let's say one minute

2557
01:44:52,159 --> 01:44:55,119
while the end user received

2558
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:58,159
a no catch no store

2559
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:00,960
why why damstring could do that because

2560
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,199
at the same time the hamstring

2561
01:45:03,199 --> 01:45:05,920
using the cni or any other method

2562
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,320
available is able to make content

2563
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,480
management of the downstream

2564
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,080
so

2565
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:13,679
they don't need that the damsen

2566
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,520
continues to revalidate the object

2567
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,880
because if they need to change the

2568
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,239
object they can use the content

2569
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:19,920
management to do that

2570
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:22,560
and that way the downstream block or

2571
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,080
stop the huge amount of requests from

2572
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:29,280
the end users and is not disturbing the

2573
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,080
origin server so this catch control

2574
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,520
policies or the negative patch

2575
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,760
controllers policies is intended for

2576
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,880
that so a way to change the behavior of

2577
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:40,719
the dams in terms of the ttl of the

2578
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,000
objects

2579
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,560
without changing what is intended for

2580
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,800
the industrial request

2581
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,320
so please next uh sanjay

2582
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,600
yeah

2583
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,480
this section um this is two three one

2584
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,840
one is regarding the gross origin policy

2585
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:01,119
um the doubt from here from kevin was

2586
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:03,119
in the description was not very clear we

2587
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:05,119
have tried to change the description to

2588
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:06,800
have a more clear understanding of the

2589
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,719
reason of this

2590
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:11,119
the course the cross-origin policies

2591
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:13,520
that this came from

2592
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,800
from the http fetch standard

2593
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,760
the the definition of what comes in the

2594
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,080
origin header in a request

2595
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,239
when there is a fetch in the browser or

2596
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:26,159
in a player in a client that is making

2597
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:27,360
the request

2598
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,920
the origin header include is included in

2599
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,880
that request and there is not the

2600
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:34,719
service um

2601
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,000
url it's not what is defined in the host

2602
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,080
in the course only in a host match

2603
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:41,760
because the upstream one is delegating a

2604
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,560
host match is delegating the service of

2605
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,639
the request for a video content for

2606
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,880
instance or for another object

2607
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:52,719
but the origin header is related to the

2608
01:46:52,719 --> 01:46:54,880
url of the

2609
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:56,880
you know how the client access that

2610
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,280
content in the in a video platform or in

2611
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,239
a web page so in an example you could

2612
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:05,000
the client could access the video

2613
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,639
platform.example.com

2614
01:47:06,639 --> 01:47:09,040
but the host match is

2615
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:12,040
videodelivery.example.com

2616
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,360
so the request goes to

2617
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,199
videodelivery.sample.com

2618
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:17,440
that would be the host match that is

2619
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:20,080
delegated but the origin header included

2620
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,840
by the browser or the player could be

2621
01:47:24,119 --> 01:47:25,840
videoplatform.example.com so in that

2622
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:26,639
case

2623
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,119
we cannot relate the course with the

2624
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,600
host match because it's not going to be

2625
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,320
that it's going to be where the content

2626
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:35,520
is published

2627
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,119
publishing on internet so

2628
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:41,760
why it's the schema and the domain name

2629
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,080
and port is because that is how it's

2630
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:47,920
related in the http fetcher standard

2631
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,440
well we have tried to explain this

2632
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:52,000
better so hopefully the multi are now so

2633
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,320
whatever you can find later we can we

2634
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,040
can discuss can we wrap up quickly um

2635
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:59,600
yeah i will try to finish yeah

2636
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,239
yes next um

2637
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:03,760
i'm trying to find something more

2638
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,400
important uh catch policies is

2639
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:07,920
explaining before

2640
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:12,320
yeah some correction yes please next

2641
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,679
yeah there are some questions about

2642
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,000
including something in the registry for

2643
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
different options one was for the

2644
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,360
private fetchers um is my point here is

2645
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,159
that

2646
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,239
private features is something that is

2647
01:48:26,239 --> 01:48:28,400
more a point to point so from one

2648
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,159
specific abstinence to one specific

2649
01:48:30,159 --> 01:48:31,840
downstream cdn

2650
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,920
because our private features probably

2651
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,520
from the dumpster so i don't think it's

2652
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,520
needed to have a private a public

2653
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,400
registry for for those private features

2654
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:43,920
because of that because i think they are

2655
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,639
not generic and by definition

2656
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,560
there was another comment regarding and

2657
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:50,000
the traffic type

2658
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,239
this is a generic um

2659
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,440
this is a video specific configuration

2660
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,880
and we're talking about

2661
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:00,920
generic probably generic

2662
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:03,119
we can discuss later if you want by the

2663
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:04,880
mailing list i think that's a good point

2664
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:07,040
there isn't here an explanation but we

2665
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:10,880
can discuss so this is next

2666
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,599
yeah and that's it very quick i'm sorry

2667
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:17,119
uh for the sake of the time but please

2668
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,880
i'm i'm more than welcome to to use the

2669
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,880
mailing list to for whatever requirement

2670
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,960
that you want um

2671
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:25,679
and in the last slide please sanjay that

2672
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,040
is where

2673
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:30,080
we find that in this draft person is

2674
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:32,639
good enough to to plant uh to have this

2675
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,880
adopted as a working group draft

2676
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,599
uh all the realistic concerns

2677
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:39,440
maybe we can use the middle east to to

2678
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,199
discuss around this

2679
01:49:41,199 --> 01:49:43,360
um thank you

2680
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,199
what i would suggest is that if you can

2681
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:47,440
put those uh questions that kevin had

2682
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,639
and the answers you have in the mailing

2683
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,880
list i think that would you know at

2684
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,840
least create a record there and yeah

2685
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,760
you know that have similar questions

2686
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,480
maybe answered it in in that manner and

2687
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,000
then we can um

2688
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,520
you know um

2689
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,920
take up your question of uh adopting

2690
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,440
this into the mailing list

2691
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,280
kevin what do you think

2692
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,880
i think um

2693
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,480
thank you for thank you for the updates

2694
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:12,000
i haven't had a chance to go over the

2695
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,159
full draft the

2696
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,719
the the groupings are great i think that

2697
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:19,119
the other thing then is do we want to

2698
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:20,560
break it up into multiple drafts right

2699
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,480
now it's a 90-page draft and there's a

2700
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:25,679
lot of stuff in there and

2701
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:26,719
there are things we could probably

2702
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:28,159
accelerate some of the metadata are

2703
01:50:28,159 --> 01:50:30,400
probably easier to push through um if we

2704
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,880
do them as separate pieces um

2705
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,159
some of the stuff that's more fleshed

2706
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,360
out

2707
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,320
we should consider that i think um

2708
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:39,679
versus the

2709
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:41,440
the mono draft

2710
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:43,920
which is which is very hard and

2711
01:50:43,920 --> 01:50:45,760
especially with the um

2712
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,760
the stages which i think are interesting

2713
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,119
i think that's good stuff but that is

2714
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:50,639
going to take a lot longer i think than

2715
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:51,599
just pushing through some of the

2716
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,080
metadata that's helpful for you guys

2717
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,679
okay okay

2718
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,639
okay we we will discuss it then and

2719
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,719
with the other co-authors so what what

2720
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,119
what would come plan to do with breaking

2721
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:05,360
out in different drafts

2722
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,560
okay

2723
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,800
thank you alfonso thank you

2724
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,639
great job

2725
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,960
all right last but not least andrew you

2726
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:15,119
have the remainder of the time

2727
01:51:15,119 --> 01:51:17,199
saving the worst

2728
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,280
um i guess for the last

2729
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,840
yeah yeah i'm gonna do this actually a

2730
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:23,199
lot of the

2731
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:24,800
back story and just kind of go right

2732
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,000
into the changes

2733
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,920
so this is the

2734
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:33,440
version of the draft we're considering

2735
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,560
it's the

2736
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,760
capacity insights extension version 2.

2737
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,800
next slide please

2738
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,000
as part of this the this the draft has

2739
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:45,840
actually been simplified a bit we've cut

2740
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:46,639
out

2741
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:48,239
one of the main concepts which was

2742
01:51:48,239 --> 01:51:50,159
allowing an upstream

2743
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:52,400
to ask the downstream to reconsider

2744
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,560
capacity limits uh we weren't

2745
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:57,280
necessarily confident in

2746
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,800
the approach we were taking so we

2747
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:01,280
decided to strike it out

2748
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,960
just to make it a little more clear and

2749
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:06,719
concise uh next slide please

2750
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:09,599
so the component that was related to

2751
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:11,679
that which was struck out is the mi

2752
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:13,840
requested capacity limits object once

2753
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:16,400
again we just didn't feel we had a a

2754
01:52:16,400 --> 01:52:18,000
good enough grasp on how it would be

2755
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,920
used effectively to um communicate

2756
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:24,000
or allow the upstream to ask the

2757
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,520
downstream to

2758
01:52:25,520 --> 01:52:27,760
reconsider adjustments

2759
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,400
uh next slide please

2760
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:34,800
this it represents one of the two

2761
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,719
extensions we're looking to make to the

2762
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,599
fcvi uh capacity limits payloads uh the

2763
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:41,679
this is the capacity limits it is the

2764
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:45,119
main driver for allowing a downstream to

2765
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,880
communicate to an upstream

2766
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:47,840
of

2767
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,360
utilization goals they should be

2768
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,440
targeting

2769
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:54,239
next slide please

2770
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,960
this is the uh the delta of

2771
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:01,920
the json structure from the last draft

2772
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,360
on the left you'll see that there were

2773
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:04,960
some hard-coded

2774
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,679
sections of total limits and host limits

2775
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:10,080
we've decided to try and generize that

2776
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:13,360
slightly by moving those over into

2777
01:53:13,360 --> 01:53:16,320
generic limits objects and then identify

2778
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,040
or

2779
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:20,159
adopting a new subscope to those limits

2780
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:22,080
so you can see here on the right hand

2781
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:24,800
side there is a scope object which

2782
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,360
is of type published host with several

2783
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:30,000
values this allows um

2784
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,679
a more granular

2785
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,840
scoping of

2786
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:36,960
a capacity within a cdni footprint

2787
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:39,599
sometimes that we found that that wasn't

2788
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:41,440
necessarily um

2789
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:43,840
granular enough to meet certain needs so

2790
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,280
we decided to

2791
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,719
allow within that footprint a subscoping

2792
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:50,400
and this is the vehicle that we've

2793
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:51,920
identified for that

2794
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:55,119
next slide please

2795
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,960
uh this object hasn't changed since the

2796
01:53:56,960 --> 01:53:59,520
last version of the draft this is a an

2797
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,840
object which is meant to

2798
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,280
advertise

2799
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:05,760
telemetry source capabilities and this

2800
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:07,679
is relevant in that

2801
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,840
the capacity limits were advertising

2802
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,599
we've we felt that there was a strong

2803
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:14,560
correlation with correlating that to a

2804
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,639
uh a telemetry source so there was no

2805
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:19,199
ambiguity between what capacity

2806
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:22,000
advertisement were specifying and how to

2807
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,760
measure the utilization against that

2808
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:26,800
limit um so this

2809
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,040
this is really a foundation for further

2810
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:31,280
work which we have yet to um

2811
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:33,760
put forward but we we felt it was very

2812
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,599
relevant in this case and wanted to lay

2813
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,760
the foundation for it here next slide

2814
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,080
please

2815
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,040
uh once again this is a diagram from the

2816
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,639
last presentation just kind of goes

2817
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:45,760
through the over

2818
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,040
overview of

2819
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:49,119
what we how we anticipate this to work

2820
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:51,040
really the the upstream would be polling

2821
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,760
the downstream to ask for

2822
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,639
the

2823
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,639
capabilities of

2824
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,400
and within those capabilities we would

2825
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,880
include capacity limits

2826
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:03,119
the upstream would then also be looking

2827
01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:06,239
to consume telemetry data that related

2828
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,480
to the specific capacity limits combine

2829
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:10,159
those two data points together to make

2830
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:14,000
sure that there is sufficient um

2831
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,760
sufficient capacity in order to delegate

2832
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,760
requests to the downstream

2833
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,480
next slide please

2834
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,159
um

2835
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:24,960
once again this is the the

2836
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,040
diagram which allow or shows how the

2837
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,440
downstream would reflect changes to

2838
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,520
capabilities to the upstream

2839
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,239
relies upon a callback mechanism and a

2840
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:36,480
subscription service

2841
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:37,840
handled by the upstream in the

2842
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,119
downstream

2843
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:42,480
uh next slide please

2844
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:45,040
uh once again this is just a call out to

2845
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,199
the fact that we had removed the mi

2846
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:49,040
requested capacity limits object from

2847
01:55:49,040 --> 01:55:51,360
this uh version of the draft

2848
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,239
and next slide please

2849
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:55,840
and that is it all right i made it in

2850
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,000
five minutes all right

2851
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,280
good job andrew

2852
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,360
thank you

2853
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,320
um

2854
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:07,920
any any comments um

2855
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,520
so i encourage everyone i haven't had a

2856
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,280
chance to look at the updated draft

2857
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,199
myself uh everyone please go out and

2858
01:56:13,199 --> 01:56:16,320
read the updated metadata and capacity

2859
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:19,040
drafts and send comments to the list

2860
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,360
please um

2861
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,960
i think

2862
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,239
we should

2863
01:56:24,239 --> 01:56:26,880
we we should we should see um you know

2864
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,480
if we can get some more comments out
