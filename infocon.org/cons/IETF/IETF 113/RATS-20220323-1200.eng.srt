1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
doing a third person walking in the room

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,200
and

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,639
and it's starting time

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,920
so we will

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,080
wait two minutes and then we will get

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
started

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
hopefully just a little bit too fun of

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,160
an evening as opposed to uh more people

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,519
down

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,720
uh uh yeah let's be optimistic and we'll

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,840
go with that kathleen

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
what's that

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
i see somebody in the room

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,440
what so

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
there are now three people

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,039
i was kind of joking sorry about that

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,239
signing

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
for her

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
okay physically there are five people in

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
the room

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,480
seven if you count those chairs

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,920
how's that

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
i just was not counting the chairs

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
oh i i'm not worried so kathleen the the

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,439
the reason for the leakness is we're

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,798
just coming off the lunch break

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
okay that makes sense

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
you can close a few things you know

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,280
put out issues that you don't need

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
anybody to argue with

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,320
that's right that's yeah

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
and assign new actions

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
yeah i have no problems assigning

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
actions it's chasing the people to make

35
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,479
sure they get addressed

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,199
with the weather being so nice

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,120
today

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,920
oh

39
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,319
do you think people are out walking

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,280
is the weather yeah

41
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,640
or maybe they're just shocked by the

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,560
nice weather so they're taking advantage

43
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
of the good

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
letter okay it's two past the hour

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,760
people are straggling into the room

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,120
hopefully those that are remote you can

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
hear

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
myself and therefore ned

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,120
um let me just do a volume check

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
hopefully you guys can hear me okay

51
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,760
nancy

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
yes nancy you and ned are loud and clear

53
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
this is roman speaking

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
awesome yeah we we got a big room today

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
um

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,840
so with that let's just go ahead and get

57
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
started because people will just start

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
struggling in

59
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,440
okay so in case you weren't aware this

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,239
is uh session number two for rats

61
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
and we're going to uh

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
just go through some of the slides so

63
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,680
there's the notewell

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
information everybody should be familiar

65
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,920
with that

66
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,239
there's some meeting tips in the chair

67
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,440
slides

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
mostly just a reminder to those who are

69
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,000
attending in person to please wear your

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,080
mask

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
consideration of the others in the room

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,840
masks are supposedly well not supposedly

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
they are mandatory for us

74
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
that are on site okay and then uh

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,959
there's uh you know pointers to the

76
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,159
various

77
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,040
um

78
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,319
information

79
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,920
and materials for the meeting that are

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
also in the chair slides

81
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,400
and we should be familiar with the code

82
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,319
of conduct so we're going to move along

83
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,720
it to the agenda

84
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
which is here

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
so

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
so our our first topic is going to be uh

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
uccs and ujcs

88
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
for eat

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and uh jerry is going to be presenting

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,759
that so

91
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
well we let's make sure

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,479
so this is the agenda bash

93
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,840
so hopefully

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,639
uh let's just do a quick check

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,160
everybody by now should have looked at

96
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,960
the agenda you're okay

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,040
going once going twice

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,600
so with that we can move forward and and

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400

sorry giddy with that we can uh go ahead

124

126
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960

thanks so

128
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
there is so justin

129
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
by the way even though i'm presenting

130
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
this is on behalf of the eats editors

131
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,039
myself uh jeremy lawrence

132
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,280
so as most people know there are two

133
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,520
standards track working group documents

134
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
for attestation tokens and rats one is

135
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,080
geet and the other is the uccs

136
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,400
specification which hank went over from

137
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
the status yesterday that stands for

138
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
unsigned seaboard claim set

139
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,520
and our goal

140
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
particularly as we're trying to drive

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,680
beats towards completion is to establish

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,000
a relationship between these documents

143
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
and as hank went over yesterday there's

144
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,319
an assumption even though the document

145
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,880
is titled uccs that unsigned json

146
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,280
claimsets are also uh also should be

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
supported

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,039
um so just for the purposes of this

149
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
presentation when i use uccs it covers

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
both unsigned c-more and unselling json

151
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
we could go to the next slide please

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,880
so a couple of premises here

153
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,680
first is uccs is scope data station it's

154
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
not a generic method to send unsigned

155
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,639
cwt claims

156
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,319
arbitrarily

157
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,759
um

158
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
the use the current uccs draft makes it

159
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
very clear

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,919
about this limitation

161
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:18,960
um

162
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
and uh i'm not going to read that

163
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,960
read that text i think everybody can see

164
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,840
that

165
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,000
but um i think moreover this is a

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,599
working group document

167
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,319
and therefore is actually scoped

168
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
according to the current rats charter

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
so uh

170
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,680
that's one premise

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,599
the second premise uh if we go to the

172
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,759
next slide

173
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,280
uccs does not always require a mutually

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,520
authenticated secure transport

175
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,639
um

176
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,120
now the front matter of uccs document

177
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
does state

178
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,280
uh the benefits of a mutually secure

179
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
channel but uh

180
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
but uh but this is actually more of a

181
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,560
security consideration but uh but in the

182
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
opinion of the editors it should not be

183
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
a normative requirement

184
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,199
um

185
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,280
the reason this ties into eat is because

186
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,800
eat makes no

187
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
normative uh require cases no no

188
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,080
requirements on the uh transport layer

189
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
so um i give an example there where uh

190
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
uccs may be acceptable in a one-way

191
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,080
authenticated tls session

192
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,800
as an example and obviously in the web

193
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
today to one way authenticated tls is

194
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
is uh is

195
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
quite common

196
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
okay we go to the next slide

197
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,760
so eat is the rat standards track for

198
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,120
conveying a

199
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,640
standard track method for conveying

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,760
attestation methods

201
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,959
evidence

202
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
and as per this occur as for the uh

203
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,600
as per the current and what has been

204
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
documented and has been there for yes

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
probably a year

206
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
um

207
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,839
maybe even more

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,959
each can take three forms one as a as a

209
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,959
cwt jwt or as the uccs

210
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,480
therefore each has a normative

211
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,959
dependency it's a dependency on the ucs

212
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,399
uccs definition and therefore we have a

213
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,959
dependency on a stable cdl description

214
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,800
which is consistent with the rest of it

215
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,160
let's go to the next slide please

216
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
eat is silent on normative requirements

217
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,360
for underlying transport as i mentioned

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
but there are there is a security

219
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
consideration section

220
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,279
this is

221
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,519
you know heat is general purpose not a

222
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,480
uh not all heat transports can it can be

223
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,839
guaranteed to be through a mutually

224
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
authenticated secure tunnel um

225
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
i've worked you know i'm working

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
personally on bluetooth implementations

227
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,839
for instance and that would be a prime

228
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,920
example where mutual mutual

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
authentication

230
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,399
um

231
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,959
is not uh it is not always feasible at

232
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,440
least not in the way that you expect

233
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,680
with the ttos

234
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,480
or dtls connection

235
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
um

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
the other thing too that the editors

237
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
will concede is that the e document

238
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,640
itself can't pro will probably not do

239
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
justice to all the security sector

240
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
considerations

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,680
around transport uh of unsigned claim

242
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,519
sets and not even just transport but

243
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,560
when

244
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
it actually makes sense

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,360
to use on to use on clients unsigned

246
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,760
claim sets and when it doesn't and it's

247
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,279
our opinion as the editors that that

248
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,959
actually would be better covered in a

249
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
different in a different dedicated draft

250
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
so

251
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,760
let's go to the next slide yes go ahead

252
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,800
you you've got dave taylor on thecube

253
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,720
so dave did you

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
yeah guys

255
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,040
hey dave did you have a comment about

256
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,399
the slide

257
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
uh actually it's on the previous slide

258
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
i was trying to wait for a pause

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
uh my uh

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
yeah sorry i uh uh i waited to put my

261
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
hand up because i was checking the

262
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,399
document and my question

263
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
is just a question on the top bullet

264
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
there

265
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,880
where

266
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
it says eat is the method for conveying

267
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,399
attestation evidence right the working

268
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,000
group has had a bunch of discussions

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
about use of eat for attestation results

270
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,160
so the question i was going to ask is is

271
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
there any use cases where you might

272
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,000
where uccs might actually apply to

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
attestation results

274
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,760
there is actually a sentence in the uccs

275
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
uh document right now that only mentions

276
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
evidence and that's why i bring it up

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,160
because if there exists any use cases um

278
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,120
for eat in uh for attestation results

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
where uccs might make sense then we

280
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,800
might want a word smith to that one

281
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,639
sentence and that's in the uccs document

282
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,839
right now but i don't know if there's

283
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,480
any use cases for uccs with attestation

284
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
results yeah so

285
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,079
yeah so lawrence actually discussed a

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
little bit about b2b uh

287
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
b2b um relationships between a verifier

288
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
and a relying party

289
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,680
once again it's kind of dependent on

290
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
what the uh i want the uh security

291
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,120
considerations are in that in that kind

292
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
of setup it could be

293
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
that what we're considering mutual

294
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
mutual authentication could be handled

295
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,279
if something different from the

296
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,920
transport layer for instance one-way tls

297
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,959
i mentioned

298
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
uh plus

299
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
um maybe an over-the-top authentication

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
uh accompanied by an over top

301
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
authentication like a username password

302
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,519
or one-time password um

303
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,040
so that would still be mutually

304
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,880
authenticated and that's the case and

305
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,839
you you then then uccs could be used in

306
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,519
the trade in the conveyance of that

307
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,880
station results

308
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,360
in that uh in that particular scenario

309
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,800
okay so yeah

310
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,480
if we think there could be some case

311
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,079
there's just one sentence in the

312
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,360
introduction

313
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
uh which says that it discusses

314
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,519
conditions for its you know ucs proper

315
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,279
use in the scope of rats and the

316
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,040
conveyance of evidence from a tester to

317
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
a verifier and we might want to amend

318
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,360
that as to make it either have two

319
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,800
examples or just make that be for

320
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
example to not overly constrain it

321
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
because i think all the rest of uc's

322
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,880
test would apply if there's actually a

323
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,079
use case so

324
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
yeah yeah that's fine i appreciate the

325
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
comment dave yeah i i didn't want to get

326
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,200
to

327
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
since i knew that the attestation

328
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
results uh uh

329
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
discussion

330
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
uh was a whole separate topic i didn't

331
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,079
want to actually mention that in this

332
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
slide but

333
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,880
yeah

334
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
that's why my comment is more on the

335
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
introduction of the actual document

336
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
itself which was triggered by the uh

337
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,600
point in the slide so all right thank

338
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
you

339
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
okay um

340
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,720
so let's go to the uh

341
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
let's go

342
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,360
let's go to the uh next slide here

343
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
you mean the one after oh yeah you know

344
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,959
pretty pretty sorry

345
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,480
i think you're less could you go back

346
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,920
for one slide

347
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
let me see if i covered this

348
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,279
um

349
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,120
yeah no we we covered this here okay

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,040
let's go to the next one let's get to

351
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
delete

352
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,079
okay so here's the editor's

353
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,360
recommendation

354
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,760
the e document can provide the cdl

355
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,839
description for unsigned claim sets

356
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,120
covering uh

357
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,000
for both cwt and jwt

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,199
um

359
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,880
the document will incorporate the

360
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
request diana for the seaboard json tag

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,360
to identify unsigned claim sets

362
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,720
and

363
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,519
the current uccs document would refocus

364
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,399
on only security uh considerations for

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,480
unsigned claims and it could be

366
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,720
informational track and

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,639
and it could even you know could also

368
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,440
cover

369
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
uh some of the scenarios that dave was

370
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
just now mentioning which is with your

371
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
respect to uh not just attestation

372
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,160
evidence but at station results

373
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,040
so

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
if we go to the next slide

375
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,160
so why this change um

376
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,959
we

377
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,240
the eat document requires uh it

378
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
only requires a stable cdl description

379
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
of uccs and we're confident that it

380
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,120
exists today thank you hank

381
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,600
and uh and the other utc

382
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,800
uccs editors for working through that

383
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,360
um the security considerations for uccs

384
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,199
though are

385
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,880
i think we're uh in my opinion we're

386
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
only just beginning and you know the

387
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
editors also feel that too

388
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,279
it may not close very quickly

389
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,920
and the other thing too is we don't want

390
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,959
to uh see any implementers who actually

391
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,120
require the uccs

392
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,680
option today to get held up

393
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,880
um

394
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
we do believe eat can go to rfc with the

395
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,759
reference to the uccsid and its security

396
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,399
considerations and

397
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
and that's that would be assuming that

398
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,480
the working group acts on the

399
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,800
recommendations of the previous slide

400
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,639
and

401
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,360
uccs document can then start to actually

402
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,240
uh look more comprehensively at all the

403
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
uh and all the transfer security

404
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,680
considerations

405
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
you know i mentioned where one way off

406
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,720
the sufficient that's at the transport

407
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,600
layer uh i mentioned an example where uh

408
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
where uh the auth and the other

409
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,040
direction could be happening at the

410
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,120
application layer uh just now my

411
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,959
response today

412
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,800
rule role of the root of trust in

413
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,360
security transport

414
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
which is really one of the major

415
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
considerations in actually uh in

416
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,399
actually coming up with the ucts concept

417
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,560
in the first place

418
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,560
i believe that's it for this slide

419
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,800
for this slide deck

420
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,759
do we want to pause for our questions i

421
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,360
i think we're

422
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,040
at time

423
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
yeah we are at time but um

424
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,920
let's take two minutes for questions

425
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
it looks like there are two on the queue

426
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,680
they're two on the queue too so

427
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,639
okay

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,680
roman you're on the queue

429
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
uh hi gary i just had a quick question

430
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,839
about the

431
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,279
the security considerations of uccs in

432
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,319
each

433
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,319
is that normative or informative what's

434
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,959
the nature of that my concern is

435
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,160
yeah sorry

436
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,599
if it's it would

437
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
yeah good

438
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,799
document in this round sure

439
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
it would be informative

440
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,439
he

441
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
mainly because like

442
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
mainly because i think it's a it's an

443
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
involving uh

444
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,640
it's an evolving use case we really

445
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
don't know

446
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
uh we really don't have a full grasp of

447
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,280
the

448
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,320
uh of all the different geese usage

449
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
scenarios of utcs um you know dave just

450
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,360
mentioned out of station results where i

451
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,720
do think uccs that it can play a role um

452
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,799
but uh yeah it would be

453
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,120
security considerations i always view

454
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
in the context of heat i would view as

455
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,039
informative um part of the thing part of

456
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,360
the reason is that

457
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,640
eat itself since it's based on cdbt is

458
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
what is what i sometimes refer to as a

459
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,640
self-defending payload

460
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,320
so a deployer could actually it could

461
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
actually have no dependencies on the

462
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
transport layer at all they could they

463
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
could encrypt it they could uh they

464
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,320
could sign it and it could be it could

465
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,160
go over multiple transport layers of

466
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,120
varying security is varying security

467
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,520
levels and security insurances i should

468
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,720
say and uh still be

469
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,520
still be uh as secure as the application

470
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,720
calls for

471
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,039
okay perfect thank you for clarifying

472
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,679
okay so in in the queue oh somebody

473
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
dropped off i've got kathleen

474
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200

475
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,440
end that's not a problem you can be what

476
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
i can be at the end that is not a

477
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,360
problem so for those on site just so

478
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,440
that i can keep a better order if you

479
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
can get yourself on the queue on the

480
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,640
meet echo

481
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,200
oh so yeah no no no that's okay i know

482
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,520
for you you're after kathleen so

483
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
kathleen

484
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
you're next

485
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,039
all right thank you so just a couple of

486
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,679
clarifying questions um just and i was

487
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
taking notes at the same time so it

488
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
might be just that i missed something so

489
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
i apologize if that's the case so you

490
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,320
mentioned the e authors wanting to fold

491
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
this into the eat draft i would be

492
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
against that

493
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,919
um just in the

494
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
cons the the amount of time taken

495
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,919
um

496
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,200
and then

497
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
i guess we'd also need to understand

498
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
since it references this

499
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,440
what's going to be the hold up um

500
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
for this document to complete for eat

501
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,799
and personally i'd just like to see eat

502
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,480
make some quick progress and and

503
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,880
get through final publication soon

504
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
so i'm just looking to see how do we

505
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,200
scope things and and how do we

506
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,880
i guess understand the timelines

507
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
so that's as a as a chair right so i'm

508
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,679
just trying to understand timeline yeah

509
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
well well i'm not saying uh i didn't say

510
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
fold the entire uccs document into eat i

511
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,080
just said i i just said the cddl

512
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,520
description i think uh utcs continues

513
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
as a separate uh working group document

514
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
um

515
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,280
that is the hold up right there you

516
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
we don't uh

517
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
we think we have we think we can

518
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
actually complete the cdl description

519
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,720
for this i don't know really uh

520
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
i don't know really

521
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,480
you know how that would how that would

522
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
take shape on the uccs document and

523
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,960
there is a normative dependency in the

524
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,799
document so

525
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,919
um

526
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,520
i didn't put that in there as an

527
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
alternative

528
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,720
because i i mean because the editors

529
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
feel that the the editors have agreed

530
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
that this is actually uh

531
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,080
this is actually the

532
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,679
least painful path

533
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,200
but uh

534
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
you know the other alternative is to

535
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
eliminate all the normative dependencies

536
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,320
on uccs

537
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,760
but um

538
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,159
i think that's uh that's going to be not

539
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,080
fun either for uh for implementers

540
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,120
because uh

541
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
because um because any implementer comes

542
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
to each document

543
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
they may do and they may they may first

544
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,559
ask okay well what if i don't want to

545
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,679
sign this

546
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,919
then assign this token

547
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,159
then you get into uglier situations

548
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,200
where

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,039
an implementer might actually uh

550
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,320
implement uh

551
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,840
things that have killed us in the past

552
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,039
on tls uh security such as uh null

553
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
ciphers which i think we really want to

554
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
invite i'm i'm gonna have to call time

555
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
in and

556
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,960
i'm to give it one more minute to give

557
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,840
the

558
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,760
i can't speak for the draft since i'm an

559
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,080
author but since i'm running the queue

560
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,240
i would like carsten and hank as the

561
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,720
other authors to speak for the uucs

562
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,159
draft

563
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,559
and then i'm cutting the queue

564
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
yeah

565
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,679
i have a

566
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,320
uh practical problem and a more more

567
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
fundamental problem the practical

568
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,960
problem is that there is some some weird

569
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,760
stuff in section 8 of of the current

570
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,520
heat draft i don't know if there is

571
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,280
anything new

572
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
out there but i think we will need a

573
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,600
little bit of time to to clean this

574
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,880
stuff up

575
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,480
um if if we want to go forward with that

576
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,200
but the more fundamental problem is

577
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
uh that that cwt actually was

578
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
meant to be a general purpose

579
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
specification

580
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
and i see a certain tendency of this

581
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,799
working group to pull this stuff in and

582
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,320
essentially claim

583
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
cwt and and uh

584
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
kind of merge eat and cwt and

585
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,840
there are some good reasons to do that

586
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
but there are also some good reasons not

587
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,200
to do that in the extent that that

588
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,600
pulling over the cdl into the the

589
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,799
document

590
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,320
uh what would provide so if we can get a

591
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
clean separation between

592
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,080
cwt as a basic mechanism and the cwt

593
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,840
extensions that the e-document provides

594
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,799
then i would be much happier

595
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,320
i'll comment that this is a working

596
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,640
group document therefore it is narrowly

597
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
scoped to the working group charter it

598
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
is not a gene it can not be a

599
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
replacement to cwt in any and all use

600
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,559
cases similar is

601
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,799
my interpretation applies to uccs as

602
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,679
well

603
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,559
but

604
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,679
okay yeah i understand going yeah hank

605
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:23,679
can be really quick because we do need

606
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
to close in sure

607
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,919
um just to reinforce what carson said is

608
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,159
that the uccs

609
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,000
is for cwt

610
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
and we have an application scenario that

611
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,960
is why we're doing the first uccs core

612
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,919
id

613
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,120
in rats

614
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,039
and that's the usage and threat model

615
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,640
and the security consideration of rats

616
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,799
because a uccs

617
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,720
may and must never come without the

618
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,279
prescription how to use it because it is

619
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,919
dangerous to use it without one and i

620
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
think therefore it has to have context

621
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,240
and just by chance

622
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
it is here in the rats working group and

623
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
just by chance it is related to eat and

624
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,039
that is how we have said this over and

625
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,760
over again and this is i think the fifth

626
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
time i'm speaking up like this on the

627
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,559
mic so i can just repeat that um and it

628
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,600
has nothing to do with it intrinsically

629
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,880
yeah you see once again it is scoped at

630
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
a station you should the uh the editors

631
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
that they wanted the general purpose uh

632
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,480
method for uh for conveying unsigned

633
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
seaboard claims probably should have

634
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,520
taken this to

635
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
taking this to other to another working

636
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,959
group maybe the ace working group or

637
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,000
i just want to reiterate we've had these

638
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,159
discussions we had the discussion with

639
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,919
with jim shot

640
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,320
let's just move on okay

641
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
and then we can have the discussion

642
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,559
kathleen as chair

643
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,200
posed a question of how we can help eat

644
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
accelerate moving forward which means

645
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,159
tightening its scope so with that let me

646
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
just park it because

647
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,559
we are well over time

648
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,320
and we can come back to it if we have

649
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,559
time at the open mic otherwise we will

650
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,440
raise it again in the mail list

651
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,279
so next gidi uh you are

652
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,720
on for

653
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
at the station for cloud

654
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,679
i think yes so um i thought i'd get

655
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,559
ahead of this issue here uh you know

656
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,000
particularly since we're trying to wrap

657
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,039
up heat

658
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,919
um a white paper came out from the

659
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,279
friday alliance

660
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,679
on on essentially what is cloud

661
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
synchronization of private keys these

662
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
are private keys related to

663
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,600
authentication credentials this is

664
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,640
actually

665
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
uh

666
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
this is actually discussed last summer

667
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
during the apple worldwide developer

668
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,520
conference

669
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,559
um

670
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
there there are valid reasons for this

671
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,840
uh private key synchronization can allow

672
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
for um

673
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,840
for ease of uh user adoption and ease of

674
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,200
end user management credentials

675
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
particularly when

676
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,480
credentials have to move from one device

677
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,600
to another

678
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,840
which could be you know not just device

679
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,520
migration or upgrade it could also be

680
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
lost devices as well what we call device

681
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400
recovery sometimes in the photo context

682
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,840
let's move on to the next slide

683
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
um

684
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,159
so the

685
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,840
uh yeah okay just i knew this drawing

686
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
wouldn't come out very well but i'll

687
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,919
just kind of talk to it fido defines the

688
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,600
authenticator restricted operating

689
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
environment

690
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,480
which ideally would have

691
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,279
a

692
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,360
some sort of uh some sort of trusted

693
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
environment to increase encompass all

694
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
the critical security sensitive

695
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
authenticator operations those would be

696
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,360
for instance by not just uh

697
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,559
sign a

698
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,480
protection of private keys and signing

699
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,120
operations but uh associated signing

700
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,480
operations but also uh biometric match

701
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,279
and

702
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,000
um the attester the attester could very

703
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,279
well uh

704
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,960
be incorporated to the aroe

705
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,039
let's move on to the next slide

706
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
so

707
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
as for the current rats architecture

708
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,840
which

709
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
as was discussed yesterday we really

710
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,880
don't want to

711
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,120
really don't want to change

712
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
uh significantly this point

713
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,400
um

714
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,640
there are some underlying assumptions

715
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,240
that one of them is that the testing

716
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
environment is conventionally isolated

717
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,840
from the target environment

718
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,679
in which you can in which it can collect

719
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
uh evidence about

720
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,799
um the second uh the second part of that

721
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,039
same section goes on to say

722
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
it goes on to discuss that

723
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,520
that

724
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,200
a device that includes the role of the

725
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,039
tester must not be able to modify or

726
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,120
extract keys from the testing

727
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
environments and then unfortunately uh

728
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
unfortunately goes on to mention a fido

729
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
authenticator now

730
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,039
we have a situation where uh

731
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,039
implementers are actively extracting

732
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,960
keys although not necessarily out of

733
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,520
station keys

734
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,000
let's move on

735
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,360
so as i mentioned the phytoauthenticator

736
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
may not have the separation between a

737
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,039
tester and a target in fact photo

738
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,159
authenticators could even be

739
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,120
downloadable applications um

740
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
and we have seen

741
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
uh some implementers actually pursue

742
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,760
that route

743
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
so the question i have to working with

744
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,760
should attestation evidence specifically

745
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,440
address whether

746
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,799
whether private key material is

747
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,320
extractable

748
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
and a sub question would be should this

749
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
evidence be accompanied by evidence that

750
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,000
attestation keys are not extractable

751
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,919
and the lack of such evidence could also

752
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,760
be used by an rt

753
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,440
um

754
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,559
lack of a

755
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,840
lack of explicit evidence that is is

756
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
still a valid data point to any

757
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
appraisal policy

758
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,360
um

759
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,679
so that's the explicit evidence you can

760
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,520
also take the route of what i call

761
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,320
implicit evidence which would be if the

762
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
rp

763
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,600
determines whether the authenticator

764
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,559
allows extrapolates radical keys by some

765
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
other means such as uh such as an

766
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
endorsement

767
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
you know it also carries digital letters

768
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,000
about

769
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,159
letters of assurance dloas that might

770
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,720
actually be sufficient for an rp to make

771
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,120
a termination or a verifier if you want

772
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,640
if you want to keep keep the two

773
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,840
separate

774
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,080
and by the way in fido parlance we don't

775
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
we are we we always assume that the

776
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,760
verifier is integrated in the rp

777
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,000
okay let's move on

778
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,480
next slide

779
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,320
so a couple of

780
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,039
ways forward

781
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
we could define the relevant evidence

782
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,000
entry claims into each document

783
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,279
but that would be assuming that

784
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,279
extractable keys are more general

785
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,000
interest than just authenticators

786
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
we could leave the issue to any profile

787
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,320
for phytocompliant authenticators and

788
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,279
then we can define relevant evidentiary

789
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,039
claims and profile or we could do

790
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,000
nothing

791
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,440
and uh

792
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
let the rp figure out the appraisal

793
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,080
process

794
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
via some sort of implicit evidence or

795
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,919
some other means um

796
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,200
and

797
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
that's it i don't believe i have any

798
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,279
slide on this so

799
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,080
um i just decided to raise this topic

800
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
if i don't see any interest

801
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,960
we won't perceive the first bullet um

802
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
and we we will probably

803
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,919
we probably leave any any potential

804
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,520
solution to the lat latter two

805
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,399
okay

806
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,600
i'm done

807
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,879
hank is coming to the queue

808
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,730
sorry i'm learning this

809
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,399
[Laughter]

810
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:43,840
three days and then still not good at

811
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
this hi this is hank um so

812
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
my first instinct is og snow that was

813
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,240
first instinct like

814
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,000
changing the private key material

815
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
fantastic but then you said

816
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,840
but this comes with an endorsement

817
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
so

818
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,360
if my um i want to say root of trust

819
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,600
okay if my testing environment has this

820
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,399
capability of the key material being

821
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,919
changed

822
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,760
and that's very clear alongside with

823
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,440
every endorsement that the verifier can

824
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
do that

825
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,159
that is fine but how do i guarantee that

826
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,080
there is an endorsement how

827
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,880
do i not guarantee the safe assertion

828
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,960
of my testing environment is hey my keys

829
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
are not

830
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,960
exchangeable and they in fact are

831
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,919
so without a good understanding of the

832
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,240
security considerations how to

833
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
make

834
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,519
endorsements here really really

835
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,519
trustworthy and working

836
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,279
should be is the core of the problem i

837
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,320
think

838
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
it's not actually the problem to change

839
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,640
the key it makes it the problem is that

840
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,279
you must always be aware that this can

841
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,279
happen when you talk to something that

842
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,600
has that capability right so that's my

843
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,559
comment here so not entirely adverse but

844
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,640
it looks like very dangerous terran to

845
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
me

846
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,960
okay

847
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
thanks i i i don't know how to read i

848
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
don't know if you're expecting a

849
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,320
response on that i'll take that as a

850
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
general comment thanks hank

851
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,000
okay dave is in the queue

852
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,760
i agree with your last summary gary i

853
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,159
think right now and i don't claim to

854
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:19,519
fully understand it but right now one of

855
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,720
these three ways forward i'd pick the

856
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,039
second one

857
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,360
okay

858
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
uh oh i think okay i think lawrence is

859
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
getting in the key

860
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
are you in the key oh there there you

861
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,399
are okay

862
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,519
i just think there's a really big

863
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,120
difference between

864
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,240
uh fido authentication keys and

865
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,880
attestation keys so

866
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
export of attestation keys is a really

867
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,559
big deal and it is relevant to this

868
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,640
group phyto authentication keys if

869
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,159
that's all that's being happened with

870
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,640
fido then that's that's a fido thing and

871
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,080
fido should take care of that so that

872
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,559
would probably be a a two or a three on

873
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,960
your list there

874
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
thanks son

875
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,158
okay so giddy if you wanted to

876
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,039
solicit interest

877
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,039
i think it would be good if you can post

878
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,480
it on the mail list

879
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,240
and okay

880
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,039
you know explain the use case and usage

881
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,158
and relevance

882
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,720
and see what what you get

883
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,440
from the mealist response okay

884
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,960
all right thank you

885
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,519
all right thanks

886
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,880
oh sorry

887
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,279
it's okay uh tony natalin

888
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,960
so gary i would

889
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
rather see us do nothing in this

890
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,360
particular space and let fido

891
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,919
or whoever wants to create the profile

892
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
since they're the

893
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,200
you know they're they're the experts in

894
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,039
this particular case

895
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,559
i don't think it makes sense for this

896
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,240
group to do anything with that with that

897
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,840
profile

898
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,640
okay

899
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
thanks tony

900
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,279
all right

901
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,279
thanks anthony sorry i

902
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,039
i missed that on the queue

903
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,000
okay

904
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,480
at that now we will close and uh

905
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,239
we have thomas

906
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,839
hello can you hear me

907
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,320
yes we hear you fine

908
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
good good

909
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,839
cool

910
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,440
okay let's start with the goal of this

911
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,679
document so the scenario

912
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,639
is we have one or more authorized supply

913
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,520
chain actors in the form of oems odms

914
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,599
independent software vendors silicon

915
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,480
providers etc that need to come together

916
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,280
and describe an attester to a verifier

917
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,760
so that when evidence from the attester

918
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,599
is passed on to the verifier the

919
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,239
verifier can use what it learned

920
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
about the tester from the supply chain

921
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
to evaluate the evidence

922
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,839
according to its appraisal policy of

923
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,639
course the idea being that if we have a

924
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,040
standard information and data model then

925
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,560
there's an induced

926
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,800
network effect which is likely to reduce

927
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,000
the fragmentation that is observed today

928
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,920
and this should uh

929
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,400
you know lower the barrier to entry in

930
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
the supply chain actors space which is

931
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,440
currently highly fragmented

932
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,119
and eventually bring us to a better

933
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,680
place um obviously we think this is a

934
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,040
very important work that has not been

935
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,359
tackled in comprehensive way and quorum

936
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,720
is an attempt to deal with this

937
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,599
um

938
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,200
and the new proposed charter tax

939
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
includes scope for this work to be taken

940
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,560
in by the group

941
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,640
but for the time being since we still

942
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,240
live under yield charter the draft

943
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,720
meekly weights at the periphery of of

944
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,359
the working group

945
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,078
so next please

946
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,119
okay so to clarify what is the scope of

947
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,119
concise rims here we are looking at the

948
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
endorsement and reference values arrows

949
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:47,920
that

950
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,480
go into the verifier so we are not

951
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,200
concerned um at all with conveyance of

952
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
appraisal policies here

953
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,000
and besides quorum defines the payloads

954
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
uh not the

955
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,079
the the the underlying transport so um

956
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,920
surely we want this to be compatible

957
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,320
with rest apis which is obviously a very

958
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
natural target for for transporting uh

959
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,960
according payloads and therefore we're

960
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,640
making sure that the right media types

961
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,800
are in place from the onset but apart

962
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,599
from providing this kind of uh glue uh

963
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,359
we're not interested in promoting one

964
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,000
transport or or another uh effectively

965
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,839
quorum is transport agnostic

966
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,000
um yeah i think i'm done with this next

967
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,160
please

968
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,800
okay so um a quick refresher on the

969
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
design principles for those who don't

970
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,839
know or have forgotten

971
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,599
so we described in a tester in terms of

972
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,680
triples which are simple stereotype

973
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,640
sentences with subject verb and object

974
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
which allow us to say things like you

975
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,280
know target environment t as reference

976
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
value x or

977
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,359
a testing environment a as verification

978
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,960
k y

979
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
or targeted testing slash a testing

980
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,680
environment t prime a prime has endorsed

981
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,200
value z

982
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,880
and

983
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
since the set of triple z

984
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,800
is extensible

985
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,880
we can potentially say many more things

986
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,240
for example if you wanted to express

987
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,400
relationships between

988
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,280
sabates or in a composite devices

989
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,760
we could do that by just by minting a

990
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,119
new triple which

991
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,400
provides the the needed semantics

992
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,359
um

993
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,920
this whole thing gets then serialized in

994
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200
sibor

995
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
and i think that's where the concise in

996
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,760
quorum comes from and then we can sign

997
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,359
them with cosi

998
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,440
uh and therefore the triples can become

999
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,079
in fact quadruples by adding the cosy

1000
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,839
signer as the subject of the statement

1001
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,119
that is encoded in the triple

1002
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,560
okay next please

1003
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,599
so status recap where we are

1004
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,280
so the information model has been done

1005
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
in tcg

1006
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,720
specifically in the dice working group

1007
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,119
uh and it's in a document called dice

1008
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,880
endorsement architecture it's quite

1009
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,040
stable i would say in fact it's been

1010
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,160
successfully balloted last week which

1011
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,640
means there is consensus in the working

1012
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,040
group there in tcg to proceed with

1013
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,200
publication um

1014
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
but you know i'm not i'm not a tcg actor

1015
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
in fact i'm a new a newbie there so i'll

1016
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,880
let hank and ned correct me if i'm

1017
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,640
talking rubbish

1018
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,280
but this should be you know roughly

1019
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,839
correct i think

1020
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,760
the data model is

1021
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,640
maintained in github in a github

1022
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,560
repository that is linked in the slide

1023
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,520
and

1024
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,000
and it's what you'd expect basically

1025
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,240
there's a bunch of cdl

1026
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
uh describing the serialization details

1027
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,000
and a number of examples uh in sybor

1028
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,760
diagnostic mutation

1029
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,520
and and and

1030
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,200
with that all the automatic assembly and

1031
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,520
test infrastructure hooked into a bunch

1032
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,240
of uh you know github actions so that we

1033
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,680
we make sure that any change we

1034
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,880
introduce uh is correct

1035
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,280
and uh

1036
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,440
we have also built a fairly complete

1037
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,599
software implementation which tries very

1038
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,359
hard to um

1039
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,560
stay as close

1040
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
to track as close as possible uh the

1041
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,520
bleeding edge in the cdl

1042
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,800
above

1043
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,599
which includes corim comeds which are

1044
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,440
sort of the core building block that's

1045
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,760
where the triples are stored and cost

1046
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
width 2

1047
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,359
and this is all library code

1048
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,720
in golang and

1049
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,640
handy cli build built on top

1050
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,319
of it that is really usable

1051
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
next please

1052
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
so the questions clearly

1053
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,079
we cannot call for adoption now because

1054
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,160
the charter text that contains the scope

1055
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,480
extension that allows core m to be a ras

1056
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,400
work item is not yet in

1057
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,880
so i think the question we can ask the

1058
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,440
group is whether once the new charter is

1059
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,160
in place um

1060
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,040
would core be considered for adoption

1061
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,400
yeah i think that's that's the fair

1062
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
question that you can ask now

1063
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,400
okay so for now you've got dave taylor

1064
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,960
on thecube

1065
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,319
hi dave

1066
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,400
hey taylor hey thomas um so um i think

1067
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
that this is a good document and if the

1068
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,359
charter effort uh goes through then i

1069
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,720
think this would be absolutely

1070
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,440
appropriate to be done in rats so um i

1071
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,599
think this is good work um i think my

1072
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,920
only other comment or question i think

1073
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,560
the value of this is for the um

1074
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,760
if you don't mind can you go back to the

1075
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,920
little diagram that showed the which

1076
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,680
lines and stuff uh you know what i'm

1077
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
talking about uh yeah this one i think

1078
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,160
the primary value for this one is in

1079
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,079
specifying the reference values because

1080
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,599
there's a format for that that doesn't

1081
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,040
cleanly fit into any other document that

1082
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
we have right because you need your

1083
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,960
verbs right you may need to have sets of

1084
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,640
values you know your reference values

1085
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,079
may have

1086
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,240
the the following claim it needs to have

1087
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,920
any of the following values and so it's

1088
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,079
not a singleton it's a set right so that

1089
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,480
that's what i think value of coderem is

1090
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,000
um there's uh with relation to the left

1091
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,440
line though i don't think there's a

1092
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,960
strong case for that although reference

1093
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,319
values could be bundled with

1094
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,000
endorsements and have both lines coming

1095
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,920
from the same body when the two top

1096
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,520
roles are the same entity right when

1097
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
your endorser is also a reference all

1098
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,520
your provider you can do both um but i'm

1099
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
not sure that korean has a strong case

1100
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,960
for endorsements as opposed to one place

1101
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,319
in the document that says reference

1102
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,640
values for evidence and endorsements and

1103
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,160
i completely agree with that right

1104
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,119
because

1105
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,720
your endorsements have claims your

1106
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,760
evidence have claims and they're

1107
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,920
compared to an appraisal policy uh to

1108
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
say to the endorsements and the evidence

1109
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,440
to those claims together match you know

1110
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,800
the following reference values i get

1111
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
that there's a different place in the

1112
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,240
document that says the coloring format

1113
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,160
itself can be used for reference values

1114
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,240
and endorsements and i like the first

1115
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,599
phrase that says these are reference

1116
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,200
values for

1117
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,040
comparing or appraising endorsements and

1118
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,560
evidence rather than saying you'd put

1119
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
evidence themselves in the in the

1120
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,079
co-room format i think if you did that i

1121
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,480
would consider that to be uh reference

1122
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,240
values in the in the current format with

1123
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,680
some additional endorsement stuff showed

1124
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,240
in there too and so i might uh try to

1125
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,280
scope the work to say um keep uh

1126
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,599
endorsements out of it um and just

1127
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:08,800
concentrate on the reference value

1128
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,720
provider line which of course could be

1129
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,079
combined with an entity or whatever i

1130
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,440
think there's a stronger case for that

1131
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,359
so but anyway that i think that the

1132
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,960
document is great so

1133
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,640
okay cool um

1134
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:22,079
on on your question uh on your point um

1135
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,079
where would you put say for example i

1136
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
need to interface with the certification

1137
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:26,720
body

1138
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,599
right so it's not uh you know it's not a

1139
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,119
supply chain um

1140
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,680
supply chain

1141
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,599
this is my personal view if there are

1142
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,599
information needed in the appraisal

1143
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,800
policy

1144
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,760
um

1145
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,400
that cannot be expressed in the same

1146
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,160
sorts of things that eat uses and i

1147
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,079
phrase it that way because it may not be

1148
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,119
the only format if you have a

1149
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,800
proprietary one right but if it's not

1150
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,560
isomorphic to eat then i would put that

1151
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,640
in the reference values line and say

1152
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,319
okay you just have different verbs there

1153
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,079
sure but i would still call that the

1154
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,599
reference values lying to answer your

1155
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,680
question okay it's just how you how how

1156
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,520
you define the lines and so i i'm

1157
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,040
defining the line that way maybe

1158
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,480
differently than how you define the

1159
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,800
lines yeah i think there's a semantic

1160
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,240
mismatch here so okay now the the the uh

1161
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,280
the architecture document is is um it is

1162
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,599
generically phrased enough to uh punt

1163
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,880
this question down the road and i think

1164
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,040
that's perfectly fine right it says

1165
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,880
once we uh recharter then the

1166
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,480
discussions like this start to become in

1167
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,599
scope

1168
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,359
but my main feedback is yes i think it

1169
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,319
would be appropriate for the working

1170
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,680
group to work on this and continue this

1171
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,040
discussion so

1172
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,839
okay thanks very much thanks dave hank

1173
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:36,640
yeah so um to let's start with dave's

1174
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
point first because that's fresh in my

1175
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,760
mind

1176
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
i think endorsements can live without

1177
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,079
reference value provider statements so

1178
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,040
yes

1179
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,560
this could be uh there could be a

1180
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
courier that's just about endorsers

1181
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,240
i think reference values always refer to

1182
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,839
someone who was authoritative to tell

1183
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,960
them and that's

1184
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,119
that's kind of similar to how you would

1185
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,200
describe an endorser

1186
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,640
because the reference where you have to

1187
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,800
come from the authority that creates

1188
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,119
reference about a component of your

1189
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,680
layered device and dice and then yeah

1190
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,520
you have to point to at that at least so

1191
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,119
the identity part of the endorser has to

1192
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,079
go somewhere into reference value uh

1193
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,960
reference integrity measurements because

1194
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,440
otherwise you don't know which testing

1195
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,680
environment is supposed to tell you

1196
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
and evidence about which target

1197
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,599
environment this relationship is very

1198
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,920
important and sometimes it gets a bit

1199
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,480
lost along the lines so i think yes

1200
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,079
endorsements but could stand by

1201
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,200
themselves

1202
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,200
reference values knee pointers to

1203
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,960
endorsers

1204
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,640
so that's a very minimum where this

1205
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,880
overlap happens and i think the co-room

1206
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,560
can be designed maybe there's some

1207
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,560
tweaks here that we can do that we can

1208
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,800
accommodate for the rvp

1209
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,119
and the indoors are being very separate

1210
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,119
and both of them then i can be combined

1211
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,760
by verifier so so i think that that

1212
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,000
might be a a checklist to have to do

1213
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,200
with the cddl so i think uh it's that is

1214
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,880
accomplishable so but thank you for the

1215
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,720
comment i think we have to take into

1216
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,160
account that the red box there green

1217
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
boxes at endorser and rvp's are very

1218
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,760
separate but still the rvp's are about

1219
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,520
things than the adores i will talk about

1220
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,880
so there is some

1221
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,960
relationship there and another thing i

1222
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,560
want to say because thomas is so modest

1223
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,079
about this there's already a

1224
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,839
corresponding uh

1225
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,880
profile of corum which is the psa

1226
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,280
endorsement token so that is going hand

1227
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,880
in hand so we're not just doing this

1228
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,800
like the big bulk but we're doing the

1229
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
application of it of course as a not

1230
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
only proof of concept but an actual line

1231
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,599
of work in parallel thank you

1232
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,960
true thank you hank

1233
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,119
go ahead lauren uh this is lawrence uh

1234
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,960
first i just want you to know that uh

1235
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,400
roman has more books than you

1236
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,640
these are not books they're comic books

1237
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,520
okay all right all right so um

1238
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,079
so the reference values have to

1239
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,280
correlate

1240
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,839
to measurements in evidence otherwise

1241
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,359
you don't know what to do with them

1242
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,160
right

1243
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,119
yep

1244
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:11,839
so

1245
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,680
there's got to be something going on in

1246
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,960
evidence that

1247
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,440
some format you know however the

1248
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,359
measurements are tran transmitted that

1249
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,800
you can correlate them to the right

1250
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,119
reference values now my understanding uh

1251
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,520
uh so there's an implication there for

1252
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,160
eat basically what i'm thinking uh is

1253
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,240
and i but i think this is being handled

1254
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,000
and i wanna i just wanted to surface the

1255
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,880
topic

1256
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,560
um i think it's being handled because

1257
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,800
eat allows uh plug-in

1258
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,319
formats for measurements

1259
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,200
so

1260
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,640
one of the formats for measurement is a

1261
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,640
squid but i don't know what you're doing

1262
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,240
here i think

1263
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,760
i'm a little

1264
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,520
what's that

1265
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,319
yeah you just can so can you use a squid

1266
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,079
with uh with this

1267
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,240
yes yes okay

1268
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,800
okay well that is probably but there's

1269
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,280
also co mid all right i got i'm sorry i

1270
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,440
get my comed and my co-worker

1271
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,480
commit

1272
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,280
co-rem contains comed schema and koswitz

1273
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,560
schema

1274
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,839
okay

1275
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,880
all right got it thank you

1276
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,119
cheers

1277
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,920
okay i think the queue is closed um

1278
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,800
to

1279
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,839
your question thomas you are correct and

1280
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,119
roman also as our a.d mentioned

1281
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,240
as a process reminder we cannot um adopt

1282
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,520
the document

1283
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,040
of course yes you did have dave baylor

1284
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,359
speaking in favor given the scope that

1285
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,119
he described

1286
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,800
the question i'll ask is the chair is um

1287
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
shoot i guess i'll do the poll

1288
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,119
is how many people have actually

1289
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,160
reviewed the draft

1290
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,160
if you can show a hand show

1291
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,279
answer yes to the poll

1292
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:09,200
i keep forgetting we're hybrid um

1293
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,200
have you read

1294
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,960
the korean

1295
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,599
draft

1296
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,119
so what i'd like to see thomas is get

1297
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,720
some feedback

1298
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,960
to make sure that there is interest and

1299
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,599
some have read the draft and agree it i

1300
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,079
mean i'll pick on dave it looks like he

1301
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,920
has read the draft

1302
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,280
um from a processes after we charter we

1303
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,640
we want to get some level of feedback on

1304
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
whether the draft is ready to be adopted

1305
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,839
so

1306
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,559
if i don't have volunteers

1307
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,440
um

1308
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,119
well actually i should say

1309
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:49,119
if we don't have enough people that have

1310
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,119
read the draft

1311
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,559
then um

1312
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,240
i'll ask for volunteers to provide

1313
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,520
feedback

1314
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,599
just to the level and then do the call

1315
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,839
for adoption but this is all after we

1316
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,680
recharter right fantastic that works for

1317
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,040
us

1318
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,880
okay i'm going to give it 10 seconds

1319
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,880
what's that

1320
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,960
okay

1321
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,520
shoot what i should have done is

1322
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,559
asked

1323
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,240
who's read the draft who is not an

1324
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,558
author

1325
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,240
that's why i should have clarified that

1326
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,200
okay

1327
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,260
so so um

1328
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,480
[Music]

1329
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,200
for those who have read the draft um to

1330
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,680
the authors did you do a new revision i

1331
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,640
don't recall

1332
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,040
in

1333
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,079
because we can't be adopted this is not

1334
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,680
very transparent because it's just a

1335
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,119
related document but there's significant

1336
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:00,319
work on this

1337
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,240
for over one and a half years so yes we

1338
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,319
update in regular intervals that are not

1339
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,720
even the cut off

1340
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
so yeah distinction hank

1341
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,800
the authors could be doing significant

1342
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,599
work what i'm trying to assess is

1343
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,599
besides the authors

1344
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,520
in the participants of this working

1345
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
group are there enough besides the

1346
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,359
authors interested

1347
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,680
in this work yeah interested in having

1348
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,160
read it might might be different things

1349
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,319
and also um yeah i'm sorry

1350
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,359
uh this is not this is a fact right so

1351
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,480
and we had uh 15 or 17 votes to being

1352
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,319
interested on the email list

1353
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,640
during christmas already so i would like

1354
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,400
to have them into account if we talk

1355
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,359
about

1356
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,000
uh people interested in having this work

1357
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,079
um yeah they may not be in this room

1358
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,079
here even virtually right now

1359
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,760
i'm just just highlighting there was 17

1360
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,280
15 votes about

1361
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
i'm just saying we're gonna do all that

1362
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,160
again now that we know it's since once

1363
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,119
we know it's in scope okay yeah but that

1364
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,960
you could yeah i could also refer to

1365
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,079
that

1366
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,160
remember i have to refresh the people

1367
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,319
that we have to go through this again

1368
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,680
okay

1369
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,960
okay so with that thank you thomas

1370
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,000
cheers

1371
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,440
thank you

1372
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,720
great so we we are new not too far out

1373
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,960
of our agenda we're only

1374
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
11 minutes late

1375
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,160
but we did leave enough time for open

1376
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,680
mic

1377
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,720
um

1378
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,880
if there are no others

1379
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,359
the chairs actually have a question any

1380
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,680
anything anyone wants to raise

1381
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,880
gidi you're on the cube

1382
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,480
yes i

1383
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,240
want to get back to my presentation i

1384
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,680
want a uh i want to clear uh a clear

1385
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,520
guidance from the group

1386
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,839
on resolving the circular dependency

1387
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,200
between uccs and eat um

1388
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,280
now remember you

1389
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,440
i appreciate hank and carson's comments

1390
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,160
but

1391
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:56,960
you

1392
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,000
eat does share an editor with uccs so i

1393
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,559
don't even believe the uccs editors are

1394
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,559
in consensus uh uh uh uh on on the

1395
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,559
disposition of that document

1396
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,839
so

1397
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,319
i i i'm asking the chairs directly how

1398
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,480
do you want to handle this

1399
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,960
well to be honest with you and i as an

1400
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,920
author of uucs i can't

1401
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,640
discuss that because i'm an author

1402
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,680
but as a chair in general for the eat

1403
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,839
draft one of the questions that we had

1404
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,359
as a chair

1405
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,359
as chairs sorry

1406
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,480
is

1407
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,680
we are concerned about the progress and

1408
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,040
maturity

1409
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
and the question that we wanted to put

1410
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,200
forward to the eat authors

1411
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,559
is your expected timeline if you notice

1412
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,359
the milestones that we updated

1413
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:48,480
we

1414
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,720
noted i think it was in 112 we noted

1415
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,599
using guidance by you as the authors

1416
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,559
that the

1417
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,800
draft should be ready for working group

1418
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,160
last call in april

1419
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,760
my concern is

1420
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,200
that you

1421
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,760
provided two presentations that can grow

1422
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,079
that and stretch that timeline

1423
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,400
no i think the second one actually

1424
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,640
the first one no i don't believe so we

1425
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,720
think we can actually uh we can actually

1426
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,119
resolve that the second one i think the

1427
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,400
the feedback was that we can actually uh

1428
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,440
that uh

1429
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,440
at least the one that i provided was

1430
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,040
that it would be it looks like the

1431
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,400
consensus is that would be better

1432
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,079
handled in a profile

1433
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,400
um i think the attestation results is is

1434
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,800
the annotation results discussion

1435
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,680
doesn't belong in there it doesn't uh it

1436
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,119
would not derail

1437
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,480
the eat document

1438
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,359
um

1439
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,200
and if certain people feel that they are

1440
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,720
i think we should take it to working

1441
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,760
group consensus rather than having uh

1442
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,119
having individuals with their own

1443
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,040
opinions uh in the real progress and

1444
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,920
stuff

1445
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,640
i i do think though this uccs dependency

1446
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,160
needs to be resolved i'm asking the

1447
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,040
chairs once again a recommendation as to

1448
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,359
how they would like to see it resolved

1449
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,559
so

1450
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,880
we had at one point a set of gating

1451
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,680
items for working group last call this

1452
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,559
was this was

1453
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,680
discussed maybe a year ago

1454
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,599
and there was on that list at the time

1455
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,720
there's two or three gating items

1456
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,680
if we go through the list of topics that

1457
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,079
are being discussed there are there are

1458
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:28,079
several more topics that are being

1459
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,480
discussed than those gating item

1460
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,880
topics so the question for from the

1461
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:35,680
chairs is what are the gating items

1462
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,880
exactly

1463
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,119
and how can we you know speak yes

1464
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,280
let's focus on one the circular

1465
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,280
dependency between eat and uccs

1466
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,440
so

1467
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,520
we the editors gave a recommendation it

1468
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,040
sounds like there isn't consensus on

1469
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,559
adopting the recommendation that the

1470
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,000
editors provided

1471
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
so i'm asking it's on asking for an

1472
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,200
alter

1473
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,118
for a uh alternate proposal

1474
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,400
go ahead hank you're in the queue okay

1475
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,359
um two items first of all we can uh give

1476
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,119
a written statement of consensus of the

1477
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,960
editors after we've synced after this

1478
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,960
itf meeting and i'm pretty sure that's

1479
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,160
easy

1480
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,040
uh

1481
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,040
i don't know where is this coming from

1482
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,799
the second item is

1483
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,799
you do not have a circus dependency

1484
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:26,640
dependence of uccs you can just you eat

1485
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,000
just to eat

1486
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,400
and the uccs part can be applied to any

1487
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,559
cwt and we give you even guidance how to

1488
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:33,920
do it with each

1489
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,200
so

1490
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,520
i think you don't have any dependence at

1491
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,599
all just don't mention it

1492
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,440
i think this is a decoupled problem

1493
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,359
that's how it is designed

1494
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,359
that's why we are not holding anything

1495
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,760
up because we made the smart decoupling

1496
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,480
of the problem you can just create each

1497
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,000
specification

1498
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,359
and then say and uccs applies to it

1499
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:57,040
in your ccs

1500
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,359
there's there's no recursive thing

1501
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,839
that's a imaginary problem

1502
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,040
all right

1503
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,000
so

1504
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,240
just to clarify are we saying that we

1505
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,319
rip out all mentioned in utcs in the eat

1506
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,000
document and that can actually uh

1507
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,559
resolve this that's

1508
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,160
if there's working group consensus and

1509
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,400
that is certainly one way forward oh

1510
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,799
yeah go ahead okay uh dave is on the

1511
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,040
queue

1512
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,599
um and i'm gonna repeat a comment that i

1513
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,200
made in chat a while back when the

1514
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,440
during the presentation but i think it's

1515
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,960
consistent with

1516
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,440
um what uh kathleen and nancy had

1517
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,960
commented at the time

1518
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,040
and similar to but not the same as what

1519
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,640
hank just did okay

1520
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,119
my opinion is that uh the best way

1521
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,040
forward would be to

1522
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,599
remove all the normative

1523
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,960
content about uccs out of eat and change

1524
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,799
it to be an informative one and yes i

1525
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,839
know that's work right because that

1526
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,359
would entail moving some stuff that's in

1527
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,440
the eat spec into the uccs doc i see

1528
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,640
lawrence nodding so i'm hoping that

1529
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,160
means yeah you understand what i'm

1530
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,319
saying is i think that that is actually

1531
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,960
uh doable okay and that that is actually

1532
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,440
the fastest path to getting eat rfc okay

1533
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,799
so that's what i would argue as the

1534
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:10,720
alternative is to say take the normative

1535
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,280
content move it into the uccs document

1536
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,680
leave informative content that says you

1537
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,839
know there might be future work on doing

1538
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,000
such and such or you know whatever it is

1539
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,440
that's an informative reference i think

1540
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,720
that's perfectly fine that's the only

1541
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,079
difference between what hank said and i

1542
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,599
said is i would leave it as an

1543
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,960
informative reference because you can

1544
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,119
informatively reference work in progress

1545
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:31,280
right and so uccs would become work in

1546
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,920
progress as far as the uh as an rfc pops

1547
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,119
out is concerned right because it won't

1548
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,960
affect the rfc editor by then right so

1549
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,720
it'll be listed as a net informative

1550
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,240
reference i think that's the way that i

1551
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,599
would go i think that's the fastest past

1552
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,280
rfc so

1553
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,640
okay so let's do this quick lawrence

1554
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,440
so

1555
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,640
uh

1556
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,799
the problem is the cddl

1557
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,440
um that seems that has to be a normative

1558
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,640
reference

1559
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,799
so you can i i mean i know how to make a

1560
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,720
soft preference or or an informative

1561
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,160
reference

1562
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,640
but i need the cddl from for scwt

1563
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,280
in eat to make the cddl and eat complete

1564
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,119
that seems like a hard reference to me

1565
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,720
and that was why we

1566
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,359
proposed bringing that cddl into eat

1567
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:19,040
if if the cdl stays in in uccs then we

1568
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,839
do have a normative

1569
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:24,400
coupling and they have to go together to

1570
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,920
last call or something like that or they

1571
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,680
have to progress together well we we

1572
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,760
have packaged drafts together like we

1573
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,000
did with river tara so

1574
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,040
i don't know

1575
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,880
yeah i don't know what cd that you're

1576
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,160
talking about to be honest are you

1577
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,040
talking about the jc genetics

1578
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,440
because i have no idea what you mean so

1579
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,359
again

1580
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:47,000
it's defined by cwt

1581
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,359
okay that makes more sense now maybe you

1582
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,359
should have elaborated on what you mean

1583
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,319
um

1584
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,839
okay

1585
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:01,760
the cdda for cwt doesn't have to be in

1586
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,880
it

1587
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,160
you just define more claims

1588
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,359
that every other cwtx

1589
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,440
enhancing document has done that exact

1590
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,040
same way i think there's no blocker

1591
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,079
there

1592
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,240
okay guys we

1593
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,480
ned has the chair

1594
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,040
and i'll just echo dave's comment um

1595
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,280
that he says you can keep the ccdl and

1596
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,240
eat and not make the main ccdl depend on

1597
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,040
uccs

1598
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,598
what hank said

1599
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,640
well so before we close ned wants to do

1600
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,119
a poll

1601
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,200
um just so that we can give the eat

1602
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,680
authors guidance

1603
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,720
okay so raise your hand if you if you

1604
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,640
agree to the uh

1605
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,640
motion of moving normative information

1606
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,559
that's currently in the each spec and

1607
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,559
and changing it to be

1608
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:03,559
informative

1609
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,440
so we'll we'll do 10 more seconds be

1610
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,680
quick guys since we're out of time

1611
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,760
what 14 to 15 to 4

1612
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,799
okay so you have to call it okay so uh

1613
01:00:30,799 --> 01:00:32,559
we're just looking at the information

1614
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,400
coming in it looks like there's

1615
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,960
uh consensus around uh moving

1616
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,240
or you know

1617
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,000
migrating the normative

1618
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,119
uh

1619
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,359
too informative that that relates to

1620
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:45,760
uccs in the eat spec

1621
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,240
getty asked for guidance so we asked the

1622
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,879
group for guidance

1623
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,640
okay sorry we're out of time so
