is the

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840

so this will be the main focus of the

173
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,400
working group moving forward

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
um i do want to thank um you know paul

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
and peter for the effort they put into

176
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
that other draft and and they were

177
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
actually the ones who suggested that

178
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
that this one replaced their work so

179
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,759
hopefully this will get some traction

180
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,599
and move through quickly with that uh

181
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,720
dkg you want to say a few things about

182
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,639
your draft

183
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,599
sure

184
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
thanks i'm

185
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,160
this is daniel gilmore

186
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
let me see if i can share my screen with

187
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,160
a handful of slides um

188
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,819
[Music]

189
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
yeah so uh joey salazar can you all see

190
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
the slide that i'm presenting there

191
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
sorry for the um not having uploaded it

192
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,680
earlier

193
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,559
yeah so joey and i uh put this draft

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,919
together uh trying to document um

195
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,640
reasonable policies that can be

196
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
adopted without much coordination

197
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
for the second

198
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
encrypting the second hop of the dns

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,839
traffic

200
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
i know that

201
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,519
as you just said this is supersedes

202
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
other drafts that were in place

203
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
we don't mean this to necessarily

204
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
replace their work but we see it as a

205
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
sort of more of a

206
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
formalization of the kind of work that

207
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
we've been talking about

208
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
and we encourage the folks who have

209
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
worked on the other drafts that this is

210
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
marked officially as superseding to join

211
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,279
us

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,000
in

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,440
contributing to it

214
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,240
um

215
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
so in particular we want to think about

216
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,560
both sides uh what the recursive

217
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,680
resolver and what the authoritative

218
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,440
servers can do without worrying about

219
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,040
any kind of signaling

220
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
we think the best that you can do here

221
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,720
is protection against passive attackers

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,800
and the basic rules are you know

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,399
authoritative servers can listen using

224
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,399
dot or doq

225
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,720
and recursive resolvers can probe by

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,279
authoritative ip address um

227
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,560
for dot and doq and not worry about

228
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,399
authentication failures

229
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
um

230
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,399
so but doing this of course it adds a

231
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,600
few concerns specifically about uh the

232
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,440
additional latency

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
about resource consumption on both the

234
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
recursive recursive resolvers and

235
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,440
authoritative servers and potentially of

236
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
course if this doesn't work that there

237
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,200
will be some data leakage so we try to

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,040
provide specific guidance for what to do

239
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,800
we do not cover probing for doh because

240
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,600
of the path requirement which makes it

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
non-obvious as to how to see whether the

242
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,519
authoritative server offers doh

243
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
and we don't cover how to do signaling

244
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
because again this is unilateral this is

245
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
something that doesn't need a signal to

246
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,720
do you can just try to do it

247
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,600
we do try to outline what kinds of

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
signaling you would need in order to get

249
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
better protection

250
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,720
but that's uh that's relatively small

251
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
part of the draft and we're not

252
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,959
attempting to define any signaling

253
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
mechanisms here or even say how you

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
would use them specifically

255
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,640
um the main changes that we've seen

256
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
thanks to feedback from several people

257
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
on the mailing list and privately

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,600
we've adjusted some of the parameters

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,519
obviously the adoption is is a big

260
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,480
change

261
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
but we've adjusted some of the

262
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,160
parameters in the proposed algorithms to

263
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,440
be better tuned um to

264
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
be to specifically avoid excess resource

265
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,560
consumption

266
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
um and excess latency

267
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
um

268
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
we've tried to clarify

269
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,720
uh the rationales for some of these

270
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,040
choices and in particular dealing with

271
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
how they might interact with pools

272
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
uh we hope that those clarifications are

273
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,600
useful uh but maybe there are some still

274
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,279
i'm sure people who read this and

275
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
attempt the deployment will

276
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
give feedback i hope they'll get

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,480
feedback i'm sure that they'll discover

278
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,399
things that they understand better uh

279
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,680
after deployment than they understood

280
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
just from reading this

281
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
and so i want to encourage folks to try

282
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
implementing this both if you're an

283
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,800
authoritative if you're deploying an

284
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
authoritative server

285
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
um or if you are working on a recursive

286
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,399
um

287
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,640
you know we encourage people to try this

288
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,399
out and give feedback to the draft about

289
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
what gator didn't uh make sense

290
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,040
um there's two sort of open

291
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,720
uh fixed musing the document

292
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
one of them is about

293
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
how the probing policy interacts with

294
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
different connections

295
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
like what should you do

296
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,839
maybe joe you want to jump in and and

297
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
and fill this in for me i'm forgetting

298
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
what the specific fix me is but of

299
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
course folks who can just read the

300
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
document and find fix me

301
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,880
the other one is about how we imagine a

302
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,519
signal to be combined with this

303
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,959
might be nice to provide a little bit of

304
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
text there although of course given that

305
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,920
we don't want to define the signal

306
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,360
itself we can't be too specific

307
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
i think that is

308
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,600
the main thing this is about sort of the

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
history of other work that's gone into

310
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,959
this um

311
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
and again you know our goal here is not

312
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,399
to to

313
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,079
claim that any of these other insights

314
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,680
and these other drafts is wrong but

315
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,320
rather to provide concrete guidance uh

316
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
to implementers and we hope that other

317
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,160
people who've done this kind of work

318
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
will will uh join us on this draft

319
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
um so yeah so we would love to see more

320
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,760
comments and review on the mailing list

321
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,639
um we're doing this uh it's on git lab

322
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
actually not github

323
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
so

324
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,240
happy to have issues and

325
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,519
pull requests or merge requests there

326
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,800
and of course substantive discussion

327
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
does belong on the mailing list as usual

328
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,360
so i think that's all the slides we will

329
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,279
upload a copy of these slides to the

330
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,800
data tracker

331
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
apologies for not getting that to land

332
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,680
in the right spot earlier paul i see

333
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,239
you're in the queue

334
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
hi this is paul hoffman so i'm one of

335
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
the two co-authors on one of the

336
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
previous drafts and

337
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
i want to be super clear

338
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
that peter and i i don't normally speak

339
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
for people but peter's in my other

340
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,959
window here um are fully supportive of

341
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,279
this draft and for people who haven't

342
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,279
been following or got confused because

343
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,519
it took so long to get to this point

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
the main reason that we are very happy

345
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
with this draft and more than ours is

346
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
we could not get traction on ours from

347
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
uh the wide

348
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,320
audience of the working group um that is

349
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
the people who insisted on

350
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,839
strong

351
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,959
signaling would not contribute on weaker

352
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,600
signaling the people who wanted sort of

353
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
mid-level signaling uh

354
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,399
were not

355
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,399
able to contribute on the higher or

356
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,720
lower so by going to and so when when

357
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,680
dkg and joey came up with this draft we

358
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,000
were like oh okay

359
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,839
completely different than where the

360
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,639
working group was bringing us

361
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,440
but

362
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,959
maybe this will get interest and it

363
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
obviously did so we're really happy with

364
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,680
it

365
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,120
um i will contribute um um my

366
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,959
biggest thing that i would say right now

367
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
is i would say that that the working

368
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,399
group would is likely to only finish

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
if we get rid of any signaling at all in

370
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
this current document if we don't even

371
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,800
have whiffs of signaling um

372
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,839
that is

373
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,320
that i i believe that signaling could

374
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,560
come later but only after the folks who

375
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
want the signaling and have figured out

376
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,320
exactly what their requirements are not

377
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
how to do the signaling but what is the

378
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
requirement of it

379
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
which is what ecker uh had gotten at

380
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
initially although he didn't run down

381
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,720
that the road too far on it but with the

382
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,199
the um adot document um was saying we

383
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
need to figure out what you know what

384
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
level of security is needed

385
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,040
i would say for for the current work

386
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,000
rip it all out don't even

387
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
point towards a possible future because

388
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,120
the future could come people could come

389
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
with new document and peter and i are

390
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
not intending to do that

391
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
we mostly went with the signaling

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,440
because that's what the working group

393
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,360
seemed to be asking for

394
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
um i

395
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,399
was personally now because i'm not sure

396
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
that peter agrees but i'm totally happy

397
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,959
with signal free i think that this will

398
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
get us going

399
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,279
and will lay down a good framework for

400
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,160
anybody who feels that they want to add

401
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
signaling to this

402
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,120
um

403
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
so yeah now i'm um we're really happy

404
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,839
that this is happening um i have one

405
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,000
suggestion on keeping the work going

406
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
because we obviously had a problem with

407
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,959
that on our documents uh which is that

408
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,199
um when people propose new issues on the

409
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,320
mailing list that either dkg or joey add

410
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
them to

411
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
uh the get lab um issues list i mean

412
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,880
people can add them on their own but if

413
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
you know since some people really don't

414
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
like doing issues list

415
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,680
um

416
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,120
themselves

417
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,440
that the authors take any issues that

418
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
appear de novo on the mailing list stick

419
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,519
them in git lab and um that way we do

420
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,839
the tracking because what we really you

421
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
know a thing that peter and i that came

422
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,280
to us was we didn't we didn't have any

423
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,319
signal sorry for the pun there of when

424
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,439
issues were closed

425
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
so having them open and close on get get

426
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,599
lab um will really help on um

427
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,640
getting at for the chairs to know when

428
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
we're ready for a working group last

429
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,959
call

430
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,440
um so anyway sorry i'm blathered on

431
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
about a document that i'm no longer

432
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,840
author on but we are really happy with

433
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,400
uh the current document so thank thanks

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,160
to dkg and joey for doing that

435
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,760
thanks paul

436
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
um i just want to say like the draft is

437
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,520
very clear that it's trying is

438
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,679
deliberately not specifying signaling i

439
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,679
mean the name unilateral implies that

440
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,000
there really isn't any signaling to do

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
um

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,320
the

443
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,919
um

444
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
and i wanted to briefly respond martin

445
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,880
sorry just before before you um you step

446
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
up i see you in the queue there

447
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,160
um

448
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,440
ted raises a concern in the chat about

449
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
musts that have that that are like you

450
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,360
must not serve

451
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
uh different records based on the s i

452
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
that's difficult for the client to

453
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,320
understand

454
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,120
um

455
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,919
or or detect right and and

456
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,000
i wanted to explain why those kinds of

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,840
musts are in this draft this kind of

458
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
draft is saying look this is the most

459
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
straightforward way that recursive

460
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,799
resolvers are going to do this kind of

461
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,919
unilateral probing and for this to work

462
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,039
servers need to also do this other thing

463
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,360
right so in some sense the the only

464
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,080
non-unilateral part of this proposal is

465
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
assuming that both sides the recursive

466
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,240
resolvers and the authoritative servers

467
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,400
do adopt you know roughly reasonable um

468
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
implementations there right that that

469
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,160
they adopt implementations that stick to

470
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,960
these standards then it will work if one

471
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
side doesn't cue to the standard then

472
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,760
the defenses against resource exhaustion

473
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
the defenses against

474
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,000
um you know the assuring that records

475
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,400
come back correctly those start to fall

476
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
away so that's the that's the reason why

477
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,240
those kinds of musts are there i agree

478
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,480
it is worrisome that we can't tell but

479
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,080
that's also true in general for dns

480
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,559
requests

481
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
but i don't know if that fully addresses

482
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,000
your squeakiness

483
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
i'm sure parts of it still remain but

484
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,960
just wanted to explain why that's there

485
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
martin you want to go ahead

486
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,840
uh hi martin huneck i would like

487
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
to see in this document

488
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,120
the

489
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
a little bit

490
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,320
higher recommendation to gain over the x

491
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,840
509

492
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,880
uh i would like to see that because of

493
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,480
the this

494
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,160
gain it's possible to do it

495
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,799
automatically on dns

496
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
without

497
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,080
so it might

498
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,160
be uh more

499
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,360
uh

500
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,280
useful to use today over the x 5.9 i

501
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
would see a lot i would like to see

502
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,640
there a

503
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,360
bigger recommendation on that

504
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,320
so

505
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
let me make sure that i understand

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,440
martin what you're asking for i think

507
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
what you're saying is you'd like to see

508
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,919
dane authentication of the authoritative

509
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,760
server by name

510
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
for the tls channel itself

511
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,520
uh yeah i would like to see

512
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,480
this over the x509

513
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,799
i see so i'm not convinced that that

514
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
belongs in this draft because this draft

515
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,600
basically the the unilateral part of it

516
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,280
basically means that it's going to be

517
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,880
opportunistic

518
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
and so to the extent that this draft

519
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,360
talks about authenticating the

520
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
authoritative server at all

521
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,679
um it basically says you can try to

522
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,440
authenticate if you like but whatever

523
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
you do don't

524
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
don't ignore like don't uh block the

525
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,640
connection on the basis of

526
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,799
authentication yeah i understand that

527
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,320
but uh there's also some for the smaller

528
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,400
uh i don't know how it's actually

529
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,480
written there uh

530
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
that some smaller uh

531
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,640
dns servers might use a self-sign it

532
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,559
so uh maybe

533
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,600
also recommend there that

534
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,480
they

535
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,559
could be a better alternative to it

536
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,039
um i think that would belong in a draft

537
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,320
that that uh is not opportunistic right

538
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,480
in a draft that says

539
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
you know that tries to to lock in the

540
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
security guarantees

541
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,799
including against active attackers that

542
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,400
would be appropriate and i would support

543
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,320
it but given that this draft doesn't

544
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,799
lock in i'm reluctant to have it weighed

545
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
into you know here's a recommendation

546
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,720
you should do this kind of thing because

547
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,559
this draft doesn't even say like what

548
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,480
name should the client expect

549
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,320
right we're leaving that deliberately

550
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
this draft is deliberately agnostic

551
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
about that because we want to say look

552
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
here is the way to get defense against

553
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
uh passive monitors right you could you

554
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,080
can do this thing and you don't have to

555
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,919
worry about any of the rest of it and a

556
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,760
recommendation throwing a recommendation

557
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
in here about how to authenticate

558
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,919
means that we're sort of opening the

559
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,440
door to discussions that this draft

560
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,200
isn't willing to contemplate i should be

561
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
clear i

562
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,159
i am with you in the bigger picture but

563
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,400
i want to keep this draft simple so that

564
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
people can implement it we can get some

565
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,039
experience and we can see what

566
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,880
percentage we can get protect against

567
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
passive attackers just doing the simple

568
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,600
thing

569
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,039
um and i think that will motivate the

570
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,320
kinds of recommendations that you're

571
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,720
asking for in other drafts

572
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
okay thank you very much

573
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,400
thank you martin

574
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,880
then i see you up in the queue

575
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,000
hey uh just to emphasize dkg's point um

576
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,320
i don't think there's any conflict here

577
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,840
if anything these these fit together

578
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
nicely self-signed certificates are

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,240
entirely compatible with dane

580
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,760
yeah in in dany e-mode you can just drop

581
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,080
the hash of that self-signed certificate

582
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
into your dane record

583
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
and uh now you have dane authentication

584
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,120
so

585
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
i think the draft is saying here's

586
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,480
here's a simple thing that you can start

587
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,000
with and that will set us up for uh for

588
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,559
future authenticated modes that are

589
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,120
trickier to standardize

590
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,520
thanks ben eric i see you there

591
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,120
yeah i mean

592
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,000
maybe

593
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,080
um i feel like there are two

594
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
uh

595
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
perhaps you know

596
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,159
three different framings of this

597
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,120
document

598
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
one document one framing of the previous

599
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,919
emails ago pkg um namely that it's the

600
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,039
um

601
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,120
you know uh uh

602
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
it's about seeing how much deployment

603
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
you can get um you know with for passive

604
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,720
attack right um

605
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
uh another framing is that it's about

606
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,080
getting experienced with um you know the

607
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,720
operational uh pressures of having

608
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
increased the dns um to authoritative

609
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
and the third is that it's a bridge

610
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,120
to um uh to to a mode that is stronger

611
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
right

612
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
and

613
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
um the ascent to which uh it's i guess

614
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
one and two

615
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,799
then yeah it doesn't matter all what

616
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,600
what what the server is serving but um

617
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
but to send to which it says it was a

618
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,720
bridge then um then certainly something

619
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,480
which you know be bogus um uh is is it

620
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
for is unfortunate because it's a new

621
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,400
hurdle for for for any any future

622
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
scenario mechanism so i mean to be like

623
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
it's like as a sort of like not done

624
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,799
fishing is the right way to do it but as

625
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,600
um you know for for example if you serve

626
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,600
a valid certificate um

627
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
via whatever mechanism um then it's

628
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,799
possible to have um some sort of hsts

629
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,320
type that kind of uh

630
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,400
you know signal in the uh um

631
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,480
in the dns but if you're serving your

632
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
presumptively invalid certificate and

633
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
yeah and they're then um then it would

634
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,919
be unfortunate um and perhaps i think um

635
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,760
extraordinarily undesirable to have an

636
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,679
hts mechanism served over like an

637
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,039
unvalidated self-certificate because

638
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,559
then you have to worry about um you know

639
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,640
about uh temporary attacks being boosted

640
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,720
up into long-term attacks so

641
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,640
i i guess i i think i'm less sanguine

642
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,400
with the idea of encouraging people to

643
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
serve um like not even in principle

644
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,840
validatable um

645
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,279
credentials

646
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,600
so uh eric i

647
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
uh let me first say that the three

648
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
different ways that you describe of

649
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,320
reading the draft i think are all valid

650
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,000
those are all things that i envision

651
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,679
this draft as doing

652
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,080
and i hear your concern about uh

653
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,559
encouraging things that would

654
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,720
that would make things worse for future

655
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,559
signaling but here's the way that i'm

656
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
thinking about it this draft i think

657
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,640
doesn't need to specify any particular

658
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
recommendation

659
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
because

660
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,600
to the extent that we do want to have

661
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,039
signaling

662
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
hsts style or whatever other kind of

663
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
style

664
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,960
the point for that signaling is to

665
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
upgrade from whatever this mechanism is

666
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
and if that signaling description

667
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,960
says

668
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,520
by the way now you need to make sure

669
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,880
you know when you're doing the signaling

670
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
you need to ensure that you are offering

671
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,919
the following kind of certificate or

672
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:57,039
following kind of authentication

673
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,400
mechanisms

674
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
that's part of how you turn signaling on

675
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
right and yes i agree with you any hscs

676
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
style mechanism should not

677
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
work over a presumptively invalid

678
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,159
certificate therefore if that signaling

679
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,840
mechanism that we choose you simply

680
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
haven't achieved that if you haven't

681
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
given a

682
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,240
validate certificate we i think we can

683
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
defer that authentication question to

684
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
whatever signaling draft we put in place

685
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,799
after this i'm hoping that we will get

686
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
to that point does that make sense

687
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,279
uh

688
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,799
i think it makes sense i'm not sure i'm

689
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,480
not sure i agree strategically but i'm

690
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,000
not sure but i think getting something

691
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,840
better than nothing so

692
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,559
i'll

693
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,000
i'll be quiet for now

694
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,440
okay i'm happy to talk with you more

695
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,520
later if you want to strategize about um

696
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,520
this kind of problems i i care about

697
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
that too yeah i think all i'm trying to

698
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,960
say is like i don't want to get into a

699
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,679
bad equilibrium where like where like

700
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,000
everybody has self sign search with it

701
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
we have no way to boost strap up and

702
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,120
then that and and then and then the um

703
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,159
and and then

704
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:56,880
and

705
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,039
the two open questions really are

706
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,640
about any kind of mechanism like this

707
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,799
one whether or not like the sort of

708
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,039
operational aspects of running the um

709
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,360
you know of like like having all your

710
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,000
formerly 53 traffic turned on to like

711
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,320
dot or doke like our pro probabilities

712
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,279
and i've heard a bunch of complaints

713
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,279
about that and the second is like where

714
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,640
the operational aspects like of having

715
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,399
like actually serving a valid credential

716
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,640
right and so my fear is that we get this

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
equilibrium where people if i feel

718
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
comfortable surfing like tls in general

719
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,440
but then they're like well it's too it's

720
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,640
like actually having like a valid

721
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
credentials prohibited evidence and so i

722
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,600
would and so like we until then we can't

723
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,760
please drop off so that's so

724
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,120
how we get there i don't know that's my

725
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,600
concern the main gotcha that i hear in

726
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,840
the scenario that you describe is where

727
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
it is not possible to change the

728
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,279
authentication credential

729
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,559
um

730
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,240
right where somehow people feel like

731
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,840
they've they've gotten used to serving

732
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
it in this unilateral way

733
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,039
um with

734
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,039
whatever weak authentication is and then

735
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,120
they decide they want to go more secure

736
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
and they find that they are trapped

737
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
because they if they try to change the

738
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
credential that they offer they run the

739
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,000
risk of

740
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
dosing themselves

741
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,480
right

742
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
uh no i don't think that's not quite

743
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
what i mean i mean maybe but i think i

744
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
guess i guess what i'm saying is like i

745
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
think the history of like deployment on

746
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,480
the web there was like a lot of talk for

747
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,880
a whole long time about how we how he or

748
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,600
she saw certificates right and um and

749
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
there's a feeling that it was too hard

750
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,679
to get um you know web pretty high valid

751
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,600
credentials and

752
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,120
that

753
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,640
it turned out to be the case obviously

754
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,440
uh after after like some work but i

755
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,520
guess i'm i'm just just frantically

756
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,360
concerned about having people feel like

757
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,880
they've done all the work and then

758
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
having a new barrier to have to climb

759
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
and i'm going to climb that barrier but

760
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
again again i think like you're you're

761
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
raising a valid diploma theory i'm not

762
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
sure i share it but like i'm happy if

763
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
people are enthusiastic about this one i

764
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,200
think like let's go with it

765
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,399
yeah okay

766
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,000
um

767
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
yeah i think this is one step and we're

768
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,440
looking to climb a bunch of steps

769
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,440
eventually and i think helping people

770
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
climb the one step first and then yes

771
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,880
have another step to take i think that's

772
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,559
the right way to go but we'll see what

773
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,520
happens

774
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,399
paul you're next

775
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,080
so thank you to eric for the uh um

776
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,399
the three purposes

777
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,399
um i would very much like to say that um

778
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,640
i don't i think that the third purpose

779
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,480
this is you know that this draft is

780
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
going to act as a bridge to the future

781
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,880
one should be completely out of scope

782
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,760
and not done there should be and and you

783
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
know because eric brought this up a few

784
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,679
months ago and i thought it was a really

785
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,000
good discussion on the list there should

786
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
be nothing in this draft or or in the

787
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
draft that we adopt you know that that

788
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
gets out of the working group there

789
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,760
should be nothing in that document that

790
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,120
prevents

791
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,279
any sane

792
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,919
fully authenticated system from being

793
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,679
deployed so absolutely no prevention but

794
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,080
there should not be any feeling that

795
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,120
this is a bridge towards one or many of

796
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,760
them because it will turn into a bridge

797
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
towards one but not the others and such

798
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,080
and so that goes exactly to what eric

799
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,600
was saying with the oh you know well if

800
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,080
people already have self-signed certs

801
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,960
then you know this this they may feel

802
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
like they don't want to go up to the

803
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
next level

804
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,200
that desire to go up to the next level

805
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,080
is

806
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,200
what needs to be motivating for the uh

807
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
you know whatever the document is so i

808
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,600
would really like to see us not try to

809
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,279
bridge but very actively try not to

810
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,360
um to block and the exact point here is

811
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
you know ecker was saying um well you

812
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,279
know if people just have self-signed

813
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,159
certs

814
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,919
you know that's not good we should try

815
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,159
to get them to have real certs

816
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,720
but we don't know what the name is we i

817
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,559
mean we've had discussions on the list

818
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,919
of what name do you put in a cert for

819
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,399
a server that has a hundred thousand

820
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,799
names or what name do you put in the

821
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,919
cert

822
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,679
should it be an ip address or things

823
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
like that until we have that discussion

824
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,760
i believe the world is better off with

825
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,720
people putting in obviously self-signed

826
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,760
certs with crappy identities in them

827
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,799
that would that will shine a light on

828
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,440
this is not meant for that next thing

829
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,559
over there

830
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,880
so i'm happy with it but i would love to

831
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,679
see um eckers uh trilogy or at least the

832
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,399
first two parts of vector's trilogy uh

833
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,760
clearly reflected um up front in in the

834
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,640
document of these are the design goals

835
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,960
um and it might be okay to say as a

836
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
design goal we don't want to get in the

837
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,720
way of future things um

838
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,559
that's sort of a topology because you

839
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,840
never want to get in the way of future

840
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
things but it might be worth you know at

841
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,960
least uh

842
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,320
bowing in that direction

843
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,480
thank you paul

844
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,559
it looks like the queue is drained to me

845
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,640
i don't want to steal more time from the

846
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,440
working group than we need um

847
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
so

848
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,840
i think i'm going to step away from the

849
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,519
mic and stop sharing

850
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,640
thank you for the discussion and i look

851
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,519
forward to more comments

852
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,799
yeah

853
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,440
thank you

854
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,840
yep that's the right one alex thanks

855
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,840
um so the last topic on the on the

856
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,480
agenda and and this is kind of more to

857
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,880
spoiler discussion on the mailing list

858
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,039
but um

859
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,880
you know with with with the adoption of

860
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,480
unilateral probing

861
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,919
you know what we're really looking at

862
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,559
here is is the last milestone that the

863
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
working group has identified

864
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
uh alex i think there's one more slide

865
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,440
if you could jump to that

866
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,799
yeah

867
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,600
so

868
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
so we've completed the work on on the

869
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
confidentiality between stubbs and

870
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,279
revolvers and

871
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,799
you know we've been talking about doing

872
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,320
both on unauthenticated and

873
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,679
authenticated

874
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,919
uh work or connections between the

875
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,480
recursive and the authoritative servers

876
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,399
it seems that at this point where we're

877
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,960
really kind of focused on on more of the

878
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,480
the unauthenticated

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,039
uh as the time being and and waiting on

880
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,080
on what to do for the authenticated side

881
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,240
um so

882
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,200
the the key thing here is is is to

883
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
really kind of focus the working group

884
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,080
on on getting this this document you

885
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,240
know you know you know get it quality

886
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,360
reviews

887
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,360
get iterations encourage some

888
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,200
implementation so that we can we can

889
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,080
understand what's going on with the um

890
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,440
with the functions defined in the

891
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,519
document

892
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,720
um

893
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,080
so

894
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,600
and that one more slide alex

895
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,480
so with the existing milestones

896
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,960
we originally had a a milestone for

897
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,719
developing the requirements

898
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,199
we we tried that um the working group

899
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,960
didn't seem to be all that interested in

900
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,839
it um so it's been marked as abandoned

901
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:18,839
the

902
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,000
um the work the milestone focusing on

903
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,199
the the solution for adding

904
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
confidentiality to exchanges with the

905
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,280
authoritative servers

906
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,719
we think that the unilateral probing

907
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,719
drafts is going to provide

908
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,918
that

909
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
functionality and so we really want to

910
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,440
focus there

911
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,679
and then at one point we had a milestone

912
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
that talked about defining and

913
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,280
collecting and publishing performance

914
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,119
data for measuring the effectiveness of

915
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,599
deprived published technologies

916
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,040
um

917
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
tim and i had the discussion about this

918
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
and we were

919
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,800
struggling to figure out you know who in

920
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,719
the working group would be

921
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,040
um you know really interested in doing

922
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,520
those kinds of measurements uh and being

923
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,359
able to structure it in a way that gave

924
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,920
us useful data

925
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
and we really didn't come up with a

926
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,920
great answer so

927
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,599
we're actually suggesting that that

928
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,440
perhaps tim and i go and talk to the to

929
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,520
the map rg chairs because this seems to

930
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,680
be far more in their their bailiwick of

931
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,960
expertise

932
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,040
in in doing these these types of

933
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
measurements

934
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,480
the one thing i will say here is is that

935
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,880
you know because we were talking about

936
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,560
the performance against pervasive

937
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,320
monitoring we would just probably want

938
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,240
to you know get that point across that

939
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,000
it's not just measuring you know traffic

940
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
to and from servers it's really

941
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,040
measuring more of the

942
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,280
the capabilities to um

943
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
you know prevent that kind of pervasive

944
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
monitoring

945
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,280
so

946
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,359
what this really means is is you know

947
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,720
right now tim and i see the working

948
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,040
group as being tightly focused on on

949
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,280
getting unilateral probing you know move

950
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,800
through the process

951
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,960
and and out the door so that we can we

952
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,720
can start seeing some

953
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,920
deployments and some some

954
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
experimentation so if anybody has

955
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,160
comments on that and we have a couple

956
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,240
minutes left

957
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,800
otherwise we'll we'll probably focus on

958
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,079
moving the discussion to the mailing

959
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,440
list

960
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,440
paul

961
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
uh paul hoffman so one minor comment is

962
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
on number two

963
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
i know that our charter says

964
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
experimental

965
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,839
um i didn't agree with it at the time i

966
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:25,680
don't agree with it now

967
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320
the current draft

968
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
is definitely protocol like i don't

969
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,879
think of it as an experiment

970
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,040
we've heard that there is interest both

971
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,000
on resolver side and on authoritative

972
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
server side of doing it once we it's

973
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,680
moving forward um i don't think we need

974
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,880
to change the charter at this point um

975
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,960
but as as

976
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,440
unilateral probing goes into

977
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,760
uh towards working group last call it um

978
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
it's currently marked as informational

979
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,720
which is is particularly uh um

980
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,960
inappropriate um i would like to see

981
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,359
this just beyond standards track i

982
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,359
there will be as there will be more

983
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,760
implementation of this than many other

984
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,400
working groups have for some of their

985
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
standards track documents i don't see

986
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,880
any any reason to call this experimental

987
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,680
um

988
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
as long as

989
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,040
still at that time there are a couple

990
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
resolvers and a couple of authoritative

991
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,359
servers and a couple of operators who

992
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,680
are doing it

993
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,839
yeah so experimental actually came from

994
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,960
the original

995
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,720
form and a formulation of the of the

996
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
charter and and so

997
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,040
i kind of see that as the the minimal

998
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,920
bar

999
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
uh if if the working group thinks that

1000
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,680
it is standard track um that's not going

1001
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,320
to force us into a recharter or forcing

1002
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,839
it to be experimental it will it will be

1003
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,119
what the working group thinks it should

1004
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,839
be

1005
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,480
alex

1006
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,240
thank you alex mayor

1007
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
um i want to make a comment on the third

1008
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
point on collecting performance data and

1009
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
effectiveness of the technologies um i

1010
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,720
think that

1011
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,359
that is a nice uh that could be a nice

1012
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,400
outcome of of the map rg working group

1013
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
and i want to remind people that we

1014
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,440
still have an experimental rfc

1015
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,400
um about the padding policy

1016
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
uh you remember that dkg back then did

1017
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
like a single

1018
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,240
measurement study about what the

1019
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,040
appropriate betting size would be

1020
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,400
and i converted it in a document and

1021
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,280
um

1022
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,640
that outcome of number three could

1023
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
actually be good inputs to like a

1024
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,240
revision of that document with updated

1025
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,880
security properties of the padding sizes

1026
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
and my question is then where would you

1027
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,200
do that

1028
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
then as soon as we have the results from

1029
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,680
aprg

1030
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,839
and the other thing

1031
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,480
is if we ever do

1032
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,359
authenticated

1033
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
resolver to recursive

1034
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,079
where do we stuff that work

1035
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,400
so if that that would actually be in

1036
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,480
deprived it's like right now we don't

1037
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,320
have a proposal

1038
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,160
in the working group so you know what

1039
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,359
what tim and i would like to do is

1040
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,920
really focus on on getting a

1041
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,560
unilateral probing draft done

1042
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,880
um if you could could you actually

1043
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
uh post a link to that draft you

1044
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,640
mentioned for the measurements to the

1045
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,560
mailing list that may spur some

1046
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,320
conversations and maybe encourage

1047
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
thanks and um

1048
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
and if there are people interested in

1049
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,040
doing those measurements from

1050
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,800
participating then you know we can

1051
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,400
revisit that but i think the the big

1052
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,000
thing is that we haven't seen anybody

1053
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,440
really standing up and saying they're

1054
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,599
interested in doing that kind of

1055
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,960
measurements

1056
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
but that those are both good points alex

1057
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,680
thanks

1058
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,240
uh eric

1059
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,480
yeah thanks um uh we we can debate this

1060
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
later but i just want to register that i

1061
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,440
would not be in favor of taking a lot of

1062
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
appropriate to put it i think it's a

1063
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
good idea because i mean you approach

1064
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,480
that

1065
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
okay yeah it's like i said it it's a

1066
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
discussion for the working group and in

1067
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,680
conjunction with our ad to see what what

1068
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,960
makes the most sense for the status

1069
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,680
all right any other comments before we

1070
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,078
wrap up

1071
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,800
all right hearing nothing um

1072
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,960
i want to thank everyone for attending

1073
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,839
both uh in person and virtual i hope

1074
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,440
everyone was able to get

1075
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,359
youthful information out of it

1076
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,760
uh i also want to thank benno and alex

1077
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,640
for

1078
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,280
for being our our hands on on site

1079
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
and um hopefully we will

1080
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
maybe actually have like a real

1081
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
in-person meeting the next time around

1082
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,640
um

1083
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,960
and with that i'm going to wrap up and

1084
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
and say thanks for attending deprived

1085
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,480
and stand by for the add meeting

1086
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,880
thanks all

1087
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,560
hey whoever got controlled can you

1088
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,440
transfer over me please

1089
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
that is one

1090
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,440
uh you probably would need to share the

1091
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,760
slides then yourself because

1092
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,640
i'm not a delegate

1093
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,800
can you transfer the control

1094
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,119
client

1095
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,920
excellent thank you

1096
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,480
there you go

1097
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,560
well there's

1098
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,480
a new version of how to get that

1099
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,480
uploaded

1100
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,119
confusing chair slides are uh

1101
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,839
maybe very similar

1102
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,959
for seeing that

1103
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,720
how do i get the um the slides that are

1104
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,839
being shown to refresh

1105
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,640
i can throw them away

1106
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,280
the chair slide should have six six a

1107
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,119
six slide but the one that are currently

1108
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,119
active only have five

1109
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,079
so i refreshed

1110
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,440
the documents so and uploaded the 80d

1111
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,720
chair slides can you reopen them

1112
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,560
let me try that i i did the refresh too

1113
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,640
i didn't seem to affect the slides that

1114
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,400
were in the system but let me try again

1115
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,520
oh i see we've done it thank you sir

1116
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,839
this one yeah exactly thanks

1117
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,920
okay for those who are waiting for add

1118
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,400
we will start at uh

1119
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,319
15 minutes past the hour so you have a

1120
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:05,760
couple minutes

1121
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,800
to grab a coffee or whatever you need to

1122
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720
get you through

1123
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,439
the next session

1124
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,880
and i promise the folks that are that

1125
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,200
are remote in california that we won't

1126
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,480
start before

1127
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,040
15 minutes past the hour so they didn't

1128
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,079
have to get up too early

1129
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,880
the sun's just coming up here

1130
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,839
uh

1131
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,160
this

1132
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,119
okay at least tommy we were originally

1133
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,520
scheduled at um

1134
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,480
at uh i think 2 a.m california time so

1135
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,960
this is the better slot we we we we did

1136
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,200
good

1137
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,119
now here's 2am on friday

1138
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,599
but that's why my working group got

1139
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,160
scheduled at 2 a.m on friday

1140
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,480
whoa i'm sorry oh that's terrible

anything

1142
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,400
and uh if anybody from deepwood is still

1143
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,400
on here i see that we got a set of

1144
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,160
slides proposed by uh dan gilmore

1145
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,119
um for unilateral probing that need

1146
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,160
approval

1147
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,240

1181
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,599
me and glenn so i don't think any

1182
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,839
further introductions are needed

1183
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,119
well there's one eric link our area

1184

who's awesome

1186
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,280
um so first order of business um we have

1187
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,839
three giraffes currently that have been

1188
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,400
out there in working group last call

1189
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,680
um

1190
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,520
these are the three of them listed let

1191
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,800
me start at the bottom um the dns

1192
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,200
binding mapping for dns server service

1193
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,680
funny mapping for dns service online cut

1194
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,119
number three of coffee today so i'm

1195
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,720
still waking up

1196
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,440
um that one has not really received any

1197
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,680
uh negative comments or any any changes

1198
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,520
requested uh on the list so uh i think

1199
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,240
we can go ahead and call that one as a

1200
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,240
passing working group last call

1201
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,559
that brings us to the other two drafts

1202
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,640
um there have been a lot of comments

1203
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,400
flying around around dnr um

1204
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
from both ben and uh chris especially

1205
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,119
uh and i see today some discussion on

1206
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,760
lists about some sort of changes or

1207
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,119
small editorial uh commentable priority

1208
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,920
uh flowing over into ddr

1209
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,800
so i'm wondering do the the various

1210
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,480
editors for those documents want to make

1211
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,160
any comments about where where they

1212
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,839
think we're at with

1213
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,599
regard to some tommy i see you're in the

1214
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,839
queue

1215
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,599
yes thank you um so we we do

1216
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,440
have uh two open issues on ddr

1217
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,520
they are both

1218
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,280
what i would consider to be you know

1219
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,520
pretty editorial but you know

1220
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,720
they don't change the protocol

1221
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,240
fundamentally one is about uh explaining

1222
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,480
kind of nx domain behavior

1223
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,960
around resolver.arpa and the other one

1224
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,960
is what was discussed on list

1225
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,880
today about hey we should give a call

1226
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,480
out to dnr so

1227
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,079
i i think that's all the feedback we

1228
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,440
have um

1229
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,280
based on that

1230
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,800
you know i i

1231
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
i would say that the next state for this

1232
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,760
should be

1233
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,720
kind of like

1234
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
last call closed but we need another

1235
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,480
revision right so we'll come up with

1236
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,000
another revision and then it could go on

1237
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,400
to kind of the shepherd write-up

1238
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,640
uh from there but

1239
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,720
any problems getting that next copy out

1240
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,079
in the next week or so

1241
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,559
okay thank you bobby that that's sort of

1242
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,800
my feeling too um mr lawrence do you

1243
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,559
have any different opinion on this one

1244
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
we're all on the same page

1245
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,839
okay uh so then that brings us to dnr

1246
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:26,880
um uh our

1247
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,240
our chris uh box around with the queue

1248
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,839
want to make any comment

1249
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:34,400
tyro i see you're in the queue as well

1250
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,839
potentially do you want to make some

1251
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,200
comments about where you guys think

1252
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,800
we're at with this draft and the various

1253
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,520
changes that have been proposed

1254
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,240
yeah

1255
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,119
we just posted uh the changes uh today

1256
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,800
and i see that we have addressed all the

1257
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,720
comments from chris except the one that

1258
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,880
ben had rise which is with regard to ndp

1259
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
and we have posted and questioned back

1260
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,280
to the six-man working group i have not

1261
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,760
seen any response i see ben added his

1262
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,280
clarification regarding rfc 4861 uh i

1263
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,040
think only after that feedback we will

1264
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,280
be able to update this option so we have

1265
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,119
an external dependency and if we don't

1266
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,280
get a response maybe the js can

1267
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,520
intervene and help us get some experts

1268
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,280
in a six-man working group to respond

1269
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,920
what is the right way of whether we need

1270
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,480
an implicit uh service priority or an ex

1271
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,640
service priority so i think that's the

1272
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,960
one that needs uh some more discussion

1273
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,839
and we need uh some clarity from uh the

1274
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,839
other working group uh the other one i

1275
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,079
see uh just now ben had posted saying

1276
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,720
it's not alias mode but rather a mode in

1277
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,160
which only the

1278
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,319
adn is published restaurant feeds or

1279
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,839
will be ignored so

1280
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,599
i think we'll have to think about it and

1281
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,839
get back to him so i think this is only

1282
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:43,680
two pending comments that i really need

1283
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,359
to be addressed

1284
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,240
okay

1285
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,319
and i see chris boxes in queue chris

1286
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:51,760
hello um

1287
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,319
so yeah the week there has been a flurry

1288
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,880
of activity on the list so most of those

1289
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,920
have been

1290
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,280
um

1291
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,200
accepted i think so

1292
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,960
there are a couple of areas where um i'd

1293
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
like to hear from other people in the

1294
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,920
working group if they've got opinions on

1295
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,800
it

1296
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,760
um

1297
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,680
i'm not sure so if we don't hear any

1298
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,319
then you know maybe the next step is

1299
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,559
issue a revision and then people can

1300
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,520
talk about that

1301
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,839
okay

1302
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,520
so then i guess to summarize that

1303
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,079
and i i realized also that i forgot to

1304
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,559
call for a a scribe for our notes

1305
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,200
so uh we'll get to that in a second but

1306
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,480
to summarize the conversation i'll

1307
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,240
capture these in the notes

1308
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,839
so number three is is past working group

1309
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,319
on number one we're pretty much ready

1310
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,400
there's just uh the two edits that are

1311
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,240
going to go in and then it's ready for

1312
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,319
passing on to a

1313
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,079
um

1314
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:54,000
the the the shepherd

1315
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
and then on number two we've got a few

1316
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,599
outstanding issues with six man and

1317
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,079
stuff like that uh and and and what not

1318
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,359
to resolve but it looks like we're in

1319
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,280
pretty good shape to have that closed

1320
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,720
off fairly soon

1321
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,240
is that an accurate reading does anybody

1322
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,558
have an issue with us for a summary

1323
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,760
okay

1324
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,119
now with that can we have somebody

1325
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,920
volunteer to take notes

1326
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,160
alex thank you alex

1327
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,160
just quickly take a note of the last

1328
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,800
conversation and then um

1329
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,079
so

1330
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,880
moving on

1331
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,319
let's go to the agenda

1332
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,839
um uh should i should i add that to the

1333
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,119
80d nodes or to the deprived nodes

1334
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,119
uh they're actually one the same if you

1335
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,720
go down down farther in the the uh

1336
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,880
ad notes you'll see it where is the

1337
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,440
agenda see the chair slides where's the

1338
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,359
agenda

1339
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,720
does it not pull up the agenda

1340
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,640
i got it i'm gonna add it to the deep

1341
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,200
private uh notes

1342
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,720
because i think that the other one is

1343
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,399
canceled and so oh i got it

1344
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,440
alex you have to be a bit closer to the

1345
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,000
mic when you're talking

1346
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,720
i'm all set for note taking so go ahead

1347
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,240
hello i'm back

1348

1350
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,599
for note-taking so you can go ahead i

1351
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,760
didn't know

1352
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,799
i'm looking for

1353
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:55,180
do the

1354
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,520
[Music]

1355
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,440
the agenda deck does not get outback be

1356
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,440
loaded

1357
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,119
the the the markdown agenda is i don't

1358
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,240
see that in the list of decks to share

1359
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,440
here i can share it off my screen

1360
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,880
directly there okay

1361
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,760
like i share split horizon

1362
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:18,880
so

1363
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,079
um

1364
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,960
yeah okay so let's do this um so the

1365
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,839
very first one will be uh tiru

1366
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,640
europe for split horizon dns

1367
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,520
um

1368
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,520
do you want me to show the slides or do

1369
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,640
you want to drive

1370
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,720
lights

1371
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,520
say game

1372
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,480
uh dan william

1373
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,960
yes okay and i'm presenting that dan

1374
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,880
wing um but go ahead and uh show the

1375
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,799
slides that'd be great well actually i

1376
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,720
just passed you control dan is that good

1377
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,680
enough

1378
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,078
that's good enough

1379
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,480
they seem to be sharing

1380
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,280
yes they are sharing oh sweet

1381
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,640
uh so i am dan wing uh

1382
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,200
one of the changes we made uh to split

1383
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,040
dns was uh

1384
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,040
had ben schwartz join us as an editor

1385
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,079
and contributor to the document

1386
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,839
so some of the let me run through some

1387
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,040
of the changes

1388
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,599
we've had from the last

1389
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,280
ietf meeting until now

1390
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,880
so uh there was a allowance previously

1391
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,520
for insect that's been removed to

1392
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,319
tighten up the domain camping that we're

1393
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,839
trying to avoid

1394
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,960
um and also remove the subdomain of of

1395
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
ns allowance that we had

1396
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,799
which was more complicated than

1397
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:58,880
necessary for the the solutions that

1398
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,200
we're trying to aim for

1399
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,920
ben also added a section on dns based

1400
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,160
validation and we've had a slew of

1401
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:10,000
editorial changes that make doing a diff

1402
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,520
more hard more complicated

1403
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,680
during the interim one of the things

1404
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,920
that we uncovered was

1405
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,240
some slight confusion on the scope for

1406
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,880
the document that uh it doesn't allow

1407
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,680
domain filtering uh and that's correct

1408
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,640
it doesn't uh it's it's only intended to

1409
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,480
work with a domain

1410
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,200
that you already own uh and we can

1411
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,359
verify by talking to a public name

1412
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:36,400
server

1413
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,400
or by doing a dns

1414
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,480
sec validation

1415
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,400
so we added a small

1416
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,359
scope

1417
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,839
sentence to the document and we might

1418
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,599
even

1419
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:50,079
start talking about tweaking the title

1420
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,799
to a verified split horizon

1421
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,400
as well

1422
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,559
and then as a

1423
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,839
these graphics didn't work out well

1424
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:00,640
um

1425
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,839
sorry about that

1426
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:02,880
um

1427
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,200
as a um

1428
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,520
reminder of of how the protocol works

1429
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,559
we're we're doing pvd and dnr

1430
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,319
which is up in the blue to get

1431
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,880
everything started so that's not new

1432
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,599
what this draft is proposing is the

1433
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,520
validation that happens at the bottom so

1434
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,680
what's shown there is talking to a

1435
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,640
public name server similarly we can

1436
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,839
validate by uh checking with dns sec

1437
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,599
which doesn't require going out to a

1438
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,880
public dna to a public dns server and

1439
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,480
asking it the question

1440
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,280
um but in both cases with what we're

1441
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,359
doing in the green section for the split

1442
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,960
horizon is verifying the ownership uh is

1443
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,839
legit you know that the the local dns

1444
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,280
claiming to own this zone

1445
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,680
really does have delegation for that

1446
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,759
zone from the public name servers

1447
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,640
and i'd really like to have some

1448
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,319
discussion we've had some good

1449
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,319
discussion at the interim we had some

1450
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:04,559
good discussion on the mailing list

1451
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,760
but certainly

1452
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,119
things in person are good

1453
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,680
looking for adoption

1454
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,200
as well as

1455
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,880
comments on the content um perhaps most

1456
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,119
interestingly or most important is are

1457
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,200
the secure validation mechanisms that we

1458
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,680
have in the document now sufficient for

1459
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,319
everyone's needs do we need to add more

1460
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:29,119
do we need fewer um you know the the

1461
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,520
same you know the the the typical

1462
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,119
we don't want too many standards to

1463
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,559
solve one problem

1464
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:35,440
issue

1465
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,960
but we want to make sure that we cover

1466
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,799
the use cases that folks are are

1467
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,359
concerned about and interested in

1468
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:44,480
that's all i have for slides

1469
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,720
i'm looking for a browser window

1470
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,799
here we are

1471
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:58,880
any questions our discussion around this

1472
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,000
mr lawrence you want to manage thecube

1473
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,960
yes ben ben schwartz has seen the queue

1474
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,760
oh you bet well ben was and then he

1475
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,400
dropped okay he's back now

1476
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,640
uh

1477
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,960
hi ben schwartz um

1478
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,599
you you mentioned the title um i think

1479
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,839
that's a really really good point i

1480
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:22,000
would go a little further even i think

1481
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,079
that maybe maybe this would all be a

1482
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,839
little clearer in terms of its purpose

1483
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:28,079
if we change the title to something like

1484
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,839
uh validating local claims of authority

1485
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,520
because that's really what this draft is

1486
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,359
about this is about

1487
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,440
uh situations where some some local

1488
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,559
entity

1489
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,119
tells you claims that they are uh

1490
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:44,799
authoritative that they have authority

1491
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,040
over some zone and you want to check

1492
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,640
that claim

1493
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,559
and then we have uh we present in the

1494
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:51,680
draft

1495
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,920
different mechanisms that you could use

1496
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,880
to to validate that local claim

1497
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,640
combining

1498
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,160
a bunch of different technologies that

1499
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,000
are that have come up in this in this

1500
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,280
working group

1501
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,880
uh the draft i think still references um

1502
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,839
uh provisioning domains as

1503
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:14,640
the example of where you would get these

1504
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,480
claims from but actually there are

1505
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,119
already other standards out there that

1506
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:21,119
do this in fact there's there's even an

1507
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,039
ancient dhcp

1508
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,160
option

1509
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,359
that allows the local dhcp server to

1510
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:30,319
claim authority over a particular set of

1511
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:32,480
domains uh you know no matter where the

1512
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,520
claim came from

1513
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,520
this draft describes some mechanisms

1514
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,240
that a client could use to validate it

1515
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:48,200
okay great thank you ben martin please

1516
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:53,280
uh hi martin munich

1517
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,440
uh i would like uh

1518
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,440
to mention uh two things uh one that uh

1519
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,880
in the process

1520
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,680
there is the requirement that name

1521
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,160
servers had to match between the step

1522
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,960
one and step 10 i think

1523
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,280
uh what if they are in a real uh split

1524
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,119
horizon

1525
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,319
when the addresses don't match because

1526
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,240
there are for example internal addresses

1527
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,200
used

1528
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,000
there's a one question i don't know if i

1529
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,760
have

1530
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,000
this right

1531
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,039
and

1532
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,319
the second one uh it seems to me that

1533
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:35,280
it's quite a complex process

1534
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,319
uh as i understand it there is first

1535
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:42,079
some dnr then detection of the domain

1536
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:46,720
then downloading json through uh https

1537
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,920
i'm not also don't know if i uh read it

1538
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,359
correctly

1539
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:55,760
uh i don't think every dns had to also

1540
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,000
run on https

1541
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,520
it wouldn't be

1542
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,960
impossible to

1543
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,920
do it

1544
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,319
by a record placed inside the zone for

1545
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:07,440
example srv or txt

1546
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,200
eventually the cnames to other zones

1547
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,240
um

1548
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,480
so yes it might be possible to do that

1549
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,319
um and and that's why we're asking if

1550
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:20,000
there's other secure mechanisms that we

1551
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,400
could use um and

1552
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,079
propose text

1553
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:26,799
and and we can add that um

1554
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:27,680
the

1555
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,680
reason that we're uh

1556
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,240
that we have the the two mechanisms we

1557
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,480
have there today remember what's what

1558
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,799
was shown on that one slide in green is

1559
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:40,000
not this not this document it's just you

1560
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,319
know how the information is conveyed to

1561
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:43,440
the client

1562
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,680
um so pbd is in there

1563
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,520
um and and

1564
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,000
those those steps are not

1565
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,240
part of what we're extending or creating

1566
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,079
or defining with this document it's just

1567
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,200
those last steps which is going out to

1568
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,760
the public dns and asking for the name

1569
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,280
server for the claimed local zone that

1570
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,960
the local name server is claiming

1571
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,960
ownership of and checking to see if the

1572
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,680
public dns agrees that that is supposed

1573
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,760
to be delegated down to this name down

1574
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
to the claimed main name server on the

1575
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,839
local network that's the only thing that

1576
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:16,880
we're adding

1577
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,839
as well as doing the same steps with dns

1578
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:20,880
sects

1579
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,640
and yes that does mean that the local

1580
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,200
name server needs to somehow

1581
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,240
get that authority from the public dns

1582
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,960
that it owns that zone

1583
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,200
and how it does that and where it does

1584
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,799
that when it does that

1585
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,640
is its own

1586
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,559
is its own problem

1587
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:41,599
um

1588
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,280
and not

1589
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,280
not something that we specify in the

1590
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,880
document

1591
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,400
okay thank you very much

1592
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,319
thank you dan uh eckerd please

1593
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,130
howdy i have um

1594
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,280
[Music]

1595
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,960
i have several questions about actual

1596
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,880
practicality um

1597
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,359
um the first is uh

1598
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,119
as i understand it from the discussion

1599
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:08,000
we had previously in many cases um

1600
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,839
enterprises do not wish to disclose the

1601
01:06:09,839 --> 01:06:12,000
existence of non-existence of certain

1602
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,839
demands so you know say i have

1603
01:06:14,839 --> 01:06:17,039
mail.example.com but i want to hide this

1604
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,039
and support.example.com

1605
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,079
um

1606
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,920
um in that case it seems mechanism will

1607
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,880
not work am i correct about that

1608
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,960
you would have to disclose that you have

1609
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,799
example.com you would not have to

1610
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,839
disclose

1611
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:34,000
mail.example.com uh okay okay i think i

1612
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,039
mean you should walk me through that

1613
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:37,599
because as i understand it um

1614
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,839
uh um

1615
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,079
uh

1616
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,680
what like

1617
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,440
so so let's take it let's hit the

1618
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,280
version of 4.1.1 right um if i guess

1619
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,400
maybe it depends on how you think the

1620
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,680
name servers work so i mean i'm

1621
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,960
imagining a situation where i have two

1622
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,480
names where i have like one name server

1623
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:55,839
which is like host like my external

1624
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:57,760
names are hosted by like say dreamhost

1625
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,200
and my internal name server is are

1626
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,680
hosted internally by some micro resolver

1627
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:05,920
and so um and so um when i um and so

1628
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,599
when the public resolver goes to resolve

1629
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,200
corp.example.com

1630
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,079
um

1631
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:11,039
uh

1632
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:15,079
what answers it going to give

1633
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,319
what is the ownership again it's going

1634
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,359
to get the internal let's get the

1635
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,680
internal resolution right

1636
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,280
but that how does that disclose jesus of

1637
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,240
course at example.com

1638
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
for his endless record like

1639
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,760
and its record for example.com um the

1640
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,240
points stream host um but then when i

1641
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,759
try to resolve corp what happens

1642
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,200
uh when you try to resolve the internal

1643
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,160
one

1644
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,880
that is not published uh publicly um

1645
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:44,960
you'll get an nx domain or some other

1646
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,799
failure

1647
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:48,400
and and so nx domain is considered

1648
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,599
sufficient to demonstrate that it should

1649
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:51,680
be resolved locally

1650
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:52,799
no

1651
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:56,759
but i don't understand how this works

1652
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,599
okay

1653
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,599
ben are you joining to add clarification

1654
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,799
you're muted then oh thank you uh

1655
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:09,200
attempt to clarify it um

1656
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,960
the

1657
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,559
in the architecture you're describing

1658
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,880
essentially yes uh the existence of

1659
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,839
corp.example.com if it's if it's

1660
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:20,479
delegated separately uh from the rest of

1661
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,839
example.com the existence of

1662
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,960
corp.example.com becomes a matter of

1663
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,359
public record but the domains underneath

1664
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,960
it do not

1665
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,040
okay i have no personal problem

1666
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,479
sorry

1667
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,799
and that i think is in my view that that

1668
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,120
is a an entirely

1669
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,960
workable and reasonable architecture

1670
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,399
generally the existence of

1671
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,880
corp.example.com is not

1672
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,399
a secret but people might have then

1673
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,640
thousands of names underneath it that

1674
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,880
they would rather not resolve publicly

1675
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,960
so i personally agree with you however

1676
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,238
that was not the impression i got from

1677
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:55,920
the from the previous discussion in the

1678
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,520
discussion in the latin and that last ad

1679
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,560
hoc meeting

1680
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,158
um

1681
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:01,198
uh

1682
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:02,640
the um

1683
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,479
uh

1684
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,120
the the second question i had um

1685
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,799
and i'm sorry like i i did review this

1686
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,719
draft previously but i sort of like lost

1687
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:14,000
um i i sort of lost uh uh

1688
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,158
uh uh

1689
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:16,960
um

1690
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,560
the plot a little bit um is um

1691
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,759
are you assuming that there is um that

1692
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:24,880
the

1693
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,960
uh the the internal resolver is

1694
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,880
identified by domain name

1695
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,279
um and that that you have to know enough

1696
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,198
to make anything a secure connection

1697
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:35,679
that internal resolver or is restored to

1698
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,560
resolver um potentially if i i'll

1699
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,319
probably buy ip address

1700
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:43,120
um and you make it to v3 connection

1701
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,960
by name

1702
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,238
okay

1703
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:49,359
thank you

1704
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,319
tommy paulie please

1705
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,800
hello uh just following on on

1706
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,880
the conversation here and ben we're

1707
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,000
having

1708
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,840
i i just wanted to ask to clarify

1709
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:07,679
in that corp.example.com

1710
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,960
you could also very reasonably just have

1711
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,199
example.com so like i joined a network

1712
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,280
and it says i get all of example.com

1713
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,520
because i am the company that owns

1714
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,040
example.com and i have lots of private

1715
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,800
stuff here and there's also public

1716
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,080
things

1717
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,560
and in that case if the

1718
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,960
delegation is for all of example.com

1719
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,199
i i would just end up resolving both the

1720
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,280
internal and external things

1721
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,199
to that encrypted resolver on my local

1722
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,800
network and

1723
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,640
that's presumably okay

1724
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,040
is that how it would work

1725
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,520
yes and and that was the example that's

1726
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,920
on slide five that got corrupted during

1727
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,120
the

1728
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,960
meet you upload

1729
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,560
but it's also the example that's in the

1730
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,280
specification

1731
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,120
welcome back

1732
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,520
that eckerd work correctly because

1733
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,320
um

1734
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,880
uh then then what because as i

1735
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,239
understand it the way this works is that

1736
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,960
the um is that the public name server um

1737
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,199
responds with uh um

1738
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,360
the publication server responds with

1739
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:14,400
uh the name of someone to contact

1740
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:17,199
and um so now you're replicating they

1741
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,040
replicating the names both internally

1742
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,320
externally but the blue records this

1743
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,360
just seems like actually quite a

1744
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,199
comprehensive version to have like the

1745
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:25,600
idea of the who own who the name server

1746
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,960
is for example.com be different

1747
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,840
externally internally

1748
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,760
great thank you and that was the cue

1749
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:43,360
all right thank you um

1750
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:44,880
dan can you pass control back over

1751
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,040
please

1752
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,560
should have it now

1753
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,199
thank you so much sir

1754
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,480
okay so the next item on our agenda

1755
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,719
is um the never policy to use network

1756
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:03,440
designated dns resolvers uh who's

1757
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:06,919
talking to this one

1758
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,239
you have it sir

1759
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,320
okay can you see the slides

1760
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,920
because we do

1761
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,120
okay wait

1762
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,040
yeah uh

1763
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,480
uh

1764
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:48,159
yeah i'm through from akamai so this

1765
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,640
draft is uh the problem that this draft

1766
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,000
is trying to solve is there several

1767
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,760
networks which

1768
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,760
wants endpoints to use the network

1769
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,199
signal resolvers

1770
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,199
but unfortunately they don't have any

1771
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:02,719
mechanism to inform the end point about

1772
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,480
this network policy if this network

1773
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,880
policy is not informed and let's say the

1774
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,800
end point is using let's say a

1775
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,120
non-network signal resolver it could

1776
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,280
cause various adverse effects like

1777
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,600
security alerts or blocking the client

1778
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,159
entirely or it could be

1779
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,679
quarantining the client so we were

1780
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,159
looking at ways to solve that problem uh

1781
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:25,600
beyond uh using the extended error codes

1782
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,840
if the client is directly reaching some

1783
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,840
other resolver using an ip address or

1784
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,719
other mechanisms

1785
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,280
for that what we have done is we have

1786
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,159
picked

1787
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:38,000
the explicit web pvd very similar to

1788
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
what the split horizontalness does which

1789
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,600
basically gives you extra additional

1790
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,000
information of the network and in that

1791
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,920
we have added two new case one is the

1792
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,920
key to indicate that the policy allows

1793
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,880
only using network signal dns resolvers

1794
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,520
and the reason why uh and code basically

1795
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:55,760
to indicate the reason why uh it wants

1796
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,640
the end point to use its the networked

1797
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,159
signal resolver and not some other

1798
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:02,719
resolver

1799
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,159
a very simplistic example is this web

1800
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,080
dvd is giving various information about

1801
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,080
prefixes when this prefixes expire and

1802
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,000
what is the identifier it's also giving

1803
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,760
additional pvds that we are introducing

1804
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,679
in this draft which is to say that

1805
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,280
it's requesting the end points to use

1806
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,080
the network signal resolver and and then

1807
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,920
internal security policy because it

1808
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,560
which it wants the endpoints to use the

1809
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,679
uh

1810
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:29,480
network provided resolver

1811
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:31,600
and

1812
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,600
the signal is just just a feedback

1813
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,840
basically it's an internal security

1814
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,679
policy expression by the operator of the

1815
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,600
network and it's definitely not a policy

1816
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,600
prescription uh the endpoints can

1817
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,760
definitely ignore and try to use uh

1818
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,440
public resolvers if they are reachable

1819
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,120
and and they can continue to establish

1820
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,239
communication

1821
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,640
uh this this uh we are currently

1822
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,120
proposing it as a strictly opt-in for

1823
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,040
explicitly trusted networks by the end

1824
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,520
user it could be used in any network it

1825
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,199
would also be used in let's say

1826
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,040
enterprise networks without mdm for

1827
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,440
example nowadays we are seeing various

1828
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,400
uh types of pod devices with uh a very

1829
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,080
lightweight host agent which only

1830
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,679
conveys the poster assessment back to

1831
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:11,120
the enterprise network and we don't have

1832
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:14,560
a fully uh managed mdm kind of a device

1833
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,159
so in those kind of

1834
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,920
devices where we don't have a

1835
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,679
configuration profile or an mdm this

1836
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:23,560
would also be quite useful

1837
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,640
uh any comments and suggestions are

1838
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,920
welcome whether this is the right

1839
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,920
working group for this so do you think

1840
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,520
there is a there's interest to solve

1841
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,679
this problem

1842
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,760
polly please

1843
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,880
all right um

1844
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,960
thank you so i i had one comment on

1845
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,679
the use and interpretation of a

1846
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,960
provisioning domain here

1847
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,480
which is that it seems a little odd

1848
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,880
for this

1849
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,199
provisioning domain to tell you

1850
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,600
don't use

1851
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,440
another resolver

1852
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,800
because

1853
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,920
using another resolver implies that the

1854
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,600
device

1855
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,440
is essentially using another

1856
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,719
provisioning domain because a

1857
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,840
provisioning domain is the set of all of

1858
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,040
the configuration like ip addresses and

1859
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,440
prefixes and dns server so

1860
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,719
you know

1861
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,520
even if my

1862
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,600
system is choosing to use other dns

1863
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,080
resolvers for particular use cases

1864
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,440
it still has

1865
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,840
the provisioning domain defined for this

1866
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,440
network as the one with the network

1867
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,560
resolver

1868
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,280
and that always should be the case

1869
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,159
um

1870
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,560
so i i think it's the problem i have

1871
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:49,760
here is

1872
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,960
in how do i interpret this because

1873
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:54,400
let's say i have another provisioning

1874
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,320
domain which is a vpn

1875
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,040
that i'm using that vpn

1876
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,199
has its own dns resolver since

1877
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,520
one of my pvds told me

1878
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,040
don't use any other dns other than mine

1879
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,800
should i now say like i'm not allowed to

1880
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,840
use vpn or i'm not allowed to use my

1881
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,080
cellular network which has its own dns

1882
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,239
like it gets a bit

1883
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,880
complicated and perhaps

1884
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:22,800
if we wanted to go down this route it

1885
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,239
would be better to express it as

1886
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,600
a

1887
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,800
upfront claim that by the way

1888
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,719
this network will

1889
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,880
intentionally try to block

1890
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,000
traffic

1891
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:36,880
to

1892
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,520
known public resolvers or to vpns or to

1893
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,199
proxies or

1894
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:43,520
essentially telling telling you up front

1895
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,760
here is the kind of adversarial security

1896
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,360
stance you're going to encounter on this

1897
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,480
network

1898
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,760
rather than

1899
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,679
telling a device oh you shouldn't use

1900
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,760
someone else's dns because that

1901
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,000
interpretation seems to be much

1902
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,520
fuzzier

1903
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:00,080
okay so you're using just uh had a flag

1904
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:03,920
to indicate that and we're good to go

1905
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,000
okay i

1906
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,159
was that it tommy it looks like it uh

1907
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,719
ben please

1908
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,560
hey uh as i said on the on the mailing

1909
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,080
list that i don't

1910
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,199
uh i don't like this general direction

1911
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,000
um

1912
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,840
i think that

1913
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,560
that we're we're this draft is really

1914
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:30,080
trying to

1915
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,880
trying to fix a problem that that isn't

1916
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:35,440
fixable and it's trying to work in a

1917
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,239
space that i think is

1918
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,000
not where we should be focusing our

1919
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,880
efforts and not where the the future of

1920
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,560
secure networking is

1921
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,679
you talked a little bit about

1922
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,199
lightweight host agents as an

1923
01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:49,360
alternative to mdm

1924
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:51,280
you know the the behavior that i'm

1925
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,280
seeing more commonly is um is device is

1926
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,520
partitioned device state where the

1927
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,640
device has an mdm inside a contained

1928
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,760
profile that is separate from

1929
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,080
um from other profiles so you could call

1930
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,640
this i guess you could call this byod if

1931
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,800
you want but actually the network only

1932
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,800
ever interacts with a container that is

1933
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,360
effectively a fully managed device so

1934
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:16,719
it's not really

1935
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,640
byod in the way that we usually talk

1936
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:19,840
about it it's a

1937
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,760
like it's a secure network where only

1938
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,199
fully managed

1939
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,679
devices or contacts can access the

1940
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,120
network and in that context we don't

1941
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,000
need any of this because the network ad

1942
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,480
administrators have total control over

1943
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,560
the network configuration inside that

1944
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,080
container

1945
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,800
yeah i agree ben i mean if you have a

1946
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,520
body device within container which is a

1947
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,600
split configuration profile which is

1948
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,679
fully managed mdm you don't require that

1949
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,040
but this is this use case is

1950
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,199
specifically for networks where you

1951
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,520
don't have that kind of

1952
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,600
configuration profile specific mdm

1953
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,639
great thank you martin

1954
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,040
i would like to point out one thing i uh

1955
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,000
the thing is quite uh important

1956
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,840
uh i think that uh any uh other for

1957
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,239
example doh third-party resolver should

1958
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:17,760
be opt-in

1959
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,880
by definition not opt out

1960
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,600
so

1961
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,800
uh

1962
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:25,440
if is this this is the case then we

1963
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,480
would not need uh some signaling that uh

1964
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,360
use on in this dns

1965
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,880
because uh usually at my point of view

1966
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,280
uh you don't have

1967
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,440
in most of the cases you won't have any

1968
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:42,159
benefits running third-party dns in the

1969
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,520
first place

1970
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,920
there might be some cases when there's a

1971
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,840
censorship or dns of some filtering or

1972
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,920
something like this but it should be the

1973
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,000
user it should be the one which says

1974
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,120
the computer to use other dns

1975
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,440
and if so then

1976
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,800
there should be no

1977
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,000
way how to block user from doing so

1978
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,800
some implementation like

1979
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,440
i think the mozilla which

1980
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,080
activates that uh by default the third

1981
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,760
party i think it would be even harmful

1982
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,080
to user privacy

1983
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,480
by giving the information of a

1984
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,320
resolution to a third party which

1985
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,840
wouldn't have this information in the

1986
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,040
first place

1987
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,880
so i think it's uh

1988
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,760
uh

1989
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,520
important to

1990
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,560
uh

1991
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,159
somehow

1992
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,560
state that uh make some even a

1993
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,080
recommendation rfc about using those

1994
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,800
third parties in the first place and

1995
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,360
then uh maybe solve the issue of

1996
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,520
signaling that okay don't use it

1997
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,719
if there will be no the link to

1998
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:55,760
update

1999
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,679
such recommendations or do such

2000
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,760
recommendations then yes we probably

2001
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,800
need some standard form of signaling

2002
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,840
of not using third parties but

2003
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:06,880
i think

2004
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,560
it should be first opt in

2005
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,520
i mean whether it's opt-in or opt-out

2006
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,199
what we have seen is we have seen

2007
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:19,679
endpoints joining enterprise networks

2008
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,679
with using third-party resources we

2009
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:23,040
don't know whether the user has

2010
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,120
explicitly configured its use or it was

2011
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:25,840
a

2012
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:27,679
pre-loaded software which came with and

2013
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,760
pre-built third party resolver that it

2014
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,320
was hard coded and allowed to use but

2015
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,480
then with all these metal boxes and dns

2016
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,239
filtering we are forced to basically

2017
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:39,360
block those and what we are seeing is uh

2018
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,760
the end user basically seeing that

2019
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,360
it's unable to connect to the internet

2020
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,280
and that's causing lots of turmoil and

2021
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,000
uh

2022
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,639
and concerns with regard to uh not able

2023
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:50,960
to uh use the use the enterprise

2024
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,480
networks and if you see

2025
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,320
any dns filtering enterprise genius

2026
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,480
filtering service that you see today has

2027
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,600
a policy which is basically categorizing

2028
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,280
some of these non-network provided

2029
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,880
resolvers as

2030
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,040
anonymous resolvers and blocking them

2031
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,920
but i i see that as an uh half-baked

2032
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,000
solution it's not fully solving the

2033
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
problem that it's actually causing the

2034
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,199
end point to degrade to uh dns or 53 uh

2035
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:16,800
and and that's the whole reason this

2036
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,360
graph talks about that hey if somebody's

2037
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,840
downgrading you prompt the user and let

2038
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,440
the user make a choice if it wants to

2039
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,199
connect to the encrypted results

2040
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,560
provided by the network whether it's a

2041
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,280
trusted network or not and and then then

2042
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:31,360
make a call whether uh this this

2043
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,760
blocking by the network is something

2044
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,800
that the user is willing to uh agree and

2045
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,120
fall back to clear text dns or wants to

2046
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,360
just abandon this network because it

2047
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,719
doesn't trust the network and wants to

2048
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,719
do some connect to some other network

2049
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,239
but but it's it's basically trying to

2050
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,639
improve the user because what what is

2051
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,159
happening at the network is just

2052
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,800
happening and in one way without giving

2053
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,360
them a hint to the user on why why it's

2054
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,960
not able to reach this resource whether

2055
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,600
it's because the server is down or or my

2056
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,960
routes are down or is it because the

2057
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,239
network is blocking it that's the

2058
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,880
feedback it is giving back to the user

2059
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,360
okay and what important model user or

2060
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,840
end implementation would do is is

2061
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,120
this

2062
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:14,080
it empowers the endpoint and the user to

2063
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,480
make right choices after that

2064
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,360
okay i just wanted to say that it should

2065
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:21,600
be a good idea it would be a good idea

2066
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,000
to do some kind of recommendation or

2067
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,040
even bcp for for this uh usage of

2068
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:33,040
these uh third parties thank you

2069
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,000
great thank you martin and tiru um

2070
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,520
lorenzo you are the last for this draft

2071
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,159
uh hey lorenzo collier um yeah i'm sort

2072
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:44,719
of a little bit confused why

2073
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:45,920
you know what

2074
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,679
what effect this might have right like

2075
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,920
in general like devices will

2076
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,600
default to the network provided dns

2077
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,719
resolvers

2078
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:53,920
if they don't do that it's usually

2079
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,560
because they have a reason not to do it

2080
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,320
and you know that reason might be an

2081
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,600
application that wants to use its own

2082
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,199
dns resolver

2083
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,960
and uh

2084
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,480
or the user configured it to use a

2085
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:06,480
different dns resolver in none of those

2086
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,960
cases will such a hint help

2087
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,120
um it will just basically tell the

2088
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,560
device what it already knows that this

2089
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,159
network doesn't meet its security

2090
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,440
requirements

2091
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,679
and you know present the choice to the

2092
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:18,960
user

2093
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,639
um

2094
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,000
the device

2095
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,080
already has to deal with

2096
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,000
any network that blocks these

2097
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,159
third-party resolvers without using this

2098
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:29,520
option

2099
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,040
and it doesn't seem like having this

2100
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,199
option would be any sort of meaningful

2101
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,719
improvement in security or user

2102
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,679
experience or anything really because

2103
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:39,520
the choices that are that are presented

2104
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,760
to the to the owner of the device are

2105
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,719
the same

2106
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,239
regardless of whether it's blocked

2107
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,880
intentionally or not it doesn't work and

2108
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,560
so the user has to decide whether

2109
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,639
fallback is appropriate

2110
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,080
so i don't see why having a hint would

2111
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,159
be useful

2112
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,960
yeah it could be that

2113
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,840
yeah

2114
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
i mean if it's blocked and if there's an

2115
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,920
alternative that the user wants to pick

2116
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,000
because let's say some resolver is not

2117
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,239
reachable versus a network actively

2118
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,440
blocking it is a quite different

2119
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,679
scenario which is probably fixable after

2120
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:12,080
a few seconds uh if there's a router

2121
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,040
flap or my routes are not up but this is

2122
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,960
this is saying that if you join the

2123
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,840
network it's blocked indefinitely

2124
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,679
okay thank you lorenzo and teru and back

2125
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:27,760
to you glenn

2126
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,000
well not for very long teru you are up

2127
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,080
again you have one more

2128
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,000
uh slide set to present so why don't you

2129
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,679
just keep control um the next topic is

2130
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,480
uh dns resolver info uh

2131
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,040
the draft uh interior of 10 minutes plus

2132
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,800
some discussion time

2133
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,880
sure yeah i'll keep it short i mean this

2134
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,719
draft was discussed several times in the

2135
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,480
working group in the past there was a

2136
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:52,000
lot of feedback that we got on this

2137
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,760
draft but at that time the high priority

2138
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,719
was to make progress on dnr and area and

2139
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,480
this draft took a backseat so we're

2140
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:00,800
trying to bring it back to the

2141
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,239
just remind the working group of this

2142
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,920
work and whether we want to adapt this

2143
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,120
work because at that time we had

2144
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,280
addressed all the comments from the

2145
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,560
working group

2146
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,639
so this was basically introduced because

2147
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,639
we had in our charter that

2148
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:13,840
we would like to provide more

2149
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,600
information about the dns resolver

2150
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,280
beyond what's being conveyed with the

2151
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,520
discovery mechanisms that are there and

2152
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,239
that would probably help the client

2153
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:23,760
making

2154
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,800
a selection decision

2155
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,639
i mean we already have two mechanisms

2156
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,679
for discovering uh dns resolvers but we

2157
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,000
don't have a mechanism to discover uh

2158
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,120
what is the

2159
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,159
appropriate dns interesting uh dns

2160
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:41,679
resolver information and that

2161
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:43,199
functionality is missing and that's what

2162
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:46,000
this craft is trying to provide

2163
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,360
so what we have done as part of this

2164
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,679
draft is introduce a new resource record

2165
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:51,840
type called resinfo it could be either

2166
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,320
used with dnr or ddr with dnr it will be

2167
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,920
used with the domain name and with

2168
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,960
ddr it would be used with resolver. and

2169
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:02,480
we're basically retaining structured

2170
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,800
json and uh

2171
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,719
we have defined several feeds based on

2172
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:08,880
the discussions that we had working in

2173
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,120
the working group to remove several ones

2174
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,040
which were not agreed upon and we we

2175
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,760
stuck to an minimal uh set of fields

2176
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,080
that there was strong consensus at that

2177
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,280
point of time

2178
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,360
and the

2179
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,880
and the two mechanisms which basically

2180
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,040
that this draft talks about either uh

2181
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,960
after you establish a secure connection

2182
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,719
you can download this resolver

2183
01:28:28,719 --> 01:28:30,639
information from the

2184
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,880
encrypted dns server or it could be

2185
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,040
prior to establishing the dns connection

2186
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,040
you could do if you have the local dns

2187
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,639
validation enabled you could use you

2188
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,360
could use dns as well to make sure

2189
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,040
no one samples

2190
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,880
this data

2191
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:47,920
so basically the current list of uh

2192
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:49,760
discovered information is basically

2193
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,920
whether the resolver supports q name

2194
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,480
minimization whether it has support for

2195
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,960
extended dns error codes

2196
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:58,400
whether it requires any client

2197
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:00,880
authentication or not and

2198
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,719
an url that points to a generally

2199
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:04,480
constructed resolver information it

2200
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:07,280
could have various http status error

2201
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,199
codes it would trace it return whom to

2202
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,600
contact for troubleshooting

2203
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,120
and the do jps supported and an url that

2204
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,880
points to a human-friendly description

2205
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,679
of the resolver identity and we could

2206
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,120
add a lot more information based on the

2207
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,960
discussion in the working group and

2208
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,800
the request and adoption for this draft

2209
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,639
and any comments on this draft has

2210
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,639
become

2211
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,840
hi ben schwartz

2212
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,239
uh i i think we should probably adopt

2213
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,080
this draft um

2214
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,400
i think of this as

2215
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:02,080
uh finally a replacement for

2216
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,239
the like weird chaos zone bind dot

2217
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:07,360
version

2218
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,360
thing or like various other weird

2219
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,520
implementation specific

2220
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,400
uh

2221
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,960
resolver configuration info

2222
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:16,639
records that the different

2223
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,719
implementations have

2224
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:21,840
kind of just kind of put out there in in

2225
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:24,080
on squatting on different names uh i

2226
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,320
feel like you know there's proof that

2227
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,840
that people want that kind of

2228
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,000
information and we should provide a more

2229
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,679
standard way to do it i'm not exactly

2230
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:32,639
sure

2231
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:34,880
that the specific metadata

2232
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,199
mentioned in this draft is what we want

2233
01:30:37,199 --> 01:30:38,800
to present but

2234
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:39,679
uh

2235
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,679
but i think some mechanism like this is

2236
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:43,520
worthwhile and this is a good enough

2237
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,679
starting point

2238
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:46,880
yeah

2239
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,480
thanks ben thank you ben

2240
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:51,199
uh dkj

2241
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,159
um

2242
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,280
i

2243
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,679
it's hard to hear you

2244
01:30:57,679 --> 01:30:59,920
uh sorry is this any better

2245
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,360
yeah um

2246
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,000
i can i can see ben's point about uh we

2247
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,280
should probably adopt something like

2248
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,560
this just so there is a standard way to

2249
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,960
do it i want to flag two specific

2250
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,080
concerns

2251
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,520
um one of them is that uh reporting

2252
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:16,000
lots of details about a given machine's

2253
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,080
configuration in other contexts has

2254
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,719
caused uh concerns right i believe for

2255
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:21,920
example

2256
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,400
a lot of web servers are

2257
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,239
reluctant to report things like the

2258
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:27,920
version of the web server that they're

2259
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:31,760
running even though they used to do that

2260
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,760
so that typically i think is for

2261
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,199
security concerns

2262
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:36,880
but in this uh

2263
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,400
thank you for going to this slide this

2264
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,080
this slide in particular

2265
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,679
i'm concerned about

2266
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,199
the bindings between the urls here

2267
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,679
um and the actual service and what's to

2268
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:49,920
stop me from pointing to

2269
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,239
a url that describes some other server

2270
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,480
and people using that to make a decision

2271
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,000
i feel like this is a

2272
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,800
there's some really sort of problematic

2273
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:01,440
uh dynamics here if if this discovered

2274
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,440
information is actually used to select a

2275
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,639
resolver

2276
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:06,639
um

2277
01:32:06,639 --> 01:32:07,840
i don't even know how you know that

2278
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:09,679
you're getting the resolver that these

2279
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:13,040
urls describe um

2280
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,679
and that seems like an issue i also am

2281
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:17,199
very reluctant to

2282
01:32:17,199 --> 01:32:18,800
to include this required client

2283
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,560
authentication just because

2284
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,120
client authentication for dns resolvers

2285
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:26,800
uh is not generally currently done and

2286
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,800
uh

2287
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,639
you know the idea that somebody has a

2288
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:32,719
list of every dns lookup that i made

2289
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:35,280
associated with me personally

2290
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,080
is is pretty troubling

2291
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:39,280
so i you know

2292
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,120
those are these are these are my main

2293
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,800
caveats about the data that's being

2294
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,600
offered here um and i i agree that if

2295
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,480
we're gonna define something that's

2296
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:49,199
worth having it in this group

2297
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,280
that's good feedback thanks daniel i i

2298
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,800
think i get your point with regard to i

2299
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:53,920
think you're referring to an attack

2300
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,960
where and

2301
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:57,199
malicious dns server basically points to

2302
01:32:57,199 --> 01:32:58,880
an url which which takes you to

2303
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,440
somewhere with regard to uh some bad

2304
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:03,199
feedback to the user in prompting to do

2305
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,360
something uh which would uh damage the

2306
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:09,799
endpoints poster i get that

2307
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,960
my concern is more that like i set up my

2308
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:16,080
own resolver i know that uh say

2309
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:17,840
cloudflare publishes some policies where

2310
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,920
people are generally fine with i set up

2311
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,840
my own resolver and the discovered

2312
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:23,520
information i say oh by the way you can

2313
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,159
check out um details about my resolver

2314
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,400
you can see that it's um

2315
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,480
uh it's and i just point to cloudflare's

2316
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:32,719
data is that anyone looking at the at

2317
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:34,480
the pieces of information is like oh

2318
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,400
yeah that's player i'll use that but

2319
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:39,440
it's not it's actually my server

2320
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,678
thanks

2321
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,080
thank you dkg echo please

2322
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,000
yeah i think the key point actually is

2323
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
the one that the just made a second ago

2324
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,679
which is it's not actually that the

2325
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:51,440
terms of cloudflare offers are great

2326
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:52,880
that you look and you're like oh it's

2327
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,560
cloudflare this is totally criminal

2328
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,239
right um because like obviously you

2329
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:59,040
could just copy the terms right um

2330
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,159
uh

2331
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:01,040
um

2332
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,639
i think if if

2333
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,120
so i think i i would just i would say

2334
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,639
especially spanish in two ways um one is

2335
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,320
is anybody gonna use it

2336
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,280
um and i guess i'd like to ask like

2337
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:15,360
um which uh

2338
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:18,159
which client providers um seem likely to

2339
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:20,480
report this data in any void of the user

2340
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:22,800
um i don't believe we would um and i'd

2341
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:23,920
like so i guess i like that you know i

2342
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:25,280
don't see time policies here maybe tiny

2343
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,040
jensen's here um maybe they could talk

2344
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,480
about whether they'd be i'm interested

2345
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,719
in providing this to users because um

2346
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:31,840
you know we can publish as much as we

2347
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,040
want but if no one's going to surface it

2348
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,400
then it's not worth doing

2349
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:35,360
um

2350
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,440
second i think that the point dkg made

2351
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,880
um i think makes it really clear that

2352
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,719
like it has to be that there has to be

2353
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:42,719
some cryptographic binding between the

2354
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:44,560
published information and the server

2355
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,119
itself um as opposed to merely a simple

2356
01:34:47,119 --> 01:34:49,519
assertion

2357
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,199
so i guess

2358
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:52,639
i'll be more excited about adopting this

2359
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:53,840
if i hear from someone who just think it

2360
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:55,760
says they would use it

2361
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,960
sure

2362
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,360
great thank you ecker

2363
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,839
please

2364
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:07,920
all right could you hear from google

2365
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,840
i think

2366
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,000
extending some of the comments just made

2367
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,280
i would say it makes sense to

2368
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:17,760
separate out

2369
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,239
the information which is provided into

2370
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:22,320
two parts one is purely protocol

2371
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,320
specific like where the queue name is

2372
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,600
supported ede is supported etc

2373
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,080
and any other information which is more

2374
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:31,840
policy like

2375
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:35,280
like the urls or anything else

2376
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,520
maybe even two separate endpoints or two

2377
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,840
separate uh rr types for them just to

2378
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:43,760
separate them out

2379
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,159
and in terms of implementation i would

2380
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:49,199
say maybe for the protocol features we

2381
01:35:49,199 --> 01:35:51,280
look at extending

2382
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,520
edns zero to encapsulate that

2383
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:55,280
information

2384
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,800
and i can share more

2385
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,880
thoughts there on the list itself

2386
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,040
thanks for anything

2387
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:05,280
great thank you penny and glenn that

2388
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,239
looks like that was the cube

2389
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,520
well um thank you could you uh pass

2390
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,280
control back over

2391
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,119
to myself please

2392
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,360
yes

2393
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,080
and uh the next one we're gonna have up

2394
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,320
is um ben

2395
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,800
um schwartz

2396
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:25,920
and

2397
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,239
ben let me pass control over to you so

2398
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,000
you can present

2399
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,239
i don't see ben in the queue

2400
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:35,638
did ben drop

2401
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,159
okay

2402
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,920
thank you ben

2403
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:44,800
hello

2404
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,080
okay this should be this should be quick

2405
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,960
so

2406
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,280
this is about uh

2407
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,960
a an individual draft

2408
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,159
that uh is from me and chris box

2409
01:36:58,159 --> 01:37:00,239
although it's it's based on

2410
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:02,800
observations made by a lot of other

2411
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,239
people who've thought about the problem

2412
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:05,040
of

2413
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:08,800
how ddr acts with good old-fashioned

2414
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,159
local

2415
01:37:10,159 --> 01:37:12,159
dns forwarders on your home router and

2416
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:14,320
that sort of thing

2417
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,719
as a reminder this is the situation

2418
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,040
we're talking about you have a client

2419
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,520
with a local network ip address they're

2420
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:24,239
talking to a dns forwarder

2421
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:26,159
they were told you know

2422
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,400
your dns server is at this local ip

2423
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:29,520
address

2424
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:30,800
it's actually

2425
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,320
they don't know this necessarily but

2426
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,960
it's actually just a forwarder to

2427
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:35,920
some

2428
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:38,239
upstream recursive probably operated by

2429
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,080
an isp

2430
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:43,920
a lot of isps have have set up

2431
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,400
encrypted resolver support which is

2432
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,280
great

2433
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,080
but these clients aren't able to access

2434
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,239
it because

2435
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,639
ddrs

2436
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:56,960
default upgrade rules

2437
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:58,000
say that

2438
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,280
the uh the the ip address has to match

2439
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:03,840
in this case and effectively it doesn't

2440
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,320
it can't match and you can't prove

2441
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,400
cryptographically you you can't prove

2442
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,480
ownership of a private ip address so

2443
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,639
so could we get dns over tls here and

2444
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:18,880
what this draft does is

2445
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,400
it describes

2446
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,320
it's purely informational because it

2447
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:25,119
describes a client policy

2448
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:27,199
and clients have all kinds of very

2449
01:38:27,199 --> 01:38:29,600
strong opinions about what their

2450
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,000
resolver selection policies should look

2451
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:33,280
like so

2452
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:35,119
this draft doesn't attempt to tell

2453
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,119
anybody what they ought to do

2454
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,719
it just tries to go through and describe

2455
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:43,440
a client policy that would upgrade in

2456
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,639
this

2457
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,719
in this situation or really a family of

2458
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,639
client policies that

2459
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,800
that would be able to upgrade in this

2460
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,440
situation and also identifies as some

2461
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,280
some of the problems that come up when

2462
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,280
you try to do that

2463
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,880
and also offers

2464
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,080
or describes some mitigations

2465
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,960
that

2466
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,400
apply to those problems although um you

2467
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,880
know don't necessarily totally resolve

2468
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,400
them

2469
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:13,520
and you know ultimately the judgment of

2470
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:15,440
which of these problems are relevant

2471
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,960
which of these mitigations are

2472
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,280
sufficient uh you know this draft

2473
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:21,280
doesn't address that and leaves that in

2474
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:23,440
the hands of essentially client

2475
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,360
implementers to consider

2476
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,280
but it does try to describe in detail

2477
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,320
what the consequences are likely to be

2478
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,480
so this has been presented here before

2479
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,480
it hasn't really changed since the last

2480
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:35,679
ietf

2481
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:38,000
one change that's been valuable is that

2482
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,480
the ddr draft language has been

2483
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:42,800
slightly adjusted so that

2484
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,080
it's clear that the the ddr default

2485
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,560
client policy is not the only policy

2486
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,000
that's allowed

2487
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,679
uh that's now very clear in the ddr

2488
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:52,880
draft

2489
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,679
and we're seeking adoption here for this

2490
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:56,719
draft

2491
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:59,040
thanks

2492
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,679
thanks ben and let me let me make a

2493
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,320
couple comments on the adoption um so

2494
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:07,920
the main concern that the chairs have

2495
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:10,159
expressed was that this particular draft

2496
01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:13,040
was bad you're on the air

2497
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:16,080
uh glenn was

2498
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:17,520
when are you done saying what you were

2499
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,239
saying

2500
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:19,760
no no

2501
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,840
all right i did you repeat that i i had

2502
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,520
my audio set up wrong

2503
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,040
okay man i i was going to say that um

2504
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,040
the chair's main concern with the

2505
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,960
adoption call was they had little

2506
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,639
discussion on the list

2507
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,040
um so that's why you know been presented

2508
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,400
here today he's put some stuff on the

2509
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,360
list

2510
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:40,159
um you know i think we're ready to issue

2511
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:42,639
the uh adoption call uh but it would be

2512
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,960
really great to hear from the members of

2513
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,239
the add

2514
01:40:46,239 --> 01:40:48,400
uh family on on their thoughts on those

2515
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,360
drives so i i guess then the short

2516
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,360
answer is we will be issuing the the

2517
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,119
adoption calls soon

2518
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,960
um and we look forward to hearing what

2519
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,440
people think

2520
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:03,600
okay thank you terry please

2521
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,159
hey hey ben i've configured the draft

2522
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:08,639
and uh it's a good start and i

2523
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:10,400
definitely support adapting it but i had

2524
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:13,360
several concerns on some of the

2525
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,199
deployment models that you had captured

2526
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,520
in especially if you go back to the

2527
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,080
slide we're talking about uh the legacy

2528
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:22,960
router not being uh uh upgradeable to

2529
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:26,239
support to activity servers i see one i

2530
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:27,920
see two types of legacy servers that are

2531
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:30,159
always there legacy servers whose

2532
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,880
firmware could be updated versus legacy

2533
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,719
routers whose firmware cannot be updated

2534
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:36,400
and this seems to be supporting both the

2535
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,360
cases

2536
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:39,840
and the third one is basically hey the

2537
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:42,159
isp can manage the home router and it

2538
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,600
can change the configuration in which

2539
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,639
case this draft is not required right

2540
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:48,400
and covering the threat models in all

2541
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,520
these cases and especially uh one uh

2542
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,679
security considerations that i saw this

2543
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:56,080
mitigation this draft talks about was uh

2544
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,840
the two mitigations that he talks about

2545
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,280
was basically one relying on a trr

2546
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,119
i was wondering how this would scale

2547
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,239
with

2548
01:42:04,239 --> 01:42:07,119
so many diverse trrs being used by

2549
01:42:07,119 --> 01:42:09,360
browsers and operating systems how would

2550
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,119
this be deployable and the second one

2551
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:12,840
was with regard to

2552
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:16,719
uh relying on end user uh empowering end

2553
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,880
user is something great but my bigger

2554
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,600
concern is what if what if let's say

2555
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:22,880
there's a phishing attack and an

2556
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,199
attacker shows me and resolver identity

2557
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:27,040
which looks and feels like it's provided

2558
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,600
by let's say comcast right and and that

2559
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:31,679
would basically you know the end user

2560
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,159
would be assuming it's connecting to a

2561
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,880
comcast isp resolver and uh uh but in

2562
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,679
fact connecting to an uh phishing uh or

2563
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:43,199
a malicious dns encrypted dns resolver

2564
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,560
and

2565
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,239
how do you plan to address these issues

2566
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:50,960
thanks to um that's a lot of different

2567
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,199
things i'm not sure that um that i can

2568
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,880
track them all and respond to all those

2569
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:58,239
points um i'll try the

2570
01:42:58,239 --> 01:43:01,280
um on the topic of upgradeability um i

2571
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,880
think there's a lot of subtlety there

2572
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,000
there's

2573
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,360
uh

2574
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:08,320
for example it may be possible to

2575
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,880
change the configuration of certain

2576
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,199
routers but not really add major new

2577
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:16,080
features like tls termination

2578
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,800
so uh probably they can't we can just uh

2579
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:21,119
expect routers to just add support for

2580
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,239
tls

2581
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,000
um that would leave the you know the

2582
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,600
only thing that they could

2583
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:28,400
do would be to synthesize a

2584
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,360
a null and you know an nx domain or a no

2585
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,320
data

2586
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:35,280
ddr response which doesn't help

2587
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:36,840
so

2588
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:41,760
uh let's see um on the topic of

2589
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:42,639
um

2590
01:43:42,639 --> 01:43:44,320
of user

2591
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,880
interactive mitigations

2592
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,960
uh i think you know as i said this draft

2593
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,239
is informational it's not designed to

2594
01:43:52,239 --> 01:43:54,880
recommend particular behaviors here um

2595
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,719
if you think there's a concern

2596
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,080
you know some of these mitigations are

2597
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,360
really

2598
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:02,080
essentially impractical or irrelevant we

2599
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:04,239
could remove them but

2600
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:05,520
otherwise that we're just trying to be

2601
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,119
descriptive here

2602
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:08,159
the

2603
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:10,480
i do think that the attack you describe

2604
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,560
is not something that seriously concerns

2605
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:14,639
me because any attacker who's in a

2606
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:16,000
position to do

2607
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,239
anything like that

2608
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:20,480
would uh equally be in a position to

2609
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,080
simply prevent ddr altogether

2610
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,159
uh leaving the user sending their dns

2611
01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:27,679
and clear text and leaving the attacker

2612
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,000
in full control of the dns stream

2613
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,119
so

2614
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:31,920
uh

2615
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,119
in general you know clients shouldn't

2616
01:44:35,119 --> 01:44:37,840
if if the client is encrypting their

2617
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:38,800
their

2618
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:42,400
dns traffic and sending it to

2619
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:43,280
a

2620
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:45,600
dns server that they can identify but

2621
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,840
don't know anything about that shouldn't

2622
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,440
change the client

2623
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,199
or user agent's

2624
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,119
threat posture in any way they still

2625
01:44:53,119 --> 01:44:54,400
don't know whether they're talking to

2626
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,800
the attacker so

2627
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,840
uh so i don't see a big difference there

2628
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:02,080
sure

2629
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,400
uh i would like to have a question about

2630
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,560
the this private ip

2631
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,440
thing

2632
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,880
for

2633
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,159
changing the policy of the client

2634
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:20,639
uh how this would actually work with the

2635
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:23,600
v6 when there is no typical private

2636
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,960
address uh

2637
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,480
there

2638
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,400
shouldn't be is there some kind of

2639
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:33,280
policy of matching uh prefixes or uh

2640
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,920
something like this also with the

2641
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,639
private ipv4 address i suppose that it

2642
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,840
would uh it's referring to fresno

2643
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,600
dns uh resolver uh

2644
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,920
not uh when the

2645
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,199
resolver has a

2646
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,360
public ip address

2647
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:58,119
and the forwarding server does not

2648
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,080
hi

2649
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,159
uh

2650
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,320
i'm i'm sorry my i actually lost

2651
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
connection for a couple seconds while

2652
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,600
you were speaking

2653
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,840
um but let me i think i can answer your

2654
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,920
question but if i get it wrong maybe you

2655
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:12,719
can

2656
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,400
repeat some

2657
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,920
the

2658
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,679
so the this draft

2659
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:18,560
um

2660
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,719
the concept in this draft

2661
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,400
it describes cases where the the dns

2662
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:27,679
the local dns forwarder is identified by

2663
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:30,159
a non-public ip address

2664
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:33,440
that is obviously very common in ipv4

2665
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:35,440
networks

2666
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,159
it is definitely somewhat less common in

2667
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,880
ipv6 networks it is not ruled out in

2668
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,920
ipv6 networks ipv6 gateways that are

2669
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:47,360
operating forwarder are free to use a a

2670
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,800
local ip address a link local or whether

2671
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,119
there's a few different ipv6 non-public

2672
01:46:53,119 --> 01:46:57,760
ranges um there's and i believe that's

2673
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,280
well supported um relatively common

2674
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,880
so

2675
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,159
uh

2676
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:06,080
so that's always an option

2677
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:06,960
um

2678
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:09,760
otherwise the recommendations or sorry

2679
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,080
they're not recommendations it's it's uh

2680
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,920
you know it walks it it's a little

2681
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:15,840
delicate but the

2682
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,000
um

2683
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,639
the the situation where this applies

2684
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,159
is

2685
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:22,450
um

2686
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:23,679
[Music]

2687
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:25,280
is logically

2688
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,600
applicable to each

2689
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,719
advertised dns server independently that

2690
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:31,520
is

2691
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,800
ddr applies to each server separately

2692
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,159
rather than to the collection of

2693
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,400
advertised servers so on dual stack

2694
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:39,440
networks

2695
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,800
um this will apply to the ipv4 resolvers

2696
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,199
even if somehow some of the resolvers

2697
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:48,480
like ipv6 lovers are not eligible

2698
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,080
and then again it's a matter of client

2699
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,800
policy to figure out well i have

2700
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:54,560
several different resolvers i was able

2701
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,560
to do ddr for some of them but not

2702
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,040
others you know does that how does that

2703
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,159
influence the way i send queries

2704
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:03,840
okay thank you very much and i do have

2705
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:07,360
also uh one point to ddr itself

2706
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,600
i know it's probably a little bit too

2707
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,560
late uh but uh

2708
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:15,080
why the ddr itself uses the

2709
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,040
resolver.arpa when

2710
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:18,000
there was

2711
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,520
probably the pvd that would allow to use

2712
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:24,239
something like underscore resolver dot

2713
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,920
pvd

2714
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:28,480
domain this would allow a dns uh

2715
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,880
validation of this information

2716
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,280
and also

2717
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,639
ddr seems to solve uh the detection of

2718
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:38,080
doh

2719
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:39,199
problem

2720
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,440
with the path uh wouldn't be

2721
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:44,840
better to update rfc

2722
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,719
8484 to reso to limit the path to

2723
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:52,080
something like uh uniform d

2724
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:56,159
url url sorry uh

2725
01:48:56,159 --> 01:49:00,800
uh also i've seen in ddr draft

2726
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,960
dot with a different port

2727
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,080
is it wise to allow different port and

2728
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,000
ddr

2729
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,320
thank you very much

2730
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,679
so the

2731
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:15,360
for the path and port comments you might

2732
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:18,320
want to uh you might want to

2733
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,040
take those to the the comments on the

2734
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:23,679
the service bdns draft which the chairs

2735
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,840
just closed the last call on but that's

2736
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:28,960
that's where those are specified um

2737
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,599
i can i can speak to those

2738
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,560
topics but um maybe the chairs should

2739
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:37,679
should tell me how much time we have

2740
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,280
we actually have enough time but we do

2741
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:42,880
have two more people in the queue so

2742
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,480
um okay so so briefly i'll say that i i

2743
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:49,840
think the path component issue is

2744
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:52,800
um is fundamentally there because do

2745
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,040
was was already specified and widely

2746
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:58,639
deployed with uh with path components

2747
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:02,159
so there are um many dns many doe

2748
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,239
resolvers already out there

2749
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,159
that that have a

2750
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,400
specified path

2751
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,440
and

2752
01:50:09,440 --> 01:50:10,880
and we wanted to make sure that it was

2753
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,000
possible to

2754
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,280
uh

2755
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,679
to to specify those dom servers in the

2756
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,320
in in the ddr context

2757
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:27,040
um for the port number um

2758
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,800
the

2759
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:33,199
the port number specification is uh

2760
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,199
is something that

2761
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:38,239
is it is optional for clients so and

2762
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,320
it's up to every client to decide

2763
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,440
whether they support this

2764
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,679
but it's

2765
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:48,400
it's especially useful when

2766
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:51,040
running many different servers on the

2767
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,320
services that need to be disambiguated

2768
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,239
instead of you know if you're trying to

2769
01:50:56,239 --> 01:50:58,560
for example run

2770
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,280
dns servers with different behaviors

2771
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,800
you can share an ip address and run them

2772
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:04,840
on different port numbers

2773
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,960
uh and uh it's also helpful in

2774
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:12,000
in other contexts related to dns

2775
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,280
um

2776
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,280
where where non-standard port numbers

2777
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,199
are an issue

2778
01:51:17,199 --> 01:51:19,599
but uh maybe we should talk more about

2779
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:20,400
that

2780
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,960
yeah i think um at this point uh we are

2781
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,159
getting near the end of the session and

2782
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:25,520
i'd like to get tommy and eric in the

2783
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,000
queue so thank you martin

2784
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,400
and please continue on the list or as

2785
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:32,880
necessary out of band thank you tommy

2786
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,840
please

2787
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:40,960
let's see

2788
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:41,840
okay

2789
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,199
um

2790
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,760
yeah i agree with ben's points to this

2791
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,520
last question so we can help explain

2792
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:48,719
what's there but i don't think those

2793
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,000
aspects are going to change i think

2794
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:51,520
those are the right calls

2795
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,639
um so ben on your

2796
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:55,840
draft

2797
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:58,080
um

2798
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:00,800
i i appreciate that it's not

2799
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:02,560
normative

2800
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,679
but i'm wondering if in section three

2801
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,480
that defines this relaxed validation

2802
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,840
policy

2803
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:11,760
we may want to be

2804
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:13,760
a bit more prescriptive not necessarily

2805
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:16,320
normative but it essentially just says

2806
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,560
it defines the client policy as

2807
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,800
you just use opportunistic and you just

2808
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,040
try it and it points to

2809
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,159
that the fact that this kind of

2810
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:28,480
validation can be valuable

2811
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,080
when combined with some of the

2812
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:31,360
mitigations

2813
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,280
but i wonder if we should have a bit

2814
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,000
stronger of a recommendation

2815
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,159
to say that no really you need to go and

2816
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,480
read the security considerations blow

2817
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:41,520
and you need to think about the

2818
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,040
mitigations

2819
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,480
i'm just a bit concerned someone would

2820
01:52:44,480 --> 01:52:46,800
read it and say well look they've

2821
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:48,960
defined a policy where i can just

2822
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,800
use whatever i get back from this dns

2823
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,360
record willy-nilly

2824
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,800
and i don't think that's we should

2825
01:52:54,800 --> 01:52:56,239
indicate that that would not be a good

2826
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:59,440
idea even if we don't make it normative

2827
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,679
yeah it's a little unclear to me whether

2828
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,280
normative language is allowed in

2829
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:04,639
informational

2830
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,119
documents i'm not suggesting making it

2831
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:09,599
normative necessarily we just say like

2832
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:10,560
you would

2833
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,800
have a bad privacy time

2834
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,159
and yeah you'd be probably making a

2835
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,360
wrong decision if you don't have a

2836
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:17,119
mitigation

2837
01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:18,080
right

2838
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:21,280
uh speaking with only a partial hair a

2839
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,080
hat on i will say um that

2840
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,560
i personally am in favor of it however

2841
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,960
when i've tried to do it i've also been

2842
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:31,280
pointed out by other people in the itf

2843
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,520
that not so fast so

2844
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,320
it is an unresolved point

2845
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:40,320
okay um i i think that that we can take

2846
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,320
we can definitely incorporate tommy's

2847
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:45,599
feedback here and improve the

2848
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:47,119
the you know

2849
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,320
warning about sharp edges

2850
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:53,320
eric

2851
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,159
um uh eric you

2852
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:03,679
have the mic but you might be muted

2853
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:06,679
locally

2854
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,440
uh eric please come back

2855
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:20,000
eric nygren is back okay yes um now

2856
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,239
unmute yourself

2857
01:54:22,239 --> 01:54:24,320
there he is oh what's going on there

2858
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,639
eric

2859
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,840
well maybe it's time for jabber

2860
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,520
yeah permissions issues he's having so

2861
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,840
um

2862
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,400
was it going to be your question

2863
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,840
no probably not oh he just went

2864
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,199
offline he may be back in a second so

2865
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:52,639
why don't we give him a second to join

2866
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,080
by does anybody else want to jump into

2867
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,440
the queue while we wait for eric to

2868
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:58,000
return nope we're not accepting anybody

2869
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,440
else in the queue glenn

2870
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:01,199
oh it looks like eric is going to work

2871
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,040
this time

2872
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,560
yes we hear you

2873
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:05,599
whoo

2874
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:07,119
um i

2875
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:09,119
that um following up on some of the

2876
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,960
conversation in the chat i think it's

2877
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,199
worth looking into the ipv6 side of this

2878
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,239
a little more

2879
01:55:14,239 --> 01:55:16,239
um in particular

2880
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:18,800
i'm doing some more review of what's

2881
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,719
actually and what what's used in

2882
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:23,040
practice here um there may be a lot of

2883
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:26,000
it seems likely that that a a common use

2884
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,840
case will be for

2885
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:28,800
um

2886
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,719
um to use the

2887
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,480
um like this is the gateway address

2888
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,560
which would be a or a public or a public

2889
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,360
address in the same 64 as a client as

2890
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,599
the resolver and if that's a very very

2891
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:41,599
common scenario it may be worth having

2892
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:42,719
some

2893
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,560
guidance around those common ipv6

2894
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:47,360
scenarios so we don't get um

2895
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,560
stuck there or not work in in some of

2896
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,119
the the commonly deployed ipv6 only

2897
01:55:53,119 --> 01:55:54,320
networks

2898
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:58,000
hopefully not the same 64.

2899
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,400
no the a very common case would be the

2900
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,000
same squash 64 it's a client

2901
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:07,440
huh that's definitely not in keeping

2902
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:12,799
with the ipv6 group guidance for

2903
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,080
isps i think this is one where where

2904
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,920
it's worth looking at it it's worth

2905
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:18,880
looking at

2906
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:21,280
what which what a client support and

2907
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:22,400
what do

2908
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,360
um and what are isps tend um tend to

2909
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:28,320
deploy and then based upon that seeing

2910
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,080
what to use

2911
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,119
i

2912
01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:33,760
i think that we have um there we have

2913
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,000
kind of a more fundamental

2914
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,360
problem

2915
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,360
um of trying to

2916
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,360
trying to figure out

2917
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,800
what

2918
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,320
what it would mean

2919
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:44,630
to

2920
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:46,000
[Music]

2921
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,400
essentially validate the locality of a

2922
01:56:48,400 --> 01:56:51,380
public address

2923
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:52,639
[Music]

2924
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:54,639
you know if i have a dns server

2925
01:56:54,639 --> 01:56:57,679
identified by a public ip address ddrs

2926
01:56:57,679 --> 01:56:59,920
baseline logic says well it's a public

2927
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,159
ip address they could get a certificate

2928
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:05,599
to prove control of it

2929
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:07,360
and essentially the

2930
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:09,119
the the questions that we end up with

2931
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:11,119
here are things like well how do

2932
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:13,599
what if i could prove that i'm so close

2933
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:16,080
to this address that i'm just as good a

2934
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:19,760
judge of its authenticity as anybody

2935
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:20,960
um

2936
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,719
you know and so we've had we've had

2937
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,880
suggestions on the list for example

2938
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:27,440
about like well could use the hop count

2939
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,400
could you you know set your set your ttl

2940
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:33,760
to 2 and ping it and see if you can

2941
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,960
reach it

2942
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,239
uh and then you know that's close enough

2943
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:39,280
uh

2944
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:40,800
i think we've

2945
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,960
we haven't seen any of those that seem

2946
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:45,119
i think plausible enough that that they

2947
01:57:45,119 --> 01:57:47,280
would be deployable so my my question to

2948
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,599
flip your question around would be okay

2949
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:51,199
that's you know the common deployment

2950
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:53,280
practice uh

2951
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,840
maybe is is to use a public ip address

2952
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:58,239
there but how hard would it be to just

2953
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:00,480
uh you know also drop a

2954
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,440
a link local address into the dhcp or

2955
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:05,520
into the ipv6 ra

2956
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,400
rd well the link localism um introduces

2957
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,040
a whole bunch of scope issues that

2958
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,480
i think there's a question on how will

2959
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,760
clients

2960
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,719
support

2961
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:17,360
those and it's unclear what the

2962
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,719
the security

2963
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:20,480
property how the security properties

2964
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:22,000
between a

2965
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,760
a link local versus a on link in the

2966
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:29,280
same 64 differ

2967
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,040
uh yeah so well there's a difference

2968
01:58:33,040 --> 01:58:34,719
between

2969
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:36,320
um

2970
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:37,679
there's a difference between link local

2971
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:39,599
and onlink right

2972
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:40,560
um

2973
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:42,080
you know depending on how your network

2974
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:44,000
is structured

2975
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,320
uh you know the the router's ip address

2976
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,199
might not actually be in the same

2977
01:58:49,199 --> 01:58:50,239
like

2978
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:53,599
you know neighbor discovery collision

2979
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,280
segment as as the client or whatever

2980
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,159
um

2981
01:58:58,159 --> 01:59:00,960
but uh anyway i think

2982
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,960
this is certainly if if we can find

2983
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:04,800
reasonable ideas here this is definitely

2984
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,320
something that we can incorporate

2985
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,560
great thank you eric and thank you ben

2986
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:13,119
over to you glenn for the wrap up

2987
01:59:13,119 --> 01:59:17,040
yeah hi everybody so um great great

2988
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,400
session um today uh add is always a

2989
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,320
place where people talk and exchange

2990
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,719
ideas and it's been pretty awesome

2991
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:26,960
i want to say you know

2992
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,040
reflecting just for a second

2993
01:59:29,040 --> 01:59:31,280
we started out as and i can't remember

2994
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,599
if we've ever actually met in person for

2995
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:35,760
add i remember we had several boss

2996
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,840
before we went live

2997
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,400
but i kind of think we did all of the

2998
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:41,920
last two years

2999
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,719
and

3000
01:59:42,719 --> 01:59:45,040
all these drafts all virtual

3001
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,480
and so i just kind of want to thank the

3002
01:59:46,480 --> 01:59:48,080
authors and all the commenters and

3003
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:49,760
