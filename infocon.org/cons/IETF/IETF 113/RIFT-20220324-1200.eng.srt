1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,480
you so we only have a short agenda today

2
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,760
um so we uh just wait for a couple more

3
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,199
minutes before we get started

4
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,480
okay

5
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
uh hi everyone welcome to atf 113 reef

6
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,959
working group meeting

7
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,560
uh it's going to be reasonably short

8
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,959
meeting we've got two presentations

9
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,760
uh

10
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
so at least

11
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
by now you should know not well describe

12
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
how your input and participation atf is

13
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,200
treated please read it if you haven't

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,518
before

15
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
meeting tips uh

16
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
you could

17
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,280
join on site please do so so we know

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
you've been present and your name will

19
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,480
show up on blue

20
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,280
and please keep your audience video of

21
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,239
unless you're presenting

22
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,480
so those are the links to agenda and

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,359
other information

24
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
and agenda for today we are going to

25
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,480
quickly update you what's going on and

26
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
then uh we have two presentations from

27
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,080
jordan

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,599
on uh

29
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,359
this author and auto vpn

30
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
so where we are

31
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
within working group the

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,239
uh base pack has been updated a couple

33
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
of times thanks alvaro for reviewing

34
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,480
softly with tony so

35
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,599
uh

36
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,040
it's spending

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
new review

38
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,040
applicability statement spending alvarez

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,239
reviews

40
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,200
uh young model working group isn't

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
process the

42
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
data model is in good shape

43
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
so we expect to finish after atf same

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,920
goes for the kv registry

45
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
work on out evpns and progress you know

46
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,199
there's implementation segment routing

47
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,000
is in process multicast we are not going

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
to update it i mean we are going to

49
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
update it but not to work on it for

50
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
some time in the future when there's

51
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
more demand probably we'll start

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,639
updating it again with more details

53
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,440
and jordan

54
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
yeah get situated or if you guys want to

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
share yeah that works okay

56
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,919
uh let me get situated

57
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
okay um

58
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
all right so first off thanks chairs

59
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
thanks for the time today um so the deck

60
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,600
being proposed today is

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,039
uh we're taking advantage of riffs

62
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,120
architecture to automatically build

63
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
flood reflections apologies but i i want

64
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
to spend a few minutes and just give

65
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
some kind of quick context about

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,400
you know the problem we're actually

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
trying to solve with flood reflection i

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
think it helps

69
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,639
make everything with what we're doing

70
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
with rift make a bit more sense

71
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,600
uh next slide please

72
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,360
so

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
um let's define the problem so we all

74
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,880
know that

75
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,280
flat single area igps come with some

76
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
pitfalls and so

77
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,720
flooding and that every node needs to

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
know everything state and that every

79
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
node needs to maintain

80
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
and convergence and that every node

81
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
needs to compute so this gets even worse

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
as the network is scaled

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
you know but these sorts of deployments

84
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
are you know pretty desirable um you

85
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,479
know sr is a good example of that

86
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,199
next slide please

87
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
so let's visualize it a little bit more

88
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
right so

89
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
this is just a relatively small flat

90
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
level two isis network a single flooding

91
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,199
domain

92
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
as this network grows and grows scale

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
starts to become a concern and

94
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,479
you know kind of uh going over what we

95
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,400
just said right there's lots of state

96
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
you know each node has to maintain it

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,160
all both in terms of

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,039
adjacencies and link state database

99
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,720
there's more and more flooding it has to

100
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
distribute more lspdus to all the nodes

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
and you know lastly slower convergence

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
that link state information is then

103
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
computed against spf and this just

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
compounds as it grows

105
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,520
uh next slide please

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
uh so what's the solution um

107
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
isis flood reflection it's based on

108
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,280
existing work in lsr um

109
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,479
you know i'd encourage you to check out

110
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,319
the draft if you're interested um it's

111
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
pretty short pretty easy um but

112
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,520
in short it basically works a little bit

113
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,440
like bgp route reflection and you know

114
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,919
we choose a cluster id and we designate

115
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,599
one or more flood reflectors we

116
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,039
designate one or more flood reflective

117
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,319
clients

118
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
and we get some pretty desirable

119
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,080
properties uh next slide

120
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
so basically we take the

121
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
you know previously flat level two

122
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,240
network and we split into multiple

123
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,199
flooding domains so we have l1 l2 nodes

124
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
that are

125
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,880
establishing flood reflector adjacencies

126
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
inside level two

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
and

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,680
uh you know the flood reflectors

129
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
themselves will sit at the top

130
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
and the flood reflector clients will sit

131
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,360
down at the bottom you know leads that

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
are also split into

133
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,360
l1 l2 nodes so basically we can leak l2

134
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,879
routes from

135
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,680
uh the leaves you know tier one into

136
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
level one um there are other methods as

137
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,639
well

138
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,919
kind of tunnel these deployments that

139
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,039
are detailed a little bit more in the

140
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,560
lsr draft but

141
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,800
um the point here is that l1 and l2

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
converge independently of one another

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
thus solving a lot of the problems uh

144
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,878
next slide please

145
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,199
so just kind of a quick before and after

146
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,960
um just for those who are visually

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,319
inclined

148
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
we can kind of see the difference there

149
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,520
with those those dotted lines on the

150
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
right being the flood reflector

151
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
adjacencies between the uh

152
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,639
the nodes participating in level two

153
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,599
next slide please

154
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
and so a little bit of i guess metrics

155
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
again scale so considering our topology

156
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,360
shown here um you know without flood

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,640
reflection

158
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,679
it's roughly 15 adjacencies um

159
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,839
but with flood reflection we reduce it

160
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,958
down to eight

161
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,559
and obviously with that we have other

162
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
other components as well next slide

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
please

164
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,399
and you know the other factors right

165
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,720
less links and less adjacencies means we

166
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
get less you know link state pdus

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
less link state pds means less flooding

168
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,880
and both of those mean less spf

169
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,279
computation overall so ultimately you

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,040
know it's pretty clear improvement scale

171
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
wise um

172
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,199
with flood reflection but uh next slide

173
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,480
and what's what's that got to do with

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
rift so

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,080
flood reflection like rift is pretty

176
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,480
well suited for plot topologies so

177
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,320
basically um for those familiar with

178
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,959
auto evpn it's pretty similar context

179
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,720
but for those that aren't we riff will

180
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,399
build the you know underlay quote

181
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
unquote uh and then we'll use autofr to

182
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
actually build the flood reflection

183
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,760
topologies on top of that um so

184
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,880
we do that by automatically deriving um

185
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
variables important to flood reflection

186
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
like i said this is the cluster id

187
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,760
um and you know loopback address um

188
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,720
actually next slide please sorry

189
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
yeah so you know we have flood reflector

190
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
the cluster id you know loopback address

191
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
all the information relevant to isis and

192
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,519
they can be computed

193
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
you know it's distributed computation

194
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
each node can figure it out on its own

195
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
and you know we can build those

196
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
topologies pretty simply next slide

197
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,519
please

198
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,279
so this is just one example of what some

199
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,040
of that derivation looks like

200
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
there are other functions in the draft

201
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,519
that are outlined pretty clearly um

202
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
and

203
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
yeah i just kind of encourage you to

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,839
take a look at i just want to give you a

205
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,120
rough look

206
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,920
and on also too there are auto fr

207
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,079
analytics so we use um

208
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,319
look like the share drops

209
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,240
let's give it a sec here we're almost

210
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,720
done anyway

211
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,480
um slide 12.

212
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,560
yeah so we have auto fr analytics so

213
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,519
um

214
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,120
jeff mentioned that that key value

215
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,480
registry that's going through working

216
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,959
group last call basically we use um

217
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,839
those

218
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
key value ties the link state

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
information and rif to distribute

220
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,560
operational information about auto fr so

221
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
rather than having to look in at every

222
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
node in the network you can just go look

223
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
at the top of fabric nodes that would be

224
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
participating as flood reflectors and

225
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,839
you can see you know a rough general

226
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,680
state of everything you know helps in

227
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,640
things like troubleshooting

228
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
uh and next slide

229
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,680
that's it so what's next right now you

230
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,079
know first first pass so i'm interested

231
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,519
in feedback co-authorship anything um

232
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,880
and some more

233
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,560
you know operational considerations and

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
examples as well and uh

235
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
yeah that's it any any questions

236
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,959
so i actually have a question um is it

237
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
that

238
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,800
this applies to a

239
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,639
class networks but uh um

240
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,639
in situations where a cust an operator

241
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,079
choose not to run on rift but

242
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,200
wrong iss instead but still we can use

243
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,800
the rifts uh some reef procedure to

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,680
to help the flood reduction in isis

245
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,839
i might let tony take it if he doesn't

246
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,680
mind with the implementation side i

247
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,240
haven't thought through that

248
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
particular component i was on the chat

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,839
what was the question jeffrey

250
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
so i just want to confirm my

251
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,279
understanding that

252
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
the scenario here is that you have a

253
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,360
class network

254
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
but you are not running the rift

255
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,320
protocol for the

256
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
link states or or route

257
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
route calculation

258
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
and you're running isrs but you're using

259
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,880
the some riffs uh underlying um

260
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,360
protocol procedures to to to help with

261
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
the iss flood reduction

262
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,279
uh yes and no um

263
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,360
can we flip back to the topology picture

264
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
yeah all right so now

265
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
if you uh take it uh towards the isis

266
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
direction completely then yes rift is

267
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,519
kind of only ztp if you want okay and

268
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,279
then it configures l1 and l2 isis and

269
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,120
everything is isis and at this point in

270
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,160
time rift is kind of just hanging there

271
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,639
for uh you know the

272
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
club topology and being

273
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,720
figuring out who has withdrawal on the

274
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,079
topology

275
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,560
but you can just as well not configure

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,599
l1 and use rift to forward packets

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,320
right so you also have this option

278
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,880
um depending which flavor you prefer

279
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
there's classes and minuses to both

280
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
um

281
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
uh

282
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,560
that kind of goes deep flood reflector

283
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,959
has two flavors it you can either build

284
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,040
a full mesh of tunnels between the l

285
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
ones

286
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,720
uh the leaves or you can run it without

287
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,560
tunnels where you're basically leaking

288
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,519
from l2 into l1 you can lick from l2

289
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,440
into rift just fine

290
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
if your implementation supports that and

291
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
then red does the stuff

292
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,440
if you run tunnels it depends how you

293
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,040
configure it if you configure the

294
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,959
tunnels

295
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,360
somehow manually between the leaves you

296
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,639
can run rift

297
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
but the flat reflector in l1

298
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
is also flooding in isis the rolls and

299
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
the tunnel end point so that allows you

300
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,720
to basically

301
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
configure the mesh of tunnels fully

302
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
automatically

303
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,440
so it's kind of

304
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,320
you know

305
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,839
your choice you could run the rift for

306
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,720
l1 but

307
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
the way i think we wrote the draft and

308
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,839
and the more natural choice is to

309
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
configure both l1 and l2 and then get

310
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
all your

311
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,839
um

312
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
uh stuff

313
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,199
well

314
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,920
uh no actually you need l1 if you really

315
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,120
want the l1 tunnel discovery and i'm not

316
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,480
talking about the tunnels the flat

317
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,639
reflector tunnels the the little dotted

318
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,320
lines here i'm talking really about full

319
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
mesh between the leaves which is a

320
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,839
flavor

321
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,160
of flood reflector used to forwarding

322
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,839
because the leaf stuff uh sorry the the

323
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,360
flood reflection tunnels the dotted

324
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,839
tunnels which are only used for flooding

325
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
this stuff you already have with rift

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
you can automatically configure them

327
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,759
what you just said we are using rift as

328
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,600
gtp technology for iss here right

329
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,480
all right

330
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,839
asks again

331
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,160
what is the scope here well so bruno the

332
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,639
scope is here that rift is used as ztp

333
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
to bring up a claw and then

334
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
configure give you everything to

335
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,240
configure isis flood reflection

336
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
automatically on top of that

337
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,320
but there is a flavor that rift could be

338
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,399
also the l1 protocol and then you don't

339
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
need isis l1

340
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,279
so i would think it would require

341
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,720
charter extensions

342
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,040
alvaro

343
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,480
yeah so

344
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
using riff as a

345
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,839
non-routing protocol but something else

346
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
is not in scope today and uh i'm looking

347
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,519
at alberta and his comments and

348
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
uh hi i'm laura thank you

349
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,600
i wasn't exactly gonna say that but but

350
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
you're right uh what i was gonna say or

351
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
what i was gonna ask is whether you had

352
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,240
talked about this in lsr

353
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,639
um at least you should right because you

354
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,040
know there's a close relationship with

355
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,000
between this work and the flood

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,880
reflection draft there

357
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
um

358
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
and also the other observations i was

359
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,439
going to make is that

360
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,880
the flow refraction draft seems to be

361
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,280
experimental in lsr

362
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,720
so if

363
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
and as this goes forward we would want

364
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,079
to you know keep an eye on that as well

365
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,760
all right so i think auto evpn have been

366
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,679
shown in ibr it's a good suggestion to

367
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,839
get um

368
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,010
let me put it on my action item list um

369
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,240
[Music]

370
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,799
so it's a good suggestion to actually uh

371
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
show that in lsr

372
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
uh yes

373
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,120
not reflection experimental um i mean

374
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
not i don't know which track this draft

375
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
has been suggested for i mean i'm kind

376
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
of okay with anything informational

377
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,640
experimental

378
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,400
uh so you know

379
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
we would like to have this thing at

380
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
least experimental because people can

381
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
interrupt that stuff

382
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,280
this is beyond just all that what you

383
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
can do everybody have to derive with

384
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
values based on the risk of apology the

385
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,280
same way for the whole thing to work

386
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,320
with kind of needs interoperability

387
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,080
so my action item is to actually somehow

388
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
hopefully ls aren't presented yeah we'll

389
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,480
do that thank you

390
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
uh alvaro with regards to charter

391
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,280
do we need to extend charter explicitly

392
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
to allow work on

393
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,799
this kind of scenarios uh yes uh so yes

394
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,559
i agree with you that that i mean right

395
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,799
now we're chartered to do a routing

396
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,880
protocol

397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,559
even if the same protocol is going to be

398
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,679
used for

399
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,520
um

400
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,919
discovery auto configuration whatever we

401
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
want to call this um yeah we probably

402
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,039
need to to reach harder

403
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
and of the charters

404
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,200
in lsr i'm cancelling calls the drought

405
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
there and we'll be talking about that

406
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,360
any questions here from anyone

407
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,600
out avp and drops

408
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
now slides are coming

409
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
jordan

410
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,280
none of the stuff comes up is basically

411
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
you know we board and we have nothing

412
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
left to do

413
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,480
actually customer posting us like asking

414
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
or could you do something like that

415
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,080
which the first answer would know

416
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,760
and then after we thought about it more

417
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,360
it will figure out actually yes it works

418
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
yep sorry okay i was just making sure no

419
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,120
one else had comments

420
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,400
one there okay um pretty brief update

421
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,760
with this one

422
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
um

423
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
if we could just jump to the next slide

424
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
for me

425
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
once i can find my deck okay

426
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
okay um

427
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,720
so

428
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
just

429
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
i'm sorry looking at the wrong side of

430
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,280
it

431
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,280
bear with me

432
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,520
okay sorry about that

433
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
um

434
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
okay just a couple of updates on auto

435
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,159
evpn nothing nothing too big this time

436
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,480
next slide please

437
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
oh no that one's good i'm sorry

438
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,799
backup one

439
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,000
thanks okay so uh the the main changes

440
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
here are

441
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
um you know improved so to speak

442
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
variable derivation for some of the

443
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,919
numbering things like irbe vlan and the

444
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,960
evi values um big thanks to olivier for

445
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
that um and some

446
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,960
through schema changes just move stuff

447
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
around and make things a little bit more

448
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,520
simple with regard to um

449
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,880
advertising the node's capability and

450
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
some of the specific

451
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,000
variables

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
within the fabric

453
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,000
inside riff rather than just inside

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
auto evpn

455
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,799
exclusively next

456
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
slide so just to give a rough example so

457
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,039
previously some of the results would

458
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
look like this um the main thing to

459
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
point out would be you know like the

460
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,880
vlan id and the irb are

461
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
not identical values um a couple it

462
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,640
works perfectly well but some of the

463
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,760
operators

464
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,280
preferred that

465
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,200
the irb and the vlan would be matched to

466
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
keep things kind of you know simple

467
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
align with their existing deployment

468
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
practices

469
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,120
and if we jump to the next slide

470
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,640
um

471
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,039
basically improved it before uh

472
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,720
tony did some work with the hash

473
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,880
computer the

474
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
computation functions and was basically

475
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,640
able to get things to line up

476
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,799
um without you know any scale reduction

477
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,039
or anything like that so uh makes

478
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,799
operators happy and makes you know

479
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,120
verification troubleshooting easier

480
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,320
honestly in my opinion too

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
next slide

482
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,280
just

483
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,960
uh there are a couple other things but

484
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,039
these are the important ones

485
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,799
basically the

486
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,120
main rift

487
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,240
thrift schemas carry

488
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
the fabric id components you know the

489
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
default fabric id and

490
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,799
undefined as well and then the encoding

491
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,799
piece the node capabilities and the

492
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
flags now carry um

493
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,080
auto evpn and uh

494
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
whether that node supports it or not the

495
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,880
node flags will carry you know if

496
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
there's a data center interconnect

497
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
functionality required

498
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,760
for auto evpn

499
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
and last slide

500
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,039
um

501
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,280
that's really it but what's next is you

502
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,080
know

503
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,000
again co-authorship comments more as

504
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,960
well are welcome and we're still working

505
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,039
toward more multi-plane and data center

506
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,000
interconnect examples and then um some

507
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,520
operational stuff that fell off the

508
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
radar a little bit this time

509
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,000
but any any questions regard to that

510
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,000
okay that's that's all i had

511
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,200
okay

512
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,039

update the draft um but it was pretty

520

complete and stable from the author's

521
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
point of view already

522
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,039
