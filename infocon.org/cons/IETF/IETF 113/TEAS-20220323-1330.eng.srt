1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,559
okay things now works i guess

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
okay that's great

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,480
yeah okay

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
uh just we need to show the note well

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
and then we're gonna start

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,960
uh we'll just run it the same way we did

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,359
before

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,920
okay welcome back

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,120
um

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,160
uh

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
to the second and final t session in

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
vienna our hybrid meeting um i'm lou

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
berger we have my co-chair

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
uh pavan biram online as well as our

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,960
secretary luis contreras in the room

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,760
um

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
this is the same

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,879
notewell that we showed before and

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
i think everyone is familiar with it and

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
with that i'm going to yield the floor

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,680
uh to

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,640
uh

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,280
the tallow

24
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
hello hi hi everybody i'm interrupted

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,920
i'm presenting on behalf of code can you

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,360
hear me

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
yes you sound good

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
okay okay i'm presenting on behalf of

29
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
propose updates to the common the types

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
so

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
what is the objective of this document

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,720
is to add uh to do some minor tiny

33
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,759
update

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,560
to the existing itft type modules which

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
is published in rfc878676

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,159
this update is is very small and

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,399
backward compatible with what has been

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,600
already defined

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
the fact that we need to create to add a

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
new type def and in the new grouping

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
with two leaves

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,399
and we had

43
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,799
some processed issues to this guy which

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,520
discussed uh uh on monday on tuesday

45
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,920
yesterday with a networking group

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
because we are a little bit afraid there

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,479
is some reluctance on the on the visa

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,439
approach

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
reason is the document is quite long and

50
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,758
we just need to do a few changes some

51
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,599
very minor changes

52
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,040
and that

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,520
we in the a776 we have other rear

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
modules which do not need to be updated

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,800
and what we want to put into this draft

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,599
is very simple is a little things which

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
is very mature because it's just moving

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,560
things which are already funny in other

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,720
working group documents some of which

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
are actually now in the working group

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,879
that's called so we need to have a way

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,040
to be fast on progress in this document

63
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
if you want to make this entities

64
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,920
available to a broader applicability and

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
without blocking the progress of the

66
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
documents which are already mature

67
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,400
so what do we need

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
the technical content is basically a new

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
typedef which is called bandwidth

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
scientific notation to represent the

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,080
bandwidth

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,640
of of a packet link but also of a packet

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,879
lsp in a way that is um readable not

74
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,120
like floating 32 but is a scientific

75
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
notation numbers

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,959
this is already defined in a draft

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,480
itft's young lpt toppo however the

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,959
proposal is to move it in the t types

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,280
because this type def ever broader

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,040
applicability is not only limited to

81
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,920
packety topology can be used for example

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,040
by lsp or tunnels and also not limited

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,799
to packet technology we have recently

84
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,799
seen some cases of nonpacket technology

85
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,159
that may need

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
many to express the band will require

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,959
the bandwidth in in as a number in bit

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
per second and they could benefit

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,879
from this type def

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
and then we have a new grouping which is

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,319
called encoding the switching type which

92
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,239
contains the two leaves for encoding and

93
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
switching type this grouping was

94
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,640
initially defined in the pac computation

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
draft

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,879
by copying uh from

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,040
the tr model idft model trying to keep

98
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,959
alignment between the two models however

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,799
we discovered that

100
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
quickly we went out of sync so we agreed

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,000
to move this grouping in the t in the

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
itf young te import it in the in the

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,640
computation then we guarantee the

104
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,400
alignment between the two models but

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,360
again

106
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,799
this grouping may have a bigger

107
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,798
applicability than just

108
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
an empire computation so moving it to t

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,079
ties

110
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,798
we

111
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,440
will make it available to a broader

112
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
applications and make sure that

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
everybody has a common

114
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
approach to configure encoding a

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,919
switching type in younger

116
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,400
so we need just this one which is quite

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,919
a tiny update the process that we

118
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,160
propose is therefore not to go with

119
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,759
another c8776b but to have this document

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,000
updating the

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,479
rsc8776 with a new version of the 80

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
types only so the theta packet types

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
in the rsc 8776 will be remain unchanged

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,199
and will still be valid because

125
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,960
s76 is not obsoleted

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,600
and since the changes are quite small we

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
can have we can expect to have a fast uh

128
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
standardization to make not to delay the

129
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,479
work on layers into a topology on itft

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,600
and rtft computation the la the the last

131
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
two are the

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
dt is already in the in working room

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
quality computation is ready for working

134
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,240
group last call

135
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
so we will not like to to delay too much

136
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
if by moving the common part

137
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
on this rafter

138
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
we discussed the approach from the

139
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
process point of view and that more

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
gives the feedback that updating the rsc

141
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
is a viable option however the

142
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,400
suggestion we got is not to put the diff

143
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,440
into the main body but to put the whole

144
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,840
model into the main body and maybe to

145
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,840
mark with some comments to the rfc

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,639
editor what has been changed with

147
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
respect to the to the latest to the rsc

148
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,639
we and we will we plan to update the

149
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
document according to the suggestion

150
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,880
from that model

151
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,080
and then about uh the next steps uh then

152
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,840
okay was the first point was to get

153
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,160
feedbacks from working group and ads on

154
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,440
the process

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,919
and uh that we got last uh yesterday

156
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,240
that we have feedback from this group

157
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
from the teas on the technical comment

158
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
so even if this type definite grouping

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
are coming from natural working group

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
documents please review

161
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
and give us any comments and feedbacks

162
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
and if the proposed approach is accepted

163
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,800
we think the document is ready for

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,440
working group adoption hopefully soon we

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
will keep updating the draft based on

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,919
the comments from the working group and

167
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,400
we can align the working groups ideas

168
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
that depends on this document

169
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,919
according to the decision to move

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,759
forward on this direction

171
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,440
and either it would be great if you can

172
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,160
go last call together with the first

173
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
abandoned working group id not to give

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
too much delay

175
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,800
on the processor and

176
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
that's that's all about the content of

177
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
this draft

178
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,840
thank you thank you any comment or

179
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,240
question uh hi this is blue berger um so

180
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,479
i was in uh netbond uh we'll say

181
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
co-chair and i heard the comment to you

182
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
a little differently than you heard oh

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,240
okay sorry

184
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
uh what what i heard is is that there

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,280
are

186
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,680
two options really available

187
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
either

188
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,520
do uh abyss and change the whole model

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
that module excuse me

190
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,160
um and it's in particular do not do

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,880
anything any new tooling that's new

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,759
tooling is a bad idea

193
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,680
so that's option one

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,199
option two

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
is do a

196
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,400
a

197
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,919
document that contains only the change

198
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,800
and up as an update to the existing

199
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
document so no bis

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
just an update

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,599
and

202
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
that was proposed because i the way you

203
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,240
presented it is is that of the modules

204
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
that are in the base document you're

205
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
only updating one not the others

206
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
and so the update approach seemed to be

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,280
a better match

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,559
so that's what i heard

209
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
so we plan to continue with the update

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,199
and

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,199
and then we don't put the diff in the

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
main body by the julia model if

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
understood correctly

214
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
that's just the one module not all the

215
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
one module my module yes one module yes

216
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,960
yeah not

217
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,840
not all yeah now that you okay

218
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,519
great uh thank you maybe maybe i

219
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
misheard you this time and it wasn't you

220
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,279
who misheard but me who missed

221
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880

this document

232
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,279
it's a solution document for realizing

233
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,160
network slices and packet networks

234
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
um i'm giving this update on behalf of

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
today i will not dig deep into the

237
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
solution we presented that earlier i

238
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,279
will uh give a current status uh of

239
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
where the document stands uh and then a

240
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
talk about the next steps that we have

241

so here's the status of the document uh

251
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,240
revision08 was called for working group

252
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
adoption

253
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,120
we have received detailed uh

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240

group members multiple working group

258
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,880
members

259
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,480
and there were some clarification

260
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
questions raised on the email list

261
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040

zebu and roof

267
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,560
uh there were some comments that we

268
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,200
tried to address on the list

269
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,640
and there are still some comments open

270
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,440
and we're planning to address them

271
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
uh document them in the next revision

272
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,120
and

273
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
we'll talk about the plan

274
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,920
to progress further

275
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,120
there were some comments that were

276
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
pointed out as

277
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,680
of immediate concern so those are the

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,320
ones that we will look into uh

279
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
addressing uh in the next revision and

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
then possibly document

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
the other ones in a section

282
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,320
so okay let me move on to the next slide

283
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
where we talk about the next steps

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,240
based on the adoption poll results and

285
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,760
the working group chairs feedback

286
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,079
the plan is for the authors to issue a

287
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,920
new revision which is zero nine going to

288
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,760
be zero nine

289
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
this will address

290
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,079
the the comments that were of immediate

291
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,920
concern

292
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
some of them are related to references

293
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,680
of individual solutions

294
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
that are driven in

295
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,880
other working groups so

296
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,720
those we will leave them out

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,880
of this document for now

298
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,760
um

299
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,720
and

300
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
you know maybe the other the solutions

301
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,519
will be referencing the the uh this this

302
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,040
solution document

303
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,920
um

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
and we will add a new section to track

305
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
all open issues uh that were raised on

306
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
the email uh during the working group

307
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,160
adoption so these issues will need to be

308
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,639
addressed before working group last call

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
um we will change the status of the

310
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,200
document informational we got this

311
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
feedback from

312
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,639
from the poll

313
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,360
and for now uh you know we'll go with

314
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,440
the working group consensus on that and

315
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,600
that and

316
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,800
depending on

317
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
how the document progresses we will

318
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,160
revisit

319
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,040
uh

320
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
once the revision09

321
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,760
is published we will notify the working

322
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
group of its existence and um ask them

323
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
or solicit for further feedback if there

324
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,160
are no concerns phrased uh the guidance

325
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,040
uh

326
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,639
is to republish from the working group

327
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,800
chair is to republish the document as a

328
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
zero zero worker group document

329
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,240
uh the plan now is to push this

330
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
revision09

331
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,360
um

332
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
maybe by the end of this week or

333
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,360
early

334
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
next week

335
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
and uh

336
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
this is these are the milestones uh that

337
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
we have uh set

338
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,440
i don't have much further

339
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,279
to talk about this but i'm happy to

340
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
answer any question um

341
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
that anyone in the working group might

342
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,839
have

343
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,079
it was a quick update

344
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,680
sorry maybe not too much exciting

345
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,440
but i'm happy to talk about many other

346
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
things as well

347
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,360
thank you

348
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
please go ahead yeah uh

349
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,760
yes and you should be able to change

350
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
your slides by uh clicking on the right

351
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
underneath the slides

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,199
okay

353
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,760
yeah uh yeah this presentation is a

354
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,399
quick update to the

355
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,399
uh to this document which is a

356
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,040
service delivery model for the network

357
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,639
sizing

358
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,480
so um

359
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,440
the

360
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
current

361
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,760
data model

362
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,720
a existing document

363
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
we could support

364
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,000
certain types of communication types

365
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
we could do p2p and

366
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
8a any 20

367
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,680
with this update

368
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,279
we'll support

369
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
the p1p and mp2

370
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,639
p

371
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,959
and mp2 mp

372
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,720
the other type of the communications

373
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
so uh this is a simple

374
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
uh young

375
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,800
oh wait a minute

376
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,839
yeah this is a simple

377
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,399
young augmentation

378
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
so we add

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,000
two young modeling constructs

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
one is called replication groups another

381
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,959
one is called receiver constraint group

382
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,079
so that to handle

383
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,839
the p2

384
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,040
mp and mp2p

385
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
so

386
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,920
this is

387
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
the

388
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,720
description about how do we do this the

389
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
idea is that

390
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
we group

391
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,040
several

392
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,040
connectivity constructs together

393
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,360
and once we group them together for the

394
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,759
replication group

395
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
any traffic to send to

396
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,360
one of this

397
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,079
group will be replicated to other

398
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,720
constructs this way will

399
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
easily

400
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,399
make the p2 and p2p construct into a

401
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,680
p2mp

402
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,320
so in the similar way

403
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,160
if we group them

404
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
several uh p2 p2p constructs into a

405
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,720
receiver country group

406
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
then we know on the receiver side we

407
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,639
have constraint

408
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,519
so

409
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,800
we need to have the

410
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,839
constraint applied to all those

411
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,759
constructs to achieve

412
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
mp2p

413
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
uh some examples here

414
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,120
so i don't need to this is p2p so it's

415
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,040
already there

416
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
is a list of

417
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,559
from the

418
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,480
front side to the uh two side so uh

419
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
that's nothing new

420
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
uh here

421
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
this is the idea

422
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,919
for the p2mp so we already have

423
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
two

424
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
constructs id1

425
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
and id2

426
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,919
and here we're trying to do from

427
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,240
nsc5 to both

428
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,039
uh oh i think it's type of the nine and

429
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,200
ten

430
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
then we have

431
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
uh the two

432
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
ids one and two we group them together

433
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,039
so we have this entry list

434
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,880
one and two

435
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,840
then we achieve the replication and then

436
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
it's a p2mp

437
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,640
so similarly for the mp2p

438
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,000
we here we have a two constructs one and

439
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
three

440
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,240
and we put them into a group

441
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
so we know

442
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,679
at the receiver side

443
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,960
we have certain constraints

444
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
so with those two simple modeling

445
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
augmentations we can achieve all types

446
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
of

447
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,360
communications

448
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
so

449
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,000
then the eighth way is already supported

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,480
we don't need to measure here

451
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
so with this way

452
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,240
then

453
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,240
we'll be able to handle

454
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,520
every types required by the networks

455
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
writing

456
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,039
document

457
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,919
this uh this augmentation is only

458
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,480
for this model for now but

459
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,679
we propose this as a generic method

460
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
which can be

461
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
applied to other models if the working

462
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,480
group agrees to do that

463
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,200
uh that's about it and uh

464
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,919
yeah uh yeah this document of it other

465
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,520
things will be ready for the talk

466
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
adoption

467
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,280
uh okay so i see

468
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,160
some

469
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
people lying on the queue

470
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,039
so should we go ahead for the questions

471
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
so so before we open up the cube a very

472
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
high level question

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
so

474
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
you i mean we do have a service data

475
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
model uh that the working group adopted

476
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,720
and i believe you are uh presenting you

477
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,200
are proposing another service model that

478
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
uh

479
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
i believe you are saying it can

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,000
complement the other

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
so i mean can you talk about the

482
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,679
relationship

483
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,679
between the two models and then we can

484
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,760
open up yeah i believe the next

485
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
presentation from lewis

486
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,160
will further clarify the relationships

487
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
here this model

488
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,919
we can use that in two ways

489
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,240
either it can be used as a service

490
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
delivery model which means uh

491
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
once we got service model translated

492
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,840
into the service delivery and

493
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,520
uh map to the network topologies

494
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,919
uh if we wish if a user wish to use this

495
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
model as a service model then this model

496
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
will support

497
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,159
the topology of world

498
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,360
service so you can have

499
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,640
some middle abstract node

500
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,280
specified by the user so that's that's a

501
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
compliment

502
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
okay uh let's start with the questions

503
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,159
craig

504
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,200
hi quite

505
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,360
so um

506
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,799
if i understand correctly all these um

507
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,559
types of communication uh do you um

508
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,159
uh you consider them to be

509
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
unidirectional or bi-directional that's

510
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
right unidirectional

511
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,880
unidirectional so do you see any benefit

512
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,919
of um

513
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
having um

514
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,280
point

515
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,039
bi-directional

516
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,799
yeah for now to point-to-point

517
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,559
bi-directional we need to have two

518
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,600
entries

519
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
one to the one direction and the other

520
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
to the backward direction

521
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,559
uh this is a

522
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,520
yeah

523
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,799
yeah

524
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,320
the they're

525
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,440
okay i don't want to um

526
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,840
uh use this um

527
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,200
um not

528
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
really popular uh mplstp story

529
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,600
but um

530
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
there there are some uh differences in

531
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,840
uh when we um

532
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,039
request bi-directional service and uh at

533
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
that time it was like corrupted or

534
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,559
associated so where they're

535
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,600
traversing the same nodes and links

536
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,880
uh is uh not required

537
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,720
so there

538
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,159
what i want to say is that there are

539
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
different flavors and different types of

540
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
bi-directional point-to-point construct

541
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
so just

542
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
combining two might not be sufficient uh

543
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
sufficiently

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,440
expressive

545
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
um

546
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,080
if you feel proper

547
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,159
we can add some

548
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
further

549
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,919
descriptions through the leaves to

550
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,039
specify yeah we need okay

551
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,960
okay let's think about it and talk about

552
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
english thank you yeah

553
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
tarek

554
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,480
hi derek

555
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
thank you fang for the great

556
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,600
presentation if you go back couple of

557
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,559
slides where you presented the types of

558
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,120
connectivity constructs

559
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,520
you had multi-point to multi-point for

560
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,320
example uh multi-plan to motherboard

561
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
yeah right

562
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,918
um

563
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
right and and

564
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,039
uh would you agree that i could model

565
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
this with a

566
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
a set of point to multi-point

567
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,000
connectivity constructs

568
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
uh that's

569
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
question one and i have another one if

570
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,600
you don't mind

571
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,039
so you mean

572
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,200
you just say

573
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
everything connect to everything without

574
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,039
the

575
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,320
the new addition

576
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,520
uh yeah so this is basically uh uh and

577
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
that's why i need to i need right

578
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
it's a bunch of point to multi-point

579
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,880
so it will give you multi-point to

580
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
multi-point

581
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
uh and maybe we can take it offline

582
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,320
that's fine yeah okay

583
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,360
okay

584
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,919
okay the next question i have is the

585
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
network slice framework draft uh only

586
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,840
talks about uh um

587
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,039
service demarcation points sdps and they

588
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
used to be called nses

589
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
they don't have a

590
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,080
notion of any other

591
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
nodes or endpoints

592
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
like the abstract node that we talked

593
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,520
about a minute ago

594
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,120
you could have a

595
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,000
nodes that are not endpoints

596
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,159
uh in your topology

597
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,799
are we asking the slice framework draft

598
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,840
to mention or talk a little bit about

599
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,279
that and

600
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,960
actually that's my preference i don't

601
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,360
know what the working group will agree

602
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,919
or not but yeah that's

603
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,640
that's something we can think about

604
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
okay thank you

605
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
drew

606
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,159
can i keep it short like uh query is

607
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,480
basically i understand that you in your

608
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,039
document you also mentioned type 2

609
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,320
uh vn model where you want your service

610
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,559
model to have a more control but the

611
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
approach that we took in the vn model

612
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,960
was adding a reference to the topology

613
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
model not augmenting the topology model

614
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
so i was thinking that instead of

615
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,799
creating an itf network slice model in

616
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,960
fact you're using the same name as the

617
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,880
current npi model so it's kind of very

618
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
confusing uh but the main point is that

619
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
having a completely independent model is

620
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
that the right approach or if you have

621
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
these requirements can it be that itf

622
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,400
network slice nvi model is augmented

623
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
with a reference to the t topology model

624
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,360
and the rest of the uh things that you

625
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
are doing to connectivity matrix anyway

626
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,120
makes sense you also say that you want

627
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
to generalize that so if you want to

628
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,919
generalize that isn't that a better

629
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,080
uh modeling approach than what you have

630
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,960
currently in the document

631
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,640
when you say generalize okay so you have

632
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
several questions

633
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,799
the first one

634
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,760
i think

635
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,720
about the vm model and the topology

636
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,120
model this is the same way

637
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,520
as the ictn i think ac tn for type 2

638
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,200
uses t topology model directly

639
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,279
for the type of one you have vmware as

640
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,640
it happens

641
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,840
as a reference not as an augmentation

642
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,400
of a topology model in your case you are

643
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,840
using augmentation instead of

644
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,919
reference if i remember

645
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,159
that that the young

646
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
youngster uh

647
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
modeling description

648
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
for the real model

649
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,159
is for type one

650
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
you are saying what you're saying is

651
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,360
incorrect i'm the author of that

652
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,840
document so i know this well we support

653
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,400
both the types using the same vn model

654
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,720
and both of them reference an abstract

655
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
node in the t topology so that we can

656
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
use the connectivity matrix like you are

657
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,360
currently using right now

658
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
uh well that's

659
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,279
if you think that's a proper approach

660
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,240
then

661
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
the

662
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,840
uh

663
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,400
current

664
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,279
mbi model if we wish we can

665
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,039
make them

666
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,600
to the reference point but i don't see

667
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,000
that easily doable from current status

668
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
of the model development i actually

669
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
should uh

670
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
i i was thinking because we have the t

671
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,320
service mapping and in the t service

672
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,080
mapping graph we decided that we don't

673
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,840
want to add idf network slice it's going

674
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,360
to be confusing in fact i was proposing

675
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,600
i have a document on this where we say

676
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
that itf network slide is getting mapped

677
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,240
to t construct in the same way how we

678
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,919
did for l3 sm and l2 sm etc so if we

679
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,919
follow the same approach i think that

680
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,919
would be a much cleaner solution where

681
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,000
we have idf network slice as a

682
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
independent model and use the t service

683
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,360
mapping approach to add a reference to

684
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,440
the topology and i know i'm

685
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,840
sorry to jump into what is a really good

686
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,279
conversation

687
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,600
but in the interest of time can we uh

688
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,440
can you send that comment to the list

689
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
and then continue yeah i'm not sure i

690
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,760
agree with that because i see you add an

691
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,399
extra layer which is not necessary there

692
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,880
so okay anyway yeah we can talk

693
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,559
yeah but really appreciate the comments

694
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,520
uh danielle last uh i had exactly the

695
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
same comment that the drew would just

696
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
read so if you wanted to give my 30

697
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,320
seconds to drove

698
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,760
i'm willing to leave them to him

699
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,279
now i think the point about uh

700
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,279
having the ability to specify a

701
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
customized topology in uh the service

702
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,840
request i think uh that needs to be

703
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
discussed let's take that to the list

704
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,799
thanks

705
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,480
okay okay

706
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
yeah uh luis i've uh set you up but if

707
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,039
you prefer

708
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,799
uh to just drive from there you can

709
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,960
drive from there it's up to you yeah i

710
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,279
would like to drive from here thank you

711
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,320
okay

712
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,279
okay

713
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,840
so uh this is luis contreras from the

714
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,919
phonic i will present uh an update on

715
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,559
the on the draft this drop trying to

716
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,159
describe use cases and attributes for

717
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,080
the no round interface of the controller

718
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,200
so the motivation for the drug was

719
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,480
initially to to set up some background

720
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,240
in such a way that we could feed all the

721
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,279
other documents in the in the topic so

722
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,960
essentially the

723
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
architecture data models and so with the

724
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,279
idea of creating a clear view of the

725
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,520
different use cases that can be

726
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,960
mapped to itf network slide services

727
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
so um the rationale behind that is that

728
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,919
we i mean from the operator perspective

729
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,960
once we have the the capabilities of um

730
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
instantiating these networks license

731
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,480
they will be to use not only for just

732
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,720
one city set of use cases but for

733
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
whatever use cases that we could have

734
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,039
even services that we can provide today

735
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,039
without the notion of a slice so at the

736
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,200
end to take advantage of the slice was a

737
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,799
concept for er associating

738
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,320
a white

739
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,559
kind of services so the the purpose of

740
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,799
the draft is to cover the

741
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,399
gap analysis in terms of use cases

742
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
identifying slos or sles

743
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,640
attributes and methods that could be

744
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
needed for

745
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
for requesting the slices to the towards

746
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,720
the idea nevertheless controller so the

747
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,480
draft has been already presented in in

748
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,720
previous idf so this is just an update

749
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,840
on the progress

750
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,000
so the use cases documented so far

751
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,520
we have by now

752
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,000
we documented 5g services

753
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,039
we

754
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,799
consider both public and private

755
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,840
networks also nda based services so

756
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,080
chaining of network functions that could

757
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
be deployed in different data centers

758
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,039
also network sharing sd1 and the radio

759
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,399
functionality splits that are being

760
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,000
specified in bodies like oran

761
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
so the updates in in this version so

762
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,200
essentially we

763
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,240
were through some fixes in

764
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
electrical terms

765
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,399
mainly the figures and so we also added

766
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,000
the content related to the private 5g

767
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,919
networks this is a special case that

768
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,799
could bring up some new uh they need

769
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,039
let's see defying new

770
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,080
requirements um for instance

771
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,880
the fact of probably having multi-homing

772
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,039
or the customization of the

773
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,519
abstinence and downstream rates

774
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,960
um

775
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
and also the fact that this use case can

776
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,799
imply that the service provider uses

777
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,039
network slices provided even by other

778
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,480
companies more that could be the

779
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,000
verticals in this case

780
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,880
so we added also a section summarizing

781
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
the attributes and procedures so a kind

782
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
of summary or

783
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,640
at the very end part of the document so

784
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,039
the the objective that

785
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,480
would need to identify comprehensive

786
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,559
slos the sles and the procedures that

787
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,960
could allow to support whatever use case

788
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,039
so having a solution that could be

789
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,840
useful for for whatever purpose

790
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
the weather is possible right so that

791
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,919
section is yet a work in progress or

792
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,399
need much more work for sure but well

793
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,760
the idea would be at the end the main

794
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
outcome of the document would be to

795
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,919
have this kind of summary

796
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,840
that could fit the other documents in

797
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,399
the working group

798
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,919
so as next steps the idea is to complete

799
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,080
the the work in progress we are

800
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,799
considering to add a an an additional

801
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,919
use case about data center

802
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,000
interconnection and the level 8

803
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,679
elaborates or

804
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,600
a bit more the summary section so

805
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,440
essentially to complete

806
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,039
we will also scan for additional

807
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
relevant use cases if any so we invite

808
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,399
people here if

809
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,600
there is something that could be

810
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,080
offenders to be documented to

811
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
have to send to share with us

812
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,519
and to send to the mailing list and so

813
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,760
so invite contributions for sure the

814
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
idea would be for today to collect

815
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,640
feedback and

816
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,399
comments from the working group and we

817
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,919
are expecting to prepare a new version

818
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,000
for the next meeting

819
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,960
including the data center case

820
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,760
so

821
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,279
we the authors consider that the draft

822
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,600
is ready to be adopted so we are we

823
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
would like to ask for working group

824
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,320
adoption

825
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,640
we think that is a valuable document for

826
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,519
um having a clear view on the needs that

827
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,039
could be required to be supported by the

828
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,440
itf negotiation controller and also we

829
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,960
think that the recent discussion in the

830
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
mailing list make this evident the need

831
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,519
of having some document collecting the

832
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,279
use cases and the needs that could be

833
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,720
expected to

834
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,399
to to feed let's say the idea

835
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
nevertheless controller for

836
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,240
instantiating the slice services so with

837
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
this i think that

838
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,799
it's all from my side thank you

839
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,840
any comments questions

840
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,440
uh this seems like a uh a generally

841
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,360
useful document well proof just go ahead

842
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
this seems useful but i was also

843
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,640
wondering do you have any suggestions

844
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,120
for the framework and yang model based

845
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,960
on all the analysis that you are doing

846
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
for the use case is there any concrete

847
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,679
feedback that you have that we as

848
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,840
working group can use

849
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,918
yes well we

850
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,679
think yes

851
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,159
for the framework probably to

852
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,480
to define potential

853
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,918
methods or procedures that could be

854
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,599
required for

855
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,200
for instance in in terms of

856
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,520
capabilities that could be required to

857
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,879
be supported

858
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,760
once we instantiate the slices for

859
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,520
instance retrieving information from the

860
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,839
slices

861
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:34,399
or uh

862
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,079
there is a case that is not coming now

863
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
to my mind uh give me just one second to

864
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,918
think about that this um

865
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,679
is related to modification of slices i

866
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,599
can't cannot remember right now i will

867
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,359
put in the chat later on

868
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,000
and regarding the mbi just for sure

869
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,800
probably to identify slos or sls could

870
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,960
that could be required

871
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,680
to be there in order to satisfy some of

872
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,640
the use cases that we are documenting

873
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,320
oh

874
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,400
yeah hi uh charles eckel and um at cisco

875
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
i uh

876
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,359
sorry to say that i wasn't aware of this

877
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,440
draft until just now but listening to

878
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,119
your presentation and the description of

879
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,839
what it covers uh i'm interested so all

880
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,240
i can say is i'll take a look and then

881
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,480
provide feedback on the list great thank

882
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,480
you

883
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,920
thank you um uh thank you lewis on the

884
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,440
presentation i um the nfv

885
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,599
at least threw my attention and are you

886
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,040
suggesting that uh functions can be

887
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
um you know specified in the service uh

888
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,440
request

889
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,320
uh in certain functions to to be imposed

890
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,920
uh on the slide is that the nfv uh use

891
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,079
case that you talk about

892
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,400
is that something that well we are

893
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
approaching the nfb use case now from

894
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
the perspective of connectivity there is

895
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,320
some work in hc nfb

896
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,240
detailing that in fact we we talked

897
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,680
earlier about deletions for nab so i i

898
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,320
related to actn so all that work is

899
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,960
related to uh respect the connectivity

900
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,800
and and what could be the

901
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,119
the mechanisms expected for net cnb for

902
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,280
control the connectivity in terms of

903
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,280
requesting capacity and so on so far

904
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
what you are commenting about the

905
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
possibility of also including functions

906
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
if i don't interpret wrong the question

907
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
this is something that the is somehow

908
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,280
stated in the framework

909
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
but um but

910
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,280
in in the use case that i command is is

911
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
not reflected in the document so it

912
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,200
could be an option to

913
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
to also let's say complement the use

914
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
case introducing that point

915
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,920
on the picture

916
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,079
okay looks like we've uh reached the end

917
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
of the queue uh i think there's clearly

918
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,400
interest in this um but it'd be good to

919
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
get more discussion on the list

920
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
uh

921
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,320
also particularly interested in hearing

922
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,440
if there are objections to adopting uh

923
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,839
this work

924
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,599
uh on the list you don't have to do it

925
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,960
right now

926
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,760
thank you very much i think jay is up

927
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,200
next

928
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,598
switch over

929
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
some reason your slides were in a

930
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,160
different order

931
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,599
okay we have trolls on the bottom thank

932
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,800
you

933
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
okay thank you

934
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,320
uh hello everyone this is jadon from

935
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,520
hallway i'm going to give an update

936
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,440
about this draft

937
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,520
the scalability considerations for the

938
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,960
network resource partition

939
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,920
here at the closers of this draft i'm

940
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,920
presenting on behalf of these courses

941
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,320
okay first of all uh a brief recap about

942
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,640
the background the vpn plus and the

943
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,160
network slicing

944
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
the vpn plus framework is described in

945
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,240
this draft atf enhanced vpn

946
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
and one of the typical use cases is to

947
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
deliver the idf network slide services

948
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,359
and in the itf network slides draft the

949
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,839
high level realization architecture

950
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,560
of item number slice is described

951
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,800
and um mentioned the mapping of the

952
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,280
nether slice connectivity constructs to

953
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
another label nrps as shown in the

954
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,240
figure on the right side

955
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,680
so uh based on that the item net slash

956
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,960
draft and nrp consists of a set of

957
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,520
dedicated or shared network resources

958
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,839
and it is associated with a filter

959
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,280
topology

960
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,760
so that it can be used to support one or

961
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
a group of network services to help with

962
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,280
the scalability issues

963
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,920
and the scalability of nrp itself is

964
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,599
still important for the widely

965
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,079
deployment of itnf slices

966
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,280
for more applications and more scenarios

967
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,200
so this document provides scalability

968
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,599
considerations of an rp in both the

969
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,119
control plane and the data plane

970
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,240
so here are the updates after the last

971
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,920
item meeting

972
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,000
basically the main major change is that

973
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
the name of the draft is changed from

974
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
the vtn scalability to the nrp

975
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
scalability

976
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,599
this is based on the terminology

977
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,440
discussion in the working group and also

978
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,680
the discussion between the draft authors

979
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,720
we think

980
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,760
that the

981
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
concept of an rp and the vtn

982
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
is really similar but with different

983
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
context

984
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,760
so

985
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,680
it is better to align the terminology in

986
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,839
this document with the other

987
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,960
the frame of draft about network slicing

988
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,760
and the relationship between nrp and vtn

989
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,079
is described in the vpn plus framework

990
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,599
draft so uh

991
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,800
we would suggest to give it a review and

992
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,920
any feedback would be appreciated it

993
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
in this version we also add new

994
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,720
co-authors

995
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,280
as part of the joint effort in alignment

996
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,440
between several network slicing related

997
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,000
documents

998
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
the next change is some updates about

999
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,560
the descriptions and technologies

1000
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,800
to better align with idf network slash

1001
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,640
drops

1002
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,359
the last one but not the least one we

1003
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,040
try to resolve all the

1004
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,280
valuable review comments from adrian and

1005
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,839
other others on the main list so thanks

1006
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,279
a lot for the valuable comments

1007
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
so here are the next steps

1008
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
i think this document provides

1009
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,599
scalability analysis and optimization

1010
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,000
suggestions for the data plane and the

1011
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,160
control plane of the nrp

1012
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,720
and it also provides guidelines to the

1013
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,040
data plan control plane mechanisms and

1014
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,440
the related protocol extensions

1015
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,680
so i think this document is useful for

1016
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,480
to guide the other works in the working

1017
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
group and other related protocol working

1018
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,920
groups

1019
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,160
so the authors believe this version is

1020
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,800
ready for the adoption and we have sent

1021
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,440
the adoption request to the middle east

1022
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,599
at february the 7th

1023
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,599
this year

1024
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,920
okay thank you

1025
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,319
comments

1026
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,680
hi

1027
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,960
go ahead

1028
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,440
thanks g for the great presentation

1029
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,560
there was the second slide there was a

1030
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,400
diagram that you showed if you don't

1031
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
mind flipping back yeah that's it um so

1032
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,280
it drew my attention this diagram and

1033
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,359
thank you for compiling it it's uh

1034
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,280
that's great um

1035
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,000
in here you're not mentioning anything

1036
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,240
about vtn i know that you have you had

1037
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,319
described the relationship between vpn

1038
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,240
and nrp

1039
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,760
um

1040
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,359
do you still see the need to mention vtn

1041
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:16,800
in this document

1042
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,440
given the diagram that you have compiled

1043
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,839
thank you

1044
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,119
uh in this diagram i think we use nrp

1045
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,880
instead of vtn

1046
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,520
and as i mentioned that the relationship

1047
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,800
between the video and the nrp

1048
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,160
is described in the vpn plus framework

1049
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,680
so in this document i think we

1050
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,319
changed both the draft name and the

1051
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,400
terminology in the document

1052
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
from atm to an rp i think that

1053
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
should be okay

1054
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,920
let's reflect the

1055
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,160
consensus from the working group and

1056
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,440
officers

1057
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,920
yep thanks

1058
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,400
any other comments

1059
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
i think this is an interesting uh

1060
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,960
document also we go to get more

1061
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,200
discussions a lot like the comments on

1062
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,640
the last document be good to get more

1063
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,920
discussions

1064
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,680
and um see if there's uh comments or

1065
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,359
objections to adoption

1066
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,880
i think we need a little more review

1067
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,280
before we do an actual poll

1068
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,520
also on the discussion of ni nrp versus

1069
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,680
um uh vpn plus i personally think that

1070
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,319
you know nrp is a more abstract term and

1071
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,000
and there's different ways to realize an

1072
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,400
nrp so i i like that change

1073
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,960
personally so i'm glad to see it

1074
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,119
uh so uh thank you for the work and look

1075
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,440
forward to more discussion on the list

1076
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,280
yeah

1077
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,160
yeah thank you actually

1078
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
yeah just uh one quick

1079
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,359
uh comment

1080
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,000
uh actually this is uh i think this is a

1081
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,920
another new draft we have presented

1082
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,599
several times this is just a new version

1083
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,359
based on the new terminology and the

1084
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,720
draft name

1085
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,760
so

1086
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,880
the content

1087
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,160
has already been stable and perhaps

1088
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,400
we can consider to

1089
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,040
start the poll on it

1090
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,560
unless there's some

1091
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:40,799
significant comments or concerns

1092
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,240
i'm not sure there's a question there i

1093
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,480
mean i think we've just said i mean i'll

1094
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,000
talk to bevan see if he sees it

1095
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,319
differently but uh you know the the the

1096
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,760
way we saw it at the start of the

1097
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,720
meeting if you'd like to see a little

1098
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,800
more discussion on the list before uh

1099
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,880
polling

1100
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,560
or at least give opportunity for some

1101
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,040
discussion

1102
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,920
okay

1103
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
tariq

1104
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,640
hello hello again

1105
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,760
i presume you can hear me

1106
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,560
uh

1107
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,480
so yeah thank you

1108
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,280
it's dark again and i'm going to talk to

1109
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,640
you about a yang data model for uh

1110
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,319
provisioning and managing network

1111
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,839
resource partition

1112
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,200
policies

1113
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,800
uh this

1114
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,920
this draft is is renamed it's a zero

1115
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,480
zero revision now but it actually

1116
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,240
replaces uh

1117
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,000
a draft that

1118
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,240
we had presented earlier uh multiple

1119
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,200
times

1120
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,160
i am presenting this on behalf of all my

1121
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,160
co-authors

1122
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,119
so let me introduce you a bit of

1123
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,400
overview

1124
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,319
on what this

1125
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,720
this data model is trying to

1126
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,480
cover

1127
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,560
there is the network resource partition

1128
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,160
which is introduced in the network

1129
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,079
slicing framework it's a collection of

1130
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,920
resources identified in the underlay

1131
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,240
network to support the network slice

1132
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,200
service

1133
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,760
or any other service that needs this

1134
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,400
logical network structure

1135
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,760
with the required characteristics

1136
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,000
and then we have the nrp policy that's

1137
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,680
introduced in the solution draft that i

1138
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,040
provided an update earlier today

1139
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,280
the nrp policy is a policy construct

1140
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,760
that enables the instantiation of uh

1141
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,280
mechanisms in support of these service

1142
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,680
specific control data plane and control

1143
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,079
plane behaviors on

1144
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,800
uh on the set of topological elements

1145
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,000
associated with nrp

1146
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,560
so the nrp policy is the vehicle to

1147
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,720
instantiate these mechanisms

1148
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,520
um the draft defines the data model for

1149
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,400
the management of these nrp policies uh

1150
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,280
that can be provisioned and managed on

1151
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,839
nrp capable nodes as well as the

1152
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,880
controller in packet networks

1153
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,880
the latest draft was renamed as i

1154
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,480
mentioned earlier

1155
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,079
to align and it does align uh

1156
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:28,559
it tries to align itself to the network

1157
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,200
slice framework as well as the solution

1158
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,319
um

1159
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:37,558
base draft uh mentioned here

1160
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,079
um so what's in the nrp policy uh the

1161
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,520
nrp policy tries to uh model a number of

1162
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,319
modes for partitioning

1163
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,040
for creating network resource partitions

1164
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,319
uh one mode is a

1165
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,400
partitioning the network in the control

1166
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,559
plane only and the data plane is

1167
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,079
agnostic of the partitioning

1168
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,720
then we have a mode where the data we

1169
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,640
partition the resources in the data

1170
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,240
plane

1171
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,079
and then the last mode is when we

1172
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,640
partition resources in both the control

1173
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,960
plane as well as the data plane

1174
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
in

1175
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,960
in the case of partitioning in the data

1176
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,000
plane uh the packet will need to be

1177
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,240
identified uh

1178
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
so it will carry some

1179
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,200
um some field uh so that we can invoke

1180
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,599
the data plane per hop behavior on it

1181
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,760
uh associated with the network resource

1182
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,800
partition

1183
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,839
so these fields uh genetically we call

1184
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,880
them flow aggregate selector field

1185
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,760
um

1186
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,040
and it it is provisioned using the nrp

1187
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,880
policy as well

1188
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,119
uh and in the other two modes uh

1189
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,920
we for reservation purposes we we could

1190
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,400
rely on a distributed or centralized

1191
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,400
resource reservation manager

1192
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,480
uh so that we can do bandwidth aware or

1193
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,839
uh traffic engineering

1194
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,640
so the data model

1195
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,040
i'm going to cover today

1196
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,000
will try to model all these three modes

1197
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,480
i mentioned

1198
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,079
earlier so this is the tree view of the

1199
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,040
data model uh there's a list of nrp

1200
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,640
policies and

1201
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,880
each one of those policies has a name

1202
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,880
and an id that are unique

1203
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,040
and then there are three made or four

1204
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,640
major branches

1205
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,440
a resource observation branch

1206
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,040
and then a flow aggregate selector

1207
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,800
branch

1208
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,520
per hop behavior and the topology

1209
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,280
i will talk more details on the next

1210
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,200
slide on each one of those

1211
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,079
but the policies list is hanging down of

1212
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,800
the networks so we're augmenting this

1213
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,480
network's path

1214
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,240
xpath

1215
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,599
because the

1216
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,800
the model

1217
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,119
can provision can be provisioned on the

1218
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,319
device or on a controller so we thought

1219
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,760
it's

1220
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,359
it has to be device agnostic

1221
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,359
um

1222
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,400
so i mentioned uh there are uh the the

1223
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,119
list has a

1224
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,280
an entry which has a name and an id and

1225
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,079
then there are these key elements

1226
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,440
uh

1227
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,880
resource reservation will manage the

1228
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,960
reservations on this link in the control

1229
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,960
plane and then we have a

1230
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,359
flow aggregate selector that can be

1231
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,319
carried inside the packet or and then it

1232
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,520
allows nodes along the path to identify

1233
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,240
those packets and then associate them

1234
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,200
with the nrp the per hop behavior which

1235
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,079
is the data plane policies qs policies

1236
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,119
that

1237
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,119
are associated with nrp

1238
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,119
and then finally there are

1239
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,280
filters that can be invoked

1240
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,880
so that we can

1241
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,520
compose the topology that's associated

1242
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,240
with

1243
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,919
the the network resource partition

1244
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
uh

1245
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,200
um i think i'm going to repeat myself

1246
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,839
here and talk about the reservations and

1247
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,240
and the resource reservation facilitate

1248
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,480
uh preference based preemption as well

1249
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,319
as state aware traffic engineering when

1250
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,839
we're placing paths

1251
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,558
in the nrp itself

1252
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,200
um the flow aggregate selector we i did

1253
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,720
meant

1254
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,240
to touch on this

1255
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,880
lightly earlier it's a field carried in

1256
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,319
the packet it can take multiple forms uh

1257
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:36,720
we have uh we the model allows is

1258
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,400
flexible enough to allow multiple

1259
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,920
variants uh

1260
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
so the flow aggregate selector for an

1261
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,319
nrp can be a range of labels for example

1262
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,240
it can be one

1263
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,920
uh label carried in any packet

1264
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,079
or can be an ip

1265
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,359
destination address or

1266
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,440
or it can be carried in an extension

1267
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,520
header in ipv6

1268
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,480
so

1269
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,559
for each of these flavors there are some

1270
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,079
drafts

1271
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,400
that that are out there

1272
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,119
which describe the details of the of the

1273
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,119
flow aggregate selector or the field

1274
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:13,520
itself

1275
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,480
the perhaps behavior dictates the qos

1276
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,680
data plane

1277
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,680
that can be associated with the with the

1278
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,119
nrp itself

1279
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,760
and right now it's just a string which

1280
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,440
reference which is resolved on the

1281
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,440
device we're not carrying the whole uh

1282
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,839
qs profile along with the

1283
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,920
with the policy itself we're just

1284
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,960
referencing a a profile that sits on the

1285
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,440
device

1286
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,280
and finally the topology filters

1287
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,920
it's a container that will list it can

1288
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,480
list multiple filters and combined will

1289
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,040
define the set of links and nodes that

1290
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,920
participate in the nrp topology

1291
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,920
um

1292
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,920
the the filters itself can be used so

1293
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,720
that we can override um

1294
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,680
certain uh you know reservations or flow

1295
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,040
aggregates selected on certain

1296
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,359
topological elements if they're not

1297
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:15,520
uniform across the network

1298
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,280
so using the filters

1299
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,599
we can also override

1300
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,079
the defaults for the whole nrp policy

1301
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,280
and lastly in terms of next steps um

1302
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,880
uh the topology container will be

1303
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,720
augmented to include the reference to

1304
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,599
the resultant topology we i did mention

1305
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,720
the filters are modeled already in the

1306
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,319
in the data model so we can define

1307
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,640
filters but after applying the filter on

1308
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,720
the full network

1309
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,440
topology the there might be a subset

1310
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,079
topology that we can reference

1311
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,960
and this is what we're going to tackle

1312
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,119
in the next revision either through a

1313
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,839
reference to a topology or

1314
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,280
other

1315
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,480
other ways

1316
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,200
but but the the idea is that we can show

1317
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,520
the set of links that match the filter

1318
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,040
as a result of applying it

1319
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,119
we do welcome

1320
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,720
feedback from the working group on this

1321
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,640
work

1322
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,440
we have presented it multiple times and

1323
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,960
after doing this next revision we think

1324
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,040
you know we will let the chairs know

1325
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,280
that you know it should be ready for

1326
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,280
working group adoption but at this time

1327
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,280
this is our plan

1328
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,599
i think uh that was it

1329
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,599
thank you

1330
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:40,960
i'm happy to answer any questions that

1331
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,000
the working group might have

1332
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,960
i don't see anybody else at mike um can

1333
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,960
we go to the next presentation

1334
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,119
thank you

1335
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:14,720
hello

1336
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,240
can you hear me

1337
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,279
yeah you're um

1338
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,880
it says you want to share but i've

1339
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,960
already given you permission and i'm a

1340
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,559
little worried to touch the screen

1341
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,079
because this is how we ended up with

1342
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,240
adrian not being able to talk

1343
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,000
um so if you don't mind uh we'll just go

1344
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,280
through just tell me next then i'll

1345
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,119
advance for you

1346
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:38,000
okay

1347
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,480
that's good i think adrian was this was

1348
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,319
agent's theory of how he you know ended

1349
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,000
up with him with no audio

1350
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,880
so please continue

1351
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,000
okay thank you this is woah

1352
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,119
and

1353
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,079
uh i'm going to present this anarchy

1354
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,520
young module

1355
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,720
on behalf of all the authors

1356
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,040
next please

1357
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,960
uh i think everyone has just heard that

1358
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,960
tariq has presented nrp policy model

1359
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,240
so

1360
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,440
it's obvious to wondering uh what's the

1361
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,280
difference with this nrp model and the

1362
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,599
nazi policy model

1363
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,520
so

1364
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,040
my understanding is um

1365
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,720
is uh there are major two differences

1366
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,240
um one

1367
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,040
uh

1368
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,119
difference is

1369
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,000
uh this nrp model

1370
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,839
uh is not just about

1371
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:42,839
uh

1372
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:47,359
nip instantiation yes that means nfp

1373
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,920
creation

1374
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,960
this model also includes nlp

1375
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,319
monitoring

1376
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,119
and also modification management

1377
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:01,359
and the other uh

1378
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,520
major difference

1379
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,559
from my perspective the other is the

1380
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,920
topology

1381
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
modeling approach

1382
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,280
i will talk about this on the next

1383
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,480
slides

1384
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,680
and uh here you can see that

1385
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,880
uh the nrp model is sit

1386
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,920
uh

1387
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,520
under the

1388
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,839
network slice

1389
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:28,319
controller southbound interface

1390
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,359
this

1391
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,079
is a network configuration model

1392
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,280
and

1393
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,760
it is

1394
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,680
assumed to be used together with layer

1395
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,119
for example

1396
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,079
their

1397
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,240
3 vpn network model or layer 2

1398
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,000
vp model to realize the network's slice

1399
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,520
services

1400
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,319
so

1401
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,280
in

1402
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,280
this way different connectivity

1403
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,040
construct of

1404
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,920
one or more multiple network slice

1405
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,040
service

1406
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,319
can be

1407
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:03,839
mapped to

1408
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,760
nrp resources

1409
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,480
so next please

1410
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:14,960
uh

1411
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,280
this is a uh

1412
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,559
the major difference with the nrp policy

1413
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,400
model i just

1414
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,599
mentioned

1415
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,319
in my understanding

1416
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,079
the left hand

1417
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,720
shows the house

1418
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,839
net

1419
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,520
network slice

1420
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,720
connectivity construct how different

1421
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,839
how

1422
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:41,119
the connectivity construct mapped to the

1423
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,079
nrp resources

1424
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,000
as you can see that

1425
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,559
there are two nip

1426
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,200
instance

1427
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,559
one is blue

1428
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:53,839
the other is

1429
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:54,799
red

1430
00:58:54,799 --> 00:58:57,280
so each nip

1431
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,640
can

1432
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,559
accommodate different connectivity

1433
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,520
construct like blue network slice

1434
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,920
service can map to that nip one and red

1435
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,079
come up to another p2

1436
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,760
uh the red is just a point to point

1437
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,200
connectivity construct

1438
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,960
that connection

1439
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,319
so

1440
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,400
we think that uh hnrp can have its own

1441
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,640
customized topology

1442
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,680
to

1443
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,480
uh

1444
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,040
to support different connections

1445
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,559
so that's uh

1446
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,760
the difference is that policy because uh

1447
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,599
policy seems only

1448
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:40,240
use the filter policy

1449
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,680
uh to the network controller

1450
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,960
instead of the these customized

1451
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,799
nodes and links to the controller

1452
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,400
and

1453
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,119
the framework draft says there are

1454
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,240
multiple

1455
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,359
different ways of implementation of napi

1456
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,400
topology

1457
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,440
so

1458
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,720
in

1459
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,520
in

1460
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,960
in this model we are trying to

1461
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,119
modeling it

1462
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:09,920
uh

1463
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:11,520
try to model

1464
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,160
all these different approaches like the

1465
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,000
first one is that

1466
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,160
it could be derived from physical

1467
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,839
topology

1468
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,280
and the other

1469
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,319
topology could be filtered topology like

1470
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,319
layer 3 topology t topology and even sr

1471
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:30,960
topology

1472
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,920
and

1473
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,440
uh

1474
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,960
this each nfp topology could be just

1475
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,880
part of these

1476
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,640
future topology or the physical topology

1477
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,960
it doesn't need to be the the whole

1478
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,720
topology

1479
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,319
and uh

1480
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,559
we're also modeling that

1481
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,440
multiple nrps can share

1482
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,240
some

1483
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,760
same base

1484
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,880
layer 3 topology and t topologies

1485
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,960
so it's not need that each nrp has its

1486
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,160
very own topology so we

1487
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,079
try to modeling all these approaches

1488
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,040
so next please

1489
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,119
uh here is a we

1490
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,640
modeling the anap resources uh this is a

1491
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,400
quite different with

1492
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,520
uh policy also that

1493
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,119
we we think

1494
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,440
not only the bandwidth reservation is

1495
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,760
part of an rp resource

1496
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,920
we are modeling

1497
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,920
uh also like nfp has its own data plane

1498
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,079
identifier used to

1499
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:45,520
uh in data packets to map to nrp

1500
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,880
resources

1501
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:51,599
and also each nrp can help has its own

1502
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,200
control plane

1503
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,680
uh in that way

1504
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,640
uh

1505
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,200
during the for each nip

1506
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,680
root computation they can

1507
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,520
uh

1508
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,799
constraint uh with an epic topology and

1509
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:09,440
also the sl and lse

1510
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,079
constraints

1511
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,119
so

1512
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,760
next please

1513
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,359
you have some people yeah i'm sure

1514
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,520
okay

1515
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,480
yes uh please uh

1516
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,720
i can't have the comments great go ahead

1517
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,400
clarify um

1518
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,520
what you see as a link of a slice

1519
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,039
and what

1520
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:45,280
give example of link specific

1521
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,280
resource

1522
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,720
uh so your question is uh what is

1523
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,280
the slice service link

1524
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,079
or

1525
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:58,880
you mean what is link specific resources

1526
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:01,280
right yeah because because for example

1527
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,280
so you you say that bandwidth

1528
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,400
reservation as a network wide

1529
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,880
and link specific

1530
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,440
so yes

1531
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,559
i can imagine that uh it's a sender

1532
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,680
oh it's

1533
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:22,799
i mean that uh for network wild

1534
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,280
resources that means that

1535
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,079
almost every uh link

1536
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,880
they have same uh bandwidth resources

1537
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,280
like one gigabit

1538
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,559
but if it's for uh link specific it

1539
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:39,520
means that we can just have like

1540
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,240
uh links specific like

1541
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,520
500 megabits can be override for that

1542
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,880
link

1543
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,920
is that

1544
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,160
can i answer my does

1545
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,960
that that seems to be a

1546
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,200
property of realization of a slice

1547
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,799
not the slice itself

1548
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,119
it's not the last slice it's nrp

1549
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,640
resources it's not specific to some

1550
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:09,359
slice service

1551
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,240
no but it's how you realize this was

1552
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,720
service

1553
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,960
slide service means that to

1554
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:24,799
sdp to another sdp you mean that right

1555
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,760
that could be a tunnel

1556
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,119
that's okay so

1557
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,000
you go through these things okay so you

1558
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,640
view link as a connection between two

1559
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,279
sdps

1560
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:40,480
no this an nfp is the

1561
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,520
like this could be physical topology

1562
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:48,160
this doesn't mean it's abstract note

1563
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:54,240
but my understanding of what we're

1564
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,440
trying to

1565
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,960
achieve is

1566
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,799
an abstraction

1567
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:02,559
so i would agree that if link is viewed

1568
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:06,319
as a connection between two sdps

1569
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,038
but if

1570
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,760
okay can i go to the previous slide

1571
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,799
please

1572
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:17,038
yes

1573
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:20,319
yes this one

1574
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:23,599
i mean this nfp is quite uh like each

1575
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:27,440
link is relevant with the underlay

1576
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,880
network it's

1577
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,319
it's not the like abstract link between

1578
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,720
sdp i mean like

1579
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,200
uh that red uh

1580
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,880
point-to-point

1581
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,319
uh

1582
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,160
network slice service

1583
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,920
it can map to an rp2 right

1584
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,280
so it will

1585
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,520
traverse two nodes

1586
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,480
or

1587
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,520
it could be

1588
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,680
with protection they could be traverse

1589
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,680
five nodes

1590
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:58,480
so is that clear

1591
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,480
well yes it's clear but that suggests

1592
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,839
that

1593
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,559
well at least in my understanding that

1594
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:08,960
it should have been a model of the

1595
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,079
technology that realizes the slides

1596
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,440
and then yes resources

1597
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,200
yeah please

1598
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,520
and then the resources will be on that

1599
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,680
so whether it's a

1600
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,400
evpn or if it's vpos

1601
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,000
uh l2 vpn

1602
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,520
i mean this nrp could be used for like

1603
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,200
different vpn

1604
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,559
i mean it doesn't need to be specific to

1605
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:39,750
one vpn

1606
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,079
[Music]

1607
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:43,440
okay

1608
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,839
thank you

1609
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:01,520
tariq you're mute

1610
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,319
i cannot hear you

1611
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,799
i thought like we can hear you

1612
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,960
maybe you should go on until he and

1613
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,480
tariq when you get your voice working

1614
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:16,160
just speak up

1615
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,920
okay uh

1616
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,920
next please

1617
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,480
uh do you want this one

1618
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:25,760
um i i mean i already uh

1619
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,039
yes

1620
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,680
i can directly go to that monetary one

1621
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,799
because i just finished resource

1622
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,480
yeah that's what i found okay

1623
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:35,920
yes thank you

1624
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,760
and yeah this is what i uh mentioned

1625
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,720
about the different with nrp policy

1626
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,280
because this nrp model

1627
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,720
is uh

1628
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:50,400
also used for monitoring and also like

1629
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,359
when

1630
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,599
a network slide service uh requested it

1631
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:57,440
can be used to see

1632
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,599
uh whether this nrp

1633
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,039
has the available resources

1634
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:04,480
so like

1635
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:06,000
in this uh

1636
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,839
dnrp instance

1637
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:10,799
uh each link has has its resource

1638
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,880
bandwidth uh usage

1639
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,399
and it could has uh the perlink delay or

1640
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,439
loss

1641
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,479
so it can be used for the

1642
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,960
network slice controller to evaluate

1643
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,238
whether this nfp instance

1644
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:29,198
can be used to support

1645
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,000
a new network slide service

1646
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:32,880
so

1647
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,319
this is for the nfp monitor we

1648
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:39,198
augment the network

1649
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,640
ietf network model with link specific

1650
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,600
uh status

1651
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,640
next please

1652
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:53,239
he's back we can try him again maybe

1653
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,520
hello oh yes

1654
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,238
please okay thank you yeah the last time

1655
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,319
uh yeah that mike

1656
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:02,560
didn't give me an option to unmute

1657
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,439
so yeah there was a bug somehow

1658
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,679
there was a slide where you were talking

1659
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:09,439
about bandwidth reservation uh yeah

1660
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,000
exactly thank you last slide number four

1661
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,799
um

1662
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,719
i just want to make a clarification or a

1663
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,479
correction because you referenced the

1664
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:19,040
nrp policy data model

1665
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,000
while you are describing the bullets so

1666
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,198
in fact the nrp policy data model covers

1667
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,520
all three bullets that you have all the

1668
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:29,679
three bullets the bandwidth reservation

1669
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,040
as well as the data plane

1670
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,600
selector field um

1671
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,000
you call it data plane id as well as the

1672
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,799
control plane uh or the topology

1673
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:42,640
associated with uh

1674
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,839
with nrp

1675
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:47,040
um so that was a clarification uh my

1676
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:50,399
question now is uh my understanding of

1677
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,000
reading through the document is that you

1678
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,199
want to use the topology model as a

1679
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,320
device

1680
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:58,960
to configure or provision a device

1681
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,640
is that correct

1682
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,840
and if so it it's not uh

1683
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,320
it's not usual to use a topology model

1684
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,520
to to provision the device

1685
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,280
oh

1686
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,600
that's my uh i don't

1687
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,679
remember that my um like this model is

1688
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:19,360
right now can support device

1689
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:21,120
configuration

1690
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,280
this is uh right now

1691
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,159
is a

1692
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:25,199
network

1693
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:29,120
uh i i just uh on the first page i

1694
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,520
showed that right now this model is a

1695
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,440
network model

1696
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,640
uh maybe in the in the future we can

1697
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,120
consider whether it can be like

1698
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,880
used for device like some attributes

1699
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,120
can be

1700
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:49,199
maybe i misunderstood because these

1701
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,040
attributes that you have on the slide

1702
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,960
the three of them um

1703
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,400
will need to be provisioned on the

1704
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,640
device

1705
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,280
right let's see the data plane uh

1706
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,640
profile as well as the reservations yeah

1707
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,320
i agree with you on this yes

1708
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:08,639
thank you

1709
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,600
so i

1710
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,000
i think this i will quick go through

1711
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,880
this uh this is almost the last one uh

1712
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,000
and this uh nappy modification is uh

1713
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,120
used to

1714
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,560
um

1715
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,159
to echo the

1716
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,520
framework draft uh definition that that

1717
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,800
each nrp is not fixed it can be extended

1718
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,600
as network condition change so

1719
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,280
uh the model also support this use case

1720
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,600
next please

1721
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,280
so uh that's

1722
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,760
all and uh we think

1723
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,600
uh this model and also nlp policy model

1724
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,520
they don't contradict

1725
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,280
and i think this is one approach

1726
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,320
and rp policies or uh the other approach

1727
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,600
so

1728
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,800
that's

1729
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,159
uh

1730
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:02,080
that's all from my side

1731
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:06,920
and i think continuing yeah

1732
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,440
thank you

1733
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,239
okay

1734
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:14,159
uh yeah we look forward to seeing the

1735
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:15,600
discussion particularly the relationship

1736
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,719
between the two uh two drafts

1737
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,159
and i think luis you're gonna try to

1738
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,400
share uh locally

1739
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,639
yep

1740
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,480
so you should be able to do so now

1741
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,840
i'm not sure

1742
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:38,239
it's not being shared right

1743
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:40,560
it should let you share

1744
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,040
there you go

1745
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,360
okay

1746
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,120
it says it's being started i don't see

1747
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,719
it yet but that might be a local issue

1748
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:52,480
on my side

1749
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,280
you're sharing your screen okay

1750
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,960
okay great it looks good thank you

1751
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,880
thank you so

1752
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,320
what i will present

1753
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,199
now is another draft with the idea of

1754
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:06,800
exploring the ways of instantiating the

1755
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,719
itf network slices

1756
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,640
in service provider networks by using

1757
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,880
all the machinery of itf so with the

1758
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,520
tools i say that we have nowadays right

1759
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,640
so i

1760
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,480
work on this with my colleague samir and

1761
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,800
oscar from telefonica with victor lopez

1762
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,800
and andres arukuy from siena

1763
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,000
oh okay sorry so just as a reminder of

1764
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,040
the goals and uh sorry and the non-goals

1765
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,320
of the draft the ds2 reuse exist

1766
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,080
sorry

1767
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,400
now okay so the idea is to reuse

1768
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,960
existing idf machinery to operate the

1769
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:43,120
idf network's license or from our site

1770
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,199
to understand how long we could go with

1771
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,080
the the tools that we have today

1772
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,679
and evaluate the existing jump models

1773
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,640
the ones that are already as

1774
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,280
released as refses documents adopted in

1775
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,760
working groups or even individual drafts

1776
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,960
to understand again how far we can go

1777
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,560
in order to map the idea of network

1778
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,040
slides with the tools that we have today

1779
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,280
and with that exercise to identify

1780
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,520
potential gaps

1781
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,360
in terms of requirements or models or

1782
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,560
whatever that we could bring back to the

1783
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,719
to those models to those documents it's

1784
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,880
not a goal of this graph to

1785
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,880
define any new model

1786
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,560
and not

1787
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,640
as well to redefine architectures of new

1788
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,719
requirements but it's true that we will

1789
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,800
explore different architectures and that

1790
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,760
could be

1791
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,239
feasible let's say in service provider

1792
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,560
scenarios i will comment on that later

1793
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,080
on

1794
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,520
so

1795
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:38,640
okay

1796
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,880
so the context the kind of

1797
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,320
material that we are using for doing

1798
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
this exercise in the case of ids network

1799
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,920
slices we are looking at the framework

1800
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,800
document for sure also to the use case

1801
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,760
document that we i presented before

1802
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,280
this is in terms of requirements in

1803
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,120
terms of the framework itself for

1804
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,679
providing the the network slide services

1805
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,199
and also to consider the slice

1806
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,640
attributes and functionalities that

1807
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,360
could be expected in another slice

1808
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,880
from the point of view on our automation

1809
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,400
that could be the

1810
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,920
what we could find in the salvo

1811
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,120
interface

1812
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,719
we are considering or whereas for other

1813
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,640
ideas to consider let's say service

1814
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,120
models available so uh lxsm i mean l2sm

1815
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,520
3sm and so also to consider network

1816
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,800
models

1817
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,800
again larger to an m like the three and

1818
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,080
m

1819
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,760
and then considering if necessary as

1820
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,840
well the t models the series mapping

1821
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,560
associated to these te models and other

1822
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,159
models that could come

1823
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:34,800
maybe related to acl routine policies

1824
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,000
and so on so far

1825
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,199
and from the point of view of

1826
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,360
architectural framework we are looking

1827
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,040
at the the refses that you can see there

1828
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,199
so the framework for automating uh

1829
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,719
services and network management the

1830
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:46,719
framework for abstraction and control of

1831
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,719
the inaugural so the act and framework

1832
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,480
and the service models

1833
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,480
rfc as well

1834
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,440
so

1835
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,280
there are any potential architecture

1836
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,760
architectural options we are looking at

1837
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,600
that are now documented in the draft we

1838
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,600
are considering three of them the one on

1839
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,600
the left will be essentially the

1840
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,040
go in the

1841
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,960
with the idea of having a a kind of

1842
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,520
master controller or hierarchical uh

1843
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,280
controller that could

1844
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,920
uh host the c as a component maybe an

1845
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,239
itf network slice controller

1846
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,159
and being this master controller

1847
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,520
interacting

1848
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,679
with different network controllers that

1849
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,280
could be for

1850
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,840
for i mean for for multi technology

1851
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,000
purposes so maybe one optical another

1852
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,960
one for ip and so or even for acting on

1853
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,440
different parts of the network

1854
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,960
the architecture in the middle is

1855
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,719
essentially the canonical architecture

1856
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:38,320
that is being defined in the framework

1857
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,140
documents so

1858
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:40,480
[Music]

1859
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,800
well known in in this community

1860
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:45,440
and the one on the on the right

1861
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:47,280
which consider is to have the the

1862
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,960
networkless controller as part of a

1863
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:51,600
network controller right so probably the

1864
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,000
the differences are not so many on this

1865
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,760
but the idea would be to try to

1866
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,040
understand what could be different

1867
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,320
options to to have right

1868
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:03,199
so um updates from the previous version

1869
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:05,839
we uh

1870
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:08,320
introduced a

1871
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,080
an idea of mapping of the or

1872
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:11,520
relationship between the models that are

1873
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,440
described uh based on different

1874
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,679
architectural options so essentially

1875
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:17,440
with a framework of

1876
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:18,880
different service models how we

1877
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,199
interpret that could be the the mapping

1878
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,199
then we added a new section for uh

1879
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:26,320
service models that previously were was

1880
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,880
the the the content were there but not

1881
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,880
the section itself so we created an

1882
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,640
independent section for that

1883
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:34,880
for for um illustrating the network

1884
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,520
slice mapping case and then we included

1885
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,840
an annex trying to do a mapping between

1886
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,640
the itf and s

1887
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,320
normal interface service has been

1888
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,920
defined today

1889
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,239
with one of the use one one of the cases

1890
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:49,679
that could be to realize that with a

1891
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,239
liar free service model right so our

1892
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,560
idea is to keep progressing on this and

1893
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,480
identify gaps and so on so i will detail

1894
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,960
a little bit each of these updates so

1895
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,640
regarding the relation relationship

1896
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,199
between models we took the

1897
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:04,080
the

1898
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,320
the idea of models that is now provided

1899
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,320
in rfc

1900
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:11,600
8309 but essentially we we have on on

1901
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,280
the right side the

1902
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,320
the oss and bss uh models that could be

1903
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,239
uh applicable so

1904
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:20,080
we could release this from the picture

1905
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,640
so with no no models in that space

1906
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:24,800
and then we took the

1907
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,320
the part of the customer service models

1908
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:27,679
and the part of the reward service

1909
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,920
models in our understanding

1910
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:32,560
the how the negotiability service model

1911
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,400
fits would be as part of customer

1912
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,040
service and module and we could

1913
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,360
consider two kind of of uh translations

1914
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,480
let's say one could be the to this the

1915
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,920
to the existing service whether the

1916
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,239
layer 2 sm or the ladder 3 sm so this is

1917
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:47,600
where you can see the

1918
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,400
the

1919
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,440
arrow

1920
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,040
interconnecting these two so we could

1921
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,400
expect some translation from the network

1922
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,560
slide service model to either layer 2

1923
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,880
service model or the systems model but

1924
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,880
also we could consider another

1925
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,880
kind of translation that could be from

1926
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,960
the itf network slide service model

1927
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:04,480
towards the

1928
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,280
network service models here probably the

1929
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,520
the arrow how as it is depicted is a

1930
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:11,360
little bit misleading because the

1931
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,120
intention is not to reflect a kind of

1932
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,960
east-west interface but also a kind of

1933
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,440
uh let's say salvon interface or a

1934
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,920
southbound translation let's say so we

1935
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,679
will correct this in the in the next

1936
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,920
version so the idea essentially that we

1937
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,440
reflected in the graph is that we could

1938
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,040
have this kind of relationship between

1939
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:29,199
the models so taking the

1940
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:30,080
the

1941
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,360
the parameters the attributes of the

1942
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,840
network model and being translated

1943
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,760
either to service model or to network

1944
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,679
model

1945
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:39,760
so a second update was the addition of

1946
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,000
this section for a neighborhood slice

1947
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,520
mapping to the service model mapping

1948
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,920
again the context was the con the text

1949
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,600
was more or less

1950
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,679
there but was not clearly reflected so

1951
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:53,440
we created this a new section

1952
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:54,320
and yeah

1953
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,480
basically with the idea of aligning with

1954
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,799
the rfc8969

1955
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,080
and then

1956
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,239
we created this annex uh probably is

1957
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:06,080
also misleading the usage of the world

1958
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,600
relationship here is essentially a

1959
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,880
mapping a mapping between the nsc mbi

1960
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,360
jam model and in this case the layer 3

1961
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,600
service model this is a an initial

1962
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,159
exercise it's an ongoing pro work in

1963
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,560
progress so probably is not

1964
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,040
exact or not correct at all but our idea

1965
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,400
is to keep continuing these kind of

1966
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,239
exercises to understand what could be

1967
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,920
potential gaps between the models or

1968
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:29,840
what kind of parameters could not be

1969
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,480
taken into consideration because the

1970
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,719
let's say the the the the service model

1971
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,040
of the regular model we are mapping to

1972
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,199
lacks of these capabilities

1973
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,719
the phone is in in this case in the

1974
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,719
larger free service model we see that

1975
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:44,239
there are there could be aspects like

1976
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,280
packet

1977
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:46,880
packet error rate or so that could be

1978
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,679
expressed and negative is a level that

1979
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:52,159
cannot be mapped today at larger three

1980
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,639
service models right so this is the

1981
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,320
objective is on how to start

1982
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,840
understanding what could be these this

1983
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:59,600
kind of

1984
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,520
gaps that that could be

1985
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,800
could exist

1986
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,480
this does not prevent that the later on

1987
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,159
the slides could be realized in this

1988
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,760
case with liability service model maybe

1989
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,080
yes but probably we could

1990
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,480
consider at the time of realizing the

1991
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,199
slides with some specific technology to

1992
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,560
leverage that technology for

1993
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,800
accomplishing for instance the packet

1994
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,280
loss rate in this example right

1995
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,280
so this is the analysis that is there by

1996
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,440
now is

1997
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,159
writing as an annex or idea would be to

1998
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,239
take this back to the main body of the

1999
01:21:30,239 --> 01:21:32,320
of the document and probably and for

2000
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,400
sure i mean providing some further

2001
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,199
examples of mapping so

2002
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:39,520
at the end having a result as a main

2003
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,440
outcome what could be those potential

2004
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,760
gaps between between models

2005
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:45,920
so as the next step we will work on on

2006
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,600
version 0 4 there are a lot of editorial

2007
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,440
fixes that we need to

2008
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,480
to

2009
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:53,360
fix

2010
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,639
so apologies for that because the

2011
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,760
document is not very very clean

2012
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,000
we will consider or we are thinking and

2013
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,760
this is also some some thoughts that we

2014
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,520
have in mind to consider new

2015
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,080
architectural options i will present

2016
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,320
after this slide

2017
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,239
and yeah this new version this clean

2018
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,159
version we expect to release as soon as

2019
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,239
possible our objective is also to keep

2020
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:16,000
working on on detailing the different

2021
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,760
implementation options so you have to

2022
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,840
say ladder freezer model to service

2023
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,440
model and so on so far

2024
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,840
and for sure collect

2025
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,600
additional operational requirements that

2026
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:26,719
could

2027
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,280
result of this gap analysis

2028
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,280
without trying to provide feedback to

2029
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,679
the solutions labs and for sure we are

2030
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,600
open to collective from the working

2031
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,320
group if this is of interest thank you

2032
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,800
oh sorry just one one

2033
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,120
the very last slide with this additional

2034
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,360
proposed architecture so but this is

2035
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,040
totally working progress this is not in

2036
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,960
the document just to to collect feedback

2037
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,960
from you if possible

2038
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,719
in this meeting we are considering two

2039
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,360
potential architectures additional ones

2040
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,639
uh the one on the on your left

2041
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:00,320
is essentially to consider the fact that

2042
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,480
the uh one

2043
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,800
one service as requested today could be

2044
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,040
later on realized through a negative

2045
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:08,800
slice so somehow having a service model

2046
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,719
on top and a negative

2047
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,120
model at the bottom okay this could be

2048
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,719
maybe just as an example could be the

2049
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:16,960
case that we receive a liar free service

2050
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,679
model like a 3bpm and we realize that

2051
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,719
vpn may be using an otn slice that could

2052
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,080
be an example

2053
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,159
and the one on the right essentially

2054
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:28,719
what um considers is that the network

2055
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:30,320
slice controller could be part or it

2056
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,719
could be moved let's say to the oss

2057
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,120
so somehow interacting on the top with

2058
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,360
an existing deployment of sdn control

2059
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,520
capabilities in the network so these are

2060
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,320
just ideas for the for discussion and

2061
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,040
that's all from my side thank you

2062
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,960
um two really quick questions and then

2063
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,199
we need to move on to the next because

2064
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:50,639
you're already stealing time from your

2065
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,920
next

2066
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,800
right

2067
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,800
hi uh pawan piram um

2068
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,560
the document does make for a good read

2069
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,639
it has sufficient amount of detail

2070
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,480
thanks for that um my question is uh i

2071
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,440
mean how does this relate to the

2072
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,080
act and the working group crafted act

2073
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,159
and document that we have so my

2074
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:12,400
understanding is that

2075
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,440
it also talks about using the same set

2076
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,159
of data models service data models

2077
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:20,239
network data models

2078
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:21,679
and others that we have currently

2079
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:22,880
defined

2080
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,719
it has the same motivation it's trying

2081
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,120
to cater to the same use cases so

2082
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,800
how do you see this document related to

2083
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,560
that to that document

2084
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,120
well i i see probably acdn is an example

2085
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,520
of how to realize this with a specific

2086
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:38,000
architecture no probably this

2087
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
could intend to be a little bit more

2088
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,440
abstract so

2089
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,280
maybe we could go with the actino with

2090
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,320
other kind of of solution or framework

2091
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,239
solution i guess

2092
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,320
but certainly there are common some

2093
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,760
commonalities

2094
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,239
because i mean the architectures are

2095
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:56,239
yeah i mean scpn is a kind of

2096
01:24:56,239 --> 01:24:58,320
realization of an overall architecture

2097
01:24:58,320 --> 01:24:59,520
right

2098
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,440
so we can start another well it sounds

2099
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:03,199
like a list discussion

2100
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:06,159
we should move on

2101
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,600
yeah

2102
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,239
one quick question in the yang mapping

2103
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,920
there is one more document i'll put the

2104
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,560
link in the chat uh that document talks

2105
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,360
about mapping ipf network slices to

2106
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,320
l2 nm as well as team mapping in the

2107
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,400
same way how we did the t service

2108
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,360
mapping so that document already exists

2109
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,960
and i think i can just look at it and

2110
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,800
maybe you can add it in your list of

2111
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,280
young models there thank you

2112
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,600
thank you

2113
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,520
yeah so if you could go on to the next

2114
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,840
uh the next and maybe talk five minutes

2115
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,280
i don't know if you can keep it to five

2116
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,120
yes sorry i will be trying to be faster

2117
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,080
here so yeah this other document intends

2118
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,320
to go in the direction of understanding

2119
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,880
how we could map uh different slices

2120
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,719
right so probably could go in in the

2121
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:06,239
direction mentioned before about an

2122
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:08,719
example of realization and that

2123
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,280
so here we explore the way on how to

2124
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,360
connect 3dbps license through itf

2125
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,440
network slide services and this is done

2126
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,000
with ivan vickoff from ribbon and i'm my

2127
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,159
colleague jose erdogan from telefonica

2128
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:21,280
so

2129
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,080
the motivation is somehow 3dpp as one of

2130
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,159
the potential use cases is defining the

2131
01:26:26,159 --> 01:26:28,880
concept of slicing having a number of

2132
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,199
different logical constructs and trying

2133
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,600
to create this idea of slides with a

2134
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,560
particular qs characteristics

2135
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,400
on the other hand we have the ip all the

2136
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,040
idf network slice stuff that i will not

2137
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,199
comment so the objective is on how to

2138
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:45,520
understand how both

2139
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,440
ideas could match at the point of

2140
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,440
development that they have today in

2141
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,080
either 3gpp and its

2142
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,199
so

2143
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,400
just for for understanding cpp

2144
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,400
in the definition of network slicing is

2145
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,760
defining a number of constructs right so

2146
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,679
they are defining all this idea of

2147
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,639
network slice identifiers and for

2148
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,639
doing the the realization of the slides

2149
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,120
they are defining different artifacts

2150
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,120
one artifact that somehow it determines

2151
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,639
what could be the interface to to be

2152
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,880
connected so in this case we are doing

2153
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,080
we are performing a connection between a

2154
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,120
central

2155
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,800
center unit a user plane one with a upf

2156
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,040
one and we could have different kind of

2157
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,960
slices with different eq requirements

2158
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,639
but once for a has mobile profile

2159
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:32,560
another one from url

2160
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,120
so the way of distinguishing this kind

2161
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,280
of slices is through the artifacts that

2162
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,800
you can see that the endpoint is

2163
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,560
determining the kind of interface of the

2164
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,320
ndg ngu

2165
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,560
or the m3 interface and then they define

2166
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,880
a another artifact which is called ep

2167
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,940
transport pcb transport has a number of

2168
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:52,080
[Music]

2169
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,880
parameters that we will comment later on

2170
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,880
and we could have connection between ep

2171
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,120
transfer for realizing the slice at 3bp

2172
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:01,360
level but also as in the case at the

2173
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,120
bottom we could have even

2174
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:06,000
components of 3gbp like the ubf number 3

2175
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,239
that does not support slicing so

2176
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,960
this is somehow options that 3epp is

2177
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,960
considering and he's defining so the

2178
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,560
idea would be okay this is a certain

2179
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,880
point this is what 3ebp needs and

2180
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,840
requires how we could map this into ipf

2181
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,920
networks license so let's look

2182
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,719
what eptransport is defining if the

2183
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,080
transport is considering a number of

2184
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,239
parameters the ip address which is a

2185
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,639
mandatory parameter and it's stated as

2186
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:34,239
ipv4 or ipv6 then the logic interface

2187
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:36,480
info which is mandatory as well and they

2188
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:38,880
define a type and interface id this

2189
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,400
would correspond coming back just one

2190
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:43,040
second this will correspond to the vlan

2191
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,960
2 or vlan 1 that you can see the ap

2192
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,400
transport in the figure so we have the

2193
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,480
ip address and we have the vlan the

2194
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:50,320
billing will be the interface type and

2195
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,080
the device id the the number of the

2196
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:52,960
billing

2197
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,199
then we have a two optional parameters

2198
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,040
the lens hook info that will refer to

2199
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,280
the english transport node in case the

2200
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,280
three epp knows about this ingredient

2201
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,199
transport node and then the keyos

2202
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:05,440
profile which is also optional and could

2203
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:07,440
be provision on that logical interface

2204
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,239
in the 3dbp

2205
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,639
and then the application reference which

2206
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,480
is mandatory and essentially refers to

2207
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,239
the interface

2208
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:18,959
to the interface

2209
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,120
so a preliminary exercise with it for

2210
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,800
considering these different parameters

2211
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,320
was to create this kind of table to

2212
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,840
understand what could be how we could

2213
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,760
play with these different parameters in

2214
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,960
order to

2215
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,000
map it into a slice this is also working

2216
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,360
progress probably it's not complete at

2217
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,719
all but it's just to consider the

2218
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,800
different capability possibilities that

2219
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,440
we could have in order to uh yeah to

2220
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,719
realize that the slice probably this

2221
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:44,880
link a little bit with what being was

2222
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,480
commented before about this

2223
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,400
multiplexing and how to consider the

2224
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:50,080
multiplexing with the different

2225
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,679
identifiers

2226
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:52,480
so

2227
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:54,080
then we have

2228
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,239
the

2229
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,519
this eb transport

2230
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,679
so we have that eb transport and then we

2231
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:07,199
have somehow two different concerns the

2232
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,199
3dpp concern that this what we saw in

2233
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:11,679
the figure before with those slices and

2234
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:13,760
so and then on the the bottom part we

2235
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,679
have the itf concern

2236
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,159
and we need to perform so how do kind of

2237
01:30:18,159 --> 01:30:20,320
mappings the mapping from the ep

2238
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,080
transport and all the three

2239
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,960
three epp concerns towards the itf

2240
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:27,679
network slice and the ce part

2241
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:29,280
which we really the part that is

2242
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,040
understood by the three epp as a

2243
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,080
customer

2244
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:34,080
and then the mapping between the ce side

2245
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,800
and the pe side in the negative

2246
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,600
part in the atf network size part okay

2247
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,000
so the first one um

2248
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,639
is a mapping that could be natural if we

2249
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,840
have probably one of

2250
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,600
them physical solutions physical devices

2251
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,960
because we could leverage on the ip

2252
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,880
address and so probably it's not so

2253
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,280
clear how to perform that in a case of

2254
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,840
virtualization right and in the case of

2255
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,639
uh the atf bar in the itf concern this

2256
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,800
is all the stuff that has been defined

2257
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:03,600
in the

2258
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,120
framework document so so we could

2259
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,440
leverage on that the uh

2260
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,199
work for for identifying what could be

2261
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:09,840
the

2262
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,400
this uh i mean what can we do at that

2263
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,639
level so the idea would be to elaborate

2264
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,639
more on how we could do

2265
01:31:16,639 --> 01:31:18,639
how we could perform these mappings to

2266
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,000
have a clear idea of how we could

2267
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,040
realize

2268
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,280
these lines okay

2269
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:24,480
so

2270
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,719
in the draft there is a a section for

2271
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:28,000
discussion

2272
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,440
you're out of time i'm sorry

2273
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:35,280
so just for finishing next steps

2274
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,400
okay so we intend to prepare a more

2275
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,719
detailed document for next itf so the

2276
01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:42,080
idea would be to call a feedback from a

2277
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,280
radio thank you

2278
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,280
let's try to get the two super quick

2279
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,239
comments

2280
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,000
from and shusang yeah well mandrix

2281
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,159
one thing that i had is it seems that

2282
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,080
would it not be useful for itf to

2283
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:56,239
actually influence the parameters that

2284
01:31:56,239 --> 01:31:59,199
can be used from let's say on the 3dp

2285
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:01,840
interface between itf side and the radio

2286
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:03,600
and the 3gbp site

2287
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,000
to influence which parameters we believe

2288
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,239
are interesting from our site

2289
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:10,400
rather than them just using some of them

2290
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,639
because i see vlog being used personally

2291
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:14,639
i believe flow label for agriv6 would be

2292
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:17,280
another nice attribute that we could use

2293
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,719
and maybe there is others so i think it

2294
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,120
would be good that we try to influence

2295
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,960
what we would like to have

2296
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,280
and try to build a liaison with treat

2297
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:27,120
the people eventually on this side this

2298
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:29,360
is our idea yeah we are working also in

2299
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,759
that front

2300
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:41,840
for our presentation this is just my way

2301
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,800
and we also have a similar

2302
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,800
document

2303
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,360
we can hear you

2304
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:25,840
uh shusang we really couldn't hear you

2305
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,320
uh jay if you're coming in for the

2306
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:30,159
previous presentation can you take it to

2307
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,920
the list if you're coming in to present

2308
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,400
instead of robin uh why don't you two

2309
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,839
tell me who's presenting

2310
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,880
hello can you hear me

2311
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,480
we hear you fine

2312
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,120
okay yeah and you should uh

2313
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,239
you should have controls um

2314
01:33:52,239 --> 01:33:53,520
uh

2315
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,360
you should have controls

2316
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,920
and during your presentation we'd really

2317
01:33:57,920 --> 01:33:59,440
like to

2318
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:00,800
uh

2319
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,520
hear about if you took the action from

2320
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,960
the last meeting

2321
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,480
where we asked to take a look at the

2322
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,800
existing framework and propose text

2323
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,920
there rather than having a stand-alone

2324
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,360
document i don't believe we saw a

2325
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,199
response on the list so it's really like

2326
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,880
that point to be addressed from the last

2327
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:19,920
meeting as you talk thank you

2328
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:20,800
okay

2329
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,679
great okay i also would like this one

2330
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:26,239
this is jamie from huawei i will talk

2331
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:28,480
about this the framework of

2332
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,480
for the end to end the ietf network

2333
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:35,040
slicing okay next slide

2334
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,800
next one holes at the bottom of your

2335
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,360
screen next underneath the

2336
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,360
slides

2337
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,679
okay so i will this

2338
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,560
uh ietl network slicing framework

2339
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,840
includes two parts one is the 5g

2340
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,400
under 200 network slicing

2341
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,600
as the second one is the for the

2342
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,480
itr network slicing there's the intel

2343
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:11,320
domain network sizing work

2344
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:16,880
okay so here this is the journey for the

2345
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,040
uh network slicing work

2346
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,760
at the beginning this is the sr-based

2347
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,880
networth rising realization now this is

2348
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,600
the talk about this scalable itm network

2349
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,000
slice realization based on the

2350
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,639
decoupling the topology and the resource

2351
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,159
for the network slicing and this draft

2352
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,040
for the encapsulated the

2353
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:42,480
vpn and the vtid in the ipv secretary

2354
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:44,800
plan has been adopted

2355
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,480
by the working group

2356
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:50,719
so i think this is also the base for the

2357
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:53,520
for us to go on to move to the end to

2358
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,040
end itr network slice realization this

2359
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,080
is

2360
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,360
this framework draft

2361
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:07,040
okay so here we can see that this is the

2362
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,440
framework for the end to end so there's

2363
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,880
the uh the 5g and to end the network

2364
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,560
slicing they'll use the iss ai to

2365
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,119
identify this the network

2366
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,719
uh for for

2367
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:23,760
identify the uh under to end the 5g

2368
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:25,920
network slice

2369
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:28,880
and also this in the for the transporter

2370
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,520
network there's the multi domain so

2371
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:34,239
there's we also have this the intel

2372
01:36:34,239 --> 01:36:38,400
domain ietf network slicing work so at

2373
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,600
the beginning we use vtune as the

2374
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,639
terminology but according to the latest

2375
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,360
progress of the ietf networks license

2376
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,679
architecture document

2377
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,159
our draft is aligned with this

2378
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:55,760
architecture we use an rp as this is the

2379
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,320
terminology that means the network

2380
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:01,199
resource partition so this

2381
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:03,840
this is just this is the update

2382
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:06,840
okay

2383
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,920
okay so here this we also use the change

2384
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,800
this terminology we use as the

2385
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,760
local domain rpid

2386
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,920
to indicate this the identifier for the

2387
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:24,639
resource uh for the specific uh network

2388
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,239
resource partition

2389
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:29,280
and also we had this the global this

2390
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:32,239
rpid to represent the

2391
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,719
global this is the network resource

2392
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,080
partition resource uh this is the second

2393
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,440
one and then this is the for the 5g and

2394
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:45,280
the network slicer id is not a change we

2395
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:48,320
also think that's the ssi

2396
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,800
can be encapsulated in the forwarding

2397
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,600
plane and can be mapped to the

2398
01:37:53,600 --> 01:38:01,080
u2e rpid or the local domain rpid okay

2399
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,320
okay so this is the just this is the

2400
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,760
requirements

2401
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,400
about this wire so this in fact this

2402
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,679
will not change much but this is the uh

2403
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:16,880
this is refined this is the process

2404
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:19,520
uh especially that's in the

2405
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,719
other edge of this the

2406
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,440
ietf network slicing domain

2407
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,119
there's a need

2408
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:28,719
to support

2409
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:32,960
map the 5g network size id to the global

2410
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:36,320
rpid and the domain and rpid

2411
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,440
and also for the transport network

2412
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:42,239
domain and the domain border nodes

2413
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:45,920
should support to map the global rpid to

2414
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:49,840
the domain rpid of the local domain

2415
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,159
so this is just to

2416
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:55,760
implement the undertool under mapping

2417
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:56,840
between the

2418
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,800
5g network slicing to the ietv network

2419
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:02,080
slicing

2420
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,880
and

2421
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,159
between the

2422
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:05,600
global

2423
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,480
this rpid to the local domain rpid

2424
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,960
similar and for the management and the

2425
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,760
control plane it should be

2426
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,320
through the protocol uh control protocol

2427
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:21,360
extension or this linear model

2428
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,320
to

2429
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,880
implement the mapping

2430
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,960
at the edge node

2431
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:28,239
for the

2432
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:31,520
for the transporter edge devices

2433
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,280
all this the

2434
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,800
uh

2435
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,440
all this the azure device of the each

2436
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,880
domain so this for the implemented map

2437
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,679
here okay

2438
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,639
okay so this is just this is the summary

2439
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,000
of the updates

2440
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,639
so that's align the terminology with the

2441
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,199
ietl network slice and the vpn plus

2442
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:56,320
draft

2443
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,600
and also revise this text about the data

2444
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,920
plane requirements and also do some of

2445
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,520
these editorial

2446
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:07,480
changes okay

2447
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,600
okay so this is just our this is the

2448
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,080
step let's solicit the comments and go

2449
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:17,600
on to refine this draft okay

2450
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:20,159
okay that's

2451
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,600
all okay thank you uh we're letting late

2452
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,440
we don't really have time for questions

2453
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,600
or comments please take them to the list

2454
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,920
again this is a super super short

2455
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,920
document it's what two or three pages of

2456
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,159
content would be great to see if you

2457
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,679
could figure out if there's an existing

2458
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:36,719
document

2459
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,159
you could combine it with particularly a

2460
01:40:38,159 --> 01:40:40,080
working group document just send email

2461
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,719
the list proposing uh content for the

2462
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,719
for an existing document

2463
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,159
thank you

2464
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:49,719
okay thank you

2465
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,480
so next up we have jay

2466
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:05,839
uh sorry

2467
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,440
okay

2468
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,719
hello again

2469
01:41:12,719 --> 01:41:14,480
this is a

2470
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,719
presentation about the considerations

2471
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:18,400
about hierarchical idea of natural

2472
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,719
slices

2473
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:23,679
okay next page

2474
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:25,280
here are the backgrounds i think the

2475
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,840
hierarchical network slicing is briefly

2476
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,000
mentioned in the item number slice frame

2477
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,199
of draft

2478
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,040
as below

2479
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,280
ideologue slides can be further sliced

2480
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,520
into other natural slices and recursive

2481
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,520
composition allows

2482
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,600
another slice and one layer to be used

2483
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,840
by another layer slice

2484
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,280
and but there's no details about how the

2485
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,960
hierarchical natural slides can be

2486
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,520
realized so this document first

2487
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,199
describes some

2488
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,199
typical use cases of the hierarchical

2489
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,480
natural slice

2490
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,199
and it also provides the considerations

2491
01:41:59,199 --> 01:42:00,400
and the requirements about the

2492
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,639
technologies that can be used for the

2493
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,480
narrowest hierarchical network

2494
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,040
realization in different natural planes

2495
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:13,600
okay here we show some typical

2496
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,520
use cases of the hierarchical iot of

2497
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:16,960
network slides

2498
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,199
like the first one is

2499
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,040
multiple customer

2500
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,719
level network slices

2501
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,040
can be created in an industrial network

2502
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,920
slice as shown the first level is can be

2503
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,239
an education network slice

2504
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,320
and at the second level there can be

2505
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,639
multiple other slices for different

2506
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,320
universities

2507
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,320
and in the second case there can be

2508
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,600
multiple

2509
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,600
application network slices in the

2510
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:44,080
customer natural slice

2511
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,840
for example

2512
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,560
in hospital network slides there can be

2513
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,440
different network slices for different

2514
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,719
types of medical services

2515
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:57,119
and the last one is about a wholesale

2516
01:42:57,119 --> 01:42:59,520
scenario in which a wholesale network

2517
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:02,000
slice can be requested to further

2518
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,440
provide a

2519
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:07,040
customer another slices for the services

2520
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,719
in this case the whole scenario slice is

2521
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,040
the level one slice and there can be

2522
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,080
multiple custom natural slices

2523
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,480
as a level two slice in this

2524
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,440
level one slice

2525
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,199
okay

2526
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:25,840
so following some slides we will show

2527
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:27,600
some considerations about the

2528
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,960
hierarchical network slice realization

2529
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,360
the first one is about the resource

2530
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,760
partitioning in the forwarding plane

2531
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,920
because uh since we want to support

2532
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,800
hierarchical slides uh the nrp in

2533
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,000
underlay

2534
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,320
are used to support one or multiple

2535
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,880
slide services and for the hierarchical

2536
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:49,119
slicing scenario the forwarding planning

2537
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:50,880
resources need to be

2538
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:53,280
able to be partitioned in a hierarchical

2539
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:54,239
manner

2540
01:43:54,239 --> 01:43:56,719
and we need to show the different levels

2541
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,719
of an rps in the network and to the

2542
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,960
up layer planes like the control plane

2543
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,880
and data plane

2544
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,400
there's two options

2545
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,560
about how to modeling the

2546
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:11,199
hierarchical nrps at the link resource

2547
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:12,080
level

2548
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,719
the first one is uh we can treat uh the

2549
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:17,440
level one slice resource partition on

2550
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:20,800
the link as a layer three sub-interface

2551
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,000
and for the second level uh nrp resource

2552
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,960
can can be treated as the separate data

2553
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,280
channels within the layers research

2554
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:31,119
interface

2555
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:33,360
the second option is we can treat

2556
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:34,880
different uh

2557
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,520
level ones network slices as a layer two

2558
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,119
sub interfaces

2559
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:42,000
and for the level two uh uh network

2560
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,560
slices the resource partition can be

2561
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,320
considered as the data channel within

2562
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,600
each level layer two sub-interfaces

2563
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:52,239
so these different options uh can have

2564
01:44:52,239 --> 01:44:54,480
bring different impacts to the control

2565
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:57,840
plane and manage plane in terms of the

2566
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:59,760
navigation management and also the

2567
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,840
information distribution to the network

2568
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,000
the second consideration is about the

2569
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,320
data identification of the hierarchical

2570
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:11,920
in rpgs

2571
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,480
because we need to use the identifier in

2572
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,480
the data the package

2573
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:21,040
uh to identify both the levels of nrps

2574
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:24,159
there are also two options of this uh

2575
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,480
identifying the data plane

2576
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,119
the first option is we can use a unified

2577
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,480
nrp id

2578
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,679
for both hierarchical hierarchies

2579
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:35,760
that is uh

2580
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:37,600
both the first level nrp and the second

2581
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:39,679
level and rp use the same format of the

2582
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:41,600
identifier but

2583
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:43,840
using the different identifier values to

2584
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,639
distinguish the traffic for the first

2585
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,520
level or the second level

2586
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,520
the second option is we

2587
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,360
may choose to use a hierarchical

2588
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:55,840
identifier for both the first level and

2589
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:57,840
the second level in our

2590
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,360
and they can be

2591
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:00,960
uh the two

2592
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,800
uh level nfp ids may be carried in the

2593
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,360
continuous fields in the package or they

2594
01:46:07,360 --> 01:46:09,920
can be carried in separate fields as

2595
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:12,639
long as you can use them to match this

2596
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,719
first level nrp and the second level nrp

2597
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,440
separately

2598
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,440
here are also some

2599
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,440
considerations about the control plane

2600
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,520
and the data plane and management plane

2601
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,760
sorry there's a tempo

2602
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,679
the first size at the control plane may

2603
01:46:31,679 --> 01:46:33,600
need to be used for the distribution of

2604
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,080
the information and the status of the

2605
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,159
hierarchical inner peace

2606
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,000
both among the natural nodes and also to

2607
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,440
the controllers

2608
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:42,400
so

2609
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:45,199
with different nrp resource modeling as

2610
01:46:45,199 --> 01:46:47,280
mentioned in the previous slides this

2611
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:50,239
information may be advertised as a

2612
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,080
later three or later information to the

2613
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,400
network and this can have different

2614
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,560
functionality and scalability

2615
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:59,760
implications to the control plane

2616
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,440
and as the number of the hierarchical

2617
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,600
network slides increases uh we also need

2618
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:05,679
to consider the control plane

2619
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,320
optimizations to support the better

2620
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,880
scalability

2621
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:12,639
in terms of the management plan

2622
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:14,560
functions uh for the hierarchical

2623
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,239
network slicing

2624
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,719
the management plan need to provide a

2625
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:21,199
life cycle management both to the first

2626
01:47:21,199 --> 01:47:24,080
level never slices and the second level

2627
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,080
never slices

2628
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,639
it should allow to manage the

2629
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:30,239
different levels of nano slices

2630
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:31,520
separately

2631
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:33,520
and it also need to

2632
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,679
have this information about the

2633
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:37,360
relationship between these two level

2634
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:39,760
network slices maintained in that in the

2635
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,800
management system

2636
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,440
okay

2637
01:47:47,440 --> 01:47:50,080
for the next steps we would like to get

2638
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,639
some feedbacks and comments about this

2639
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,960
hierarchical network slides both about

2640
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,480
the possible use cases and the

2641
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,679
requirements

2642
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:58,800
also some

2643
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:00,480
further considerations about the

2644
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:02,239
realization of hierarchical network

2645
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,320
slicing

2646
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:07,599
okay that's all

2647
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,080
well thank you very much uh look forward

2648
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:13,920
to the input and also thank you for

2649
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,760
going short you've actually put us back

2650
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,760
on time so

2651
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:21,000
that's awesome

2652
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:39,920
all right

2653
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,000
if you could unmute your mic

2654
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,760
you should be able to start talking

2655
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:02,159
we can't hear you

2656
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:09,040
it says you are muted

2657
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,800
if you don't have a mute button hit

2658
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,480
reload on your browser that seems to

2659
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:15,839
have happened to a few people today

2660
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,199
i don't know if there's someone else who

2661
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:34,800
could present

2662
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:35,679
uh

2663
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,080
g can you play present thing

2664
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,880
i see you listed as a co-author

2665
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,800
yeah

2666
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,599
this is g again i think uh gibral has

2667
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:48,000
some issue with the mic so i will

2668
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,440
present this uh slice on behalf of him

2669
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,679
also this is uh

2670
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,239
it's not even showing them as trying to

2671
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:58,159
trying to speak so it's something on the

2672
01:49:58,159 --> 01:49:59,760
browser interface

2673
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,360
if you can hear me

2674
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:03,199
just reload your browser and see if you

2675
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:06,159
can then uh re-enter and until then

2676
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:07,760
if you don't mind

2677
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,040
thank you

2678
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,679
you mean to ask the trooper to try again

2679
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:13,760
i know i i think i just did hopefully

2680
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,760
hears me but that you could just start

2681
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,800
presenting while we're waiting

2682
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,199
okay

2683
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,840
if it's

2684
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,280
okay so let me

2685
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,040
try to present on behalf of me

2686
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:32,719
so this is uh

2687
01:50:32,719 --> 01:50:34,159
some deployment status and

2688
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:36,320
considerations about the itf network

2689
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,520
slices

2690
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,000
in some operators networks

2691
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,760
i'm presenting on behalf of this

2692
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:44,080
coursers from the operators

2693
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,400
okay

2694
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,119
so ah this is the introduction using

2695
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:53,119
nether slicing can be used to provide

2696
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:55,040
different services and customers with

2697
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:57,679
the required connectivity resource and

2698
01:50:57,679 --> 01:50:59,840
performance characteristics

2699
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:01,360
so

2700
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,159
since item network slides draft describe

2701
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,159
the concept and general framework of

2702
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,400
network idf network slice and the

2703
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,040
realization mechanism and connected

2704
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,719
technologies are

2705
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,040
being discussed and described in the has

2706
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,119
vpn framework draft

2707
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:20,080
so this document provides some typical

2708
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,480
deployment cases of the item number

2709
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,880
slice in operators network based on the

2710
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:27,040
bim plus technologies

2711
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,480
uh it also will provide some

2712
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,719
considerations about the next steps that

2713
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:33,679
operators things will need to be follow

2714
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,040
for another slice deployment

2715
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,760
okay next

2716
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,840
thing

2717
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,400
this is the first case uh to use network

2718
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:46,639
slicing for multi intel industrial

2719
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:49,040
networks now in this case

2720
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,520
this operator

2721
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,000
china telecom nisha

2722
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,639
they have a dedicated israel sex-based

2723
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,560
network for multiple industry services

2724
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,119
currently this network carries the three

2725
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:06,000
major types of service the healthcare

2726
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,239
education and the

2727
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:11,040
um the enterprise internet service and

2728
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:13,360
they're planning to introduce more

2729
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:15,440
vertical industry services into this

2730
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,719
network

2731
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:17,599
so

2732
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:20,080
for this new network they create a

2733
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:23,599
separate uh like vtns or an rp's

2734
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:25,599
with different natural resources but

2735
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,639
these resources partitioned

2736
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:30,400
the technology used for research

2737
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:32,719
partitioning is based on virtual sub

2738
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,520
interfaces with dedicated bandwidths

2739
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,440
and in the data plane they're using the

2740
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,880
srv6

2741
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,000
assist to identify different

2742
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
resource partitions on the interfaces

2743
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,440
and the nodes

2744
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,440
in the control plane mechanism used here

2745
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:50,320
is using as a policy with link affinity

2746
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:51,599
as constraints

2747
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,679
for the as a policy pass computation

2748
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,679
for this network uh operators

2749
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:01,119
notice that

2750
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,840
with this as a policy-based mechanism to

2751
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:06,560
achieve any to any connections it will

2752
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,960
require a large number of isa policies

2753
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:10,000
being

2754
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,239
provisioned on the network like full

2755
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:14,960
mesh as a policy provisioning

2756
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,440
and for this kind of uh i need any

2757
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:19,520
connection they are considering to

2758
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:21,440
introduce optimize the mechanism to

2759
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:22,480
support

2760
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:26,639
srv6 best effort based network slicing

2761
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,480
in the next step

2762
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,760
also

2763
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,760
as the number of the narrow slides will

2764
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,840
increase in the future

2765
01:53:33,840 --> 01:53:35,920
to improve the scalability

2766
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:39,199
the plans to introduce the data plane

2767
01:53:39,199 --> 01:53:41,360
between resource id

2768
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,400
to the network slice so that it can

2769
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
reduce the amount of information to be

2770
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,159
distributed in the control plane and

2771
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,960
also to help to

2772
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,599
reduce the number of the folding

2773
01:53:53,599 --> 01:53:56,159
entries in the data plane

2774
01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:59,199
the third consideration is since the the

2775
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:02,000
industrial network slices within each

2776
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,159
industrial slice there will be a per

2777
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:06,480
custom ladder slice introduced in the

2778
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,480
future so the hierarchical network

2779
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,960
slicing solution will be considered as a

2780
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:13,520
next step

2781
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:18,080
next slide please

2782
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:22,880
okay this one is another use case of the

2783
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,880
network slicing for the fixed mobile

2784
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,320
convergence network basically this is a

2785
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,960
operator using network slicing to

2786
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,480
provide a separate separation and the

2787
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:36,560
resource isolation between

2788
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:38,480
the mobile service

2789
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,800
enterprise uh proving line service and

2790
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:42,960
the broadband in network internet

2791
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,080
service

2792
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:45,840
in the same network

2793
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:48,639
and in this case they're using srm peris

2794
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,159
as a data playing

2795
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:52,320
mechanism and resource partitioning is

2796
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,480
based on flexible internet

2797
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,239
and the virtual sub-interface with

2798
01:54:56,239 --> 01:54:58,719
dedicated bandwidth

2799
01:54:58,719 --> 01:55:00,480
for the control plane it's

2800
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,560
also used as a policy with the link

2801
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:05,520
affinity as a constraint

2802
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,920
for this operator

2803
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,239
consider that the automatic network

2804
01:55:10,239 --> 01:55:12,080
slice management operation is an

2805
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:13,840
important feature

2806
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,400
to reduce the operational

2807
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:19,840
operational overhead and complexity

2808
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:22,080
introduced by network slicing so this is

2809
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,199
a very useful tool and they want more

2810
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,760
improvement with this automation

2811
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:29,360
capability

2812
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,159
and

2813
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:32,400
the second thing uh because they

2814
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,440
consider for the next step is uh

2815
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,440
since uh the number of the next slides

2816
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,920
will increase in this network they're

2817
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:42,400
considered to even evolve towards a high

2818
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:45,599
speed scalability never slicing solution

2819
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,760
in the future probably they will also

2820
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:50,560
need to consider to to introduce the

2821
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,960
slash id mechanism

2822
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,199
right

2823
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:58,480
next slide please

2824
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,960
okay

2825
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,400
the next step is we would like to

2826
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,760
collect some

2827
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,440
comments feedbacks from the working

2828
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:06,239
group

2829
01:56:06,239 --> 01:56:08,239
and we will plan to add more network

2830
01:56:08,239 --> 01:56:10,880
slice deployment cases and information

2831
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,840
to the draft in the

2832
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,360
future okay

2833
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:17,759
thank you

2834
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:27,000
comment for questions

2835
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:29,840
yeah for me it's very interesting to see

2836
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:32,239
this and i appreciate the uh being

2837
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:35,440
brought into the itf uh so uh thank you

2838
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,440
uh all the authors and apologies to the

2839
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:38,560
person

2840
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,440
uh

2841
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,239
uh

2842
01:56:40,239 --> 01:56:42,960
who couldn't get this uh mic working

2843
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:45,280
we've had a lot of that today

2844
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:49,360
uh any other uh comments or questions we

2845
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:51,440
have a minute or two if someone wants to

2846
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,800
bring up something from earlier in the

2847
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,080
session

2848
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:57,840
uh please go ahead

2849
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:00,400
yes

2850

yes okay uh the the just finished the

2851
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:06,480
presentation uh i want to know

2852
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:09,440
for the cases i presented here

2853
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,839
are those

2854
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:15,520
real cases deploying already or just

2855
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,480
still

2856
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,080
paper based cases

2857
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,320
thank you

2858
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:23,520
they're real deployments

2859
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,760
okay thank you

2860
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,000
thank you

2861
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:41,520
okay

okay thank you

2863
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:46,080
thank you

2864
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:51,360
so thanks everyone thanks everyone for

2865
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,760
two very productive sessions uh

2866
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,679
hope to see you all in philly in july

2867
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:56,880
hope to see you

2868
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:59,679
uh all in person uh as many as a few as

2869
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:02,080
possible

2870
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:02,960
hello

2871
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:04,400
