32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
i've done

33
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
so let me end the chair i'm just

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,239
clicking the share icon directly to the

35
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
right of the join q hand

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
yeah it's not loading the right chair

37
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,840
slides

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,238
all right what browser are you using

39
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
uh firefox

40
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,079
same

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
seems to be the old slide decks

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
even if i refresh them it's not

43
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,559
uploading the right slides

44
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
they auto loaded them if and they pulled

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
the list beforehand if you change the

46
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
slides at the last minute they could

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
easily have autoloaded the wrong slide

48
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
you need to then go in

49
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,759
delete the slide deck

50
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,240
pull add slide deck and the

51
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
tool button and the tool icon manage

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
slides

53
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
yeah the meeting materials

54
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,840
is showing the right set of slide text

55
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,000
reloading reloading them let's see

56
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,720
okay you do you want to try sharing your

57
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,199
screen

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,919
if you have the slide deck in front of

59
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,919
you

60
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,000

going to

102
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,920
now switch to the pre-loaded slide

103
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,160
screen

104
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,160

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,240
thank you chair

109
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,080
and this is shooking i'm going to

110
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,720
present this uh ap flows back next

111
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
please

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,240
since we have presented a few times in

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,120
this meeting and we have official wiki

114
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,399
and without the epm active drafts so you

115
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
could refer to so here escape the

116
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,440
introduction of the apn

117
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,640
and for the flowspack we define a new

118
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
flowspace component apid and here is we

119
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
use the lens to indicate the

120
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,120
mask and ap id lens and we use the mask

121
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,320
to indicate the base of the apn id that

122
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,079
needs to be matched

123
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
and here we give an example for example

124
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,920
the apn id there are two parts and the

125
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,079
group id app group id and user group id

126
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,920
and in the mask we have the base

127
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
which uh here you could see that it's

128
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
actually

129
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,720
indicates the parts of the app group id

130
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,200
and when it is matched

131
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
the app group id in the float space

132
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,000
we lost you

133
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,279
so

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,279
are you there

135
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,279
yes can you hear me now

136
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,079
yes much better please continue okay yes

137
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,720
so and when it's matched that that means

138
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,399
a successful match

139
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,279
and next at least

140
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
yes here we define four traffic

141
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
filtering actions

142
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,279
and here i used figures the diagrams to

143
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,160
show the first one the marking actually

144
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
we this one can be used to mark the

145
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,680
entire ap id which can be encapsulated

146
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,399
in the uh the

147
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,600
packets and here the second one is used

148
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,320
to

149
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
to uh match the

150
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
the mark to mark the partial parts of

151
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,639
the apn id which is carried in the float

152
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
spec and the the third one is used for

153
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,200
inherit the pin id which was carried in

154
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,079
the original package and that means when

155
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,240
you want to copy and

156
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
encapsulate the ap id in the outer

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,560
tunnel header and then for the

158
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,920
third one the fourth one is we use that

159
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,519
for the stitching

160
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,240
and that means you will get part of

161
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,120
typing id from the original package and

162
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
then stitch with the one the part of the

163
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,120
ap id in the flows back

164
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,839
next please

165
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,440
and here

166
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
there are some it is about the ordering

167
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,800
and organizations of the flow spec for

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,079
apn because we found two things one is

169
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,800
that there is not only the flows back

170
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,440
rules for apn and there are also other

171
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,800
rules so they will be co-existing

172
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
and the second is that uh

173
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,399
the ap id has different parts and for

174
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,720
each part that can be determined by

175
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
different

176
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,880
flow spec rules so considering that

177
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
these two

178
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,160
consider

179
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,839
conditions and here

180
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,040
we we defined is um

181
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,360
[Music]

182
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,399
two

183
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
two categories one is sub group id

184
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,480
and

185
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
the other one is a group id and for all

186
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
the ap and float back rules we put it

187
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
into one group and use the group id to

188
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,880
indicate that

189
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
and for others we put we could put the

190
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,120
rules into another groups

191
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,600
and for the subgroup

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,320
for each subgroup we use it to contain

193
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,040
the rules for a specific part of the

194
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,639
apid so here we also give the uses

195
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,079
principles

196
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,639
so within a subgroup

197
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
that is uh

198
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,560
the same as what we have already defined

199
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
so this

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
i i want to

201
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,399
repeat and for between between

202
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,199
some groups that because each subgroup

203
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,680
is ordered with id

204
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,279
and if the evaluation in one sub group

205
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
stops or finished

206
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,240
it will

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
start the evaluation in the following

208
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
subgroup

209
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
if there is any left

210
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
and between the group set

211
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,639
so the group is ordered with the group

212
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,519
id

213
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,920
and if at least the one condition in

214
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,760
this group is matched

215
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
and when the

216
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,040
evaluation reached to the end

217
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,240
it won't

218
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,440
continue the evaluation will stop

219
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,720
okay so

220
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
i think that is all

221
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,120
next

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
yeah

223
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
so do you have any questions or comments

224
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,720
thank you

225
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
jeff you have the mic

226
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,600
thanks for the presentation too common

227
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,839
first one is that this feature will

228
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,800
require spec v2 we currently have no way

229
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,920
to extend flowspec v1

230
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
second comment is the ordering for your

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
group and subgroup may need further

232
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
discussion

233
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,040
uh there's gonna be discussion about how

234
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,519
rules are ordered in flow spec v2 and

235
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
you'll want to make sure that

236
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
you pay attention to that discussion

237
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,519
thank you

238
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
yeah sure and uh

239
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
i think this can be smoothly removed to

240
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,560
the v2 but of course we can discuss

241
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,119
about that

242
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,800
thank you so much

243
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
thank you shubang

is

247
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
uh

248
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,959

the topic like letter i am presentation

251
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
is a traffickers italian used in bgp

252
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,880
follows vector with srv6

253
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,920
six policy this is a work done by

254
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,399
several wonders is under the

255
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,759
organization of china mobile

256
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,480
next please

257
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
okay

258
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,319
this worker

259
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
has a vm presentation

260
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,119
presented at ietf

261
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,079
once vlog 105 meetings and we got a few

262
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,839
good feedback from the ieti

263
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,599
community thanks to everyone

264
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
for their use for comments and

265
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,119
suggestions

266
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
at this point

267
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
all the comments have have been

268
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,559
addressed

269
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,799
since what john and jeff's comment

270
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,679
data has been changed to

271
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,600
informational

272
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
overload is informational the

273
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
specification this library in this

274
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
document is very useful it can have a

275
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,400
unified

276
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,039
implementation across

277
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
multi-wonders

278
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
the most important update is that we

279
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
have added a second to report multi

280
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,799
implementations

281
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,918
next please

282
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,840
we have oriented this detailed solution

283
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,799
twice

284
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,760
in the past the presentations

285
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,960
under here

286
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
are some summary information

287
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,520
our basic

288
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
idea is to you

289
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,799
re reuse the components of components

290
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,880
from maltese then dark

291
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,760
documents based on

292
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,600
past comments

293
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
we add some more clear this

294
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,960
collaboration here

295
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,160
they are also described in the jobs

296
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
number one

297
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,039
and the current stage

298
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,400
this work

299
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,200
discusses how to use the flash vector to

300
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,280
match the global routine table prefix

301
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
number two

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,799
we only support the usage of one

303
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,240
redirect ip community under one color

304
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,520
community

305
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,679
how to support a multi-extended

306
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
community attribute will be discussed

307
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,320
in the

308
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,520
in the other jobs

309
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,559
next please oh no no no number three uh

310
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
both the uh intro s and the inter s use

311
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,880
case are supported

312
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,679
number four uh regarding the usage of

313
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,360
prefix attribute component we have two

314
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,400
options

315
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
if the last srv6 sid in the segment list

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
is usd flavored

317
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,520
then we can use option two

318
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
both two options

319
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
have already been supported by multi

320
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,679
wonders

321
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,480
next please

322
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,760
okay

323
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
this work

324
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,880
has been implemented by marty wonders

325
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,880
and the multiple mutations had a good

326
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,919
inter operatibility test

327
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,280
which is hosted by china mobile

328
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,480
following table shows the participating

329
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,360
wonders under the device let's pass the

330
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,400
test

331
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
uh sends to channel mobile

332
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
for putting multi wonders into a perfect

333
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,280
team

334
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
thanks to all the wonders who

335
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,720

okay

338
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,480
next next data we will update the

339
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
information implementation report to the

340
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720

that's all thank you for your attention

350
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,600
to this work

351
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,080
yes yes song you have the mic please

352
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
me

353
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
yes okay perfect okay thank you okay

354
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,799
i mean sun liu from the china mobile

355
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,840
and i want to say that currently there

356
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,240
is a lot of public network traffic in

357
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
china mobile network

358
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,280
and as a operator i think it is very

359
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,679
useful to optimize the traffic for

360
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,960
by the using the btp flow spec with the

361
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
sri 6 policy

362
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,760
and we have completed the lab into our

363
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,240
test with multiple vendors as schwein

364
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
mentioned

365
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,559
and so

366
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,799
i think it is also available for the

367
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,240
working group thank you

368
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,480
thank you

369
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,440
thank you so much

370
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,120
oh thank you

371
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,000
whim

372
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,159
you have a mic

373
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,960
you have any killer

374
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,360
post a draft but uh is a draft already

375
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,080
in idr that does something similar so i

376
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
will i will post it in in the

377
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
as an email but i think we should look

378
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,480
to see whether we can have synergies

379
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,000
between that proposal already because

380
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,679
that's already has progressed quite a

381
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
bit already

382
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,400
okay

383
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,140
thank you

384
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,559
[Music]

385
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
oh thank you

386
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
next on the agenda is uh bgp flow

387
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,799
specifications for

388
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,760
that net flow mapping

389
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,440
can you hear me

390
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,600
yes i can hear you well please

391
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
completely

392
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
okay okay thank you

393
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,799
and uh um tren show from city this is a

394
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,520
bgp flow specification for the net flow

395
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,720
mapping next slide please

396
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
so first uh we look at the update from

397
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
last version

398
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,400
we have presented at itf one one two and

399
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,880
got flip feedback from uh that led and

400
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,039
the idea working group they are very

401
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,480
appreciated first we got performance

402
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
from the lecture it is required to

403
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,720
clarify that this document is focused on

404
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,760
tsm mapping not generic does not

405
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,720
and second that the net charts are okay

406
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,520
to

407
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
work on this target in either the net or

408
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
idr

409
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,360
and we also got comments from every uh

410
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,799
it leads to be implemented to uh

411
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
in flossback version two so based on the

412
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,120
comments we changed the draft name to

413
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,480
clarify the ts tsm mapping

414
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
it is now uh is the

415
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,000
bgp flow specification for the flat and

416
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
the tsn flow mapping

417
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,799
we also changed the extensions from a

418
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,200
bhp fs version to one to uh bgp fs

419
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
version two as per the uh s divide in

420
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,320
draft health idr flows back version two

421
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,120
um

422
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,000
and we added either tsn subtree in bhp

423
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
fs version 2 l2 header gre we also add a

424
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,760
sequence action sub-tier vhp fs version

425
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
to wide community

426
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
we enter a netlist sub-qre in bgpfs

427
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,520
version 2 in

428
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
ipad or tlv

429
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
value we add tsm action sub-theory in

430
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,520
bhp fs version 2 white community

431
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,158
unless my please

432
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,440
so this is the overview with csm and

433
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,720
that

434
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,679
mapping

435
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,360
uh dividing rfc 8655.net

436
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,559
might uh provide that it means the

437
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,799
deterministic

438
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,760
service for the tsm end system and the

439
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,200
night ip and the mps flows may be

440
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,360
carried over tsm sub networks so the

441
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
pro

442
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
primary requirements of the controller

443
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,360
play for the tsn and then that flow

444
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,880
mapping is as flows the mapping between

445
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,520
tsm streams and deadline flows is

446
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,279
required for the

447
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,080
service proxy function at the led engine

448
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,760
modes and the

449
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,400
mapping table can be configured and

450
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,279
maintained in the control plane so this

451
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,919
document proposed the extensions to hpfs

452
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,919
version 2 for tsm and the net mapping by

453
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,039
using their traffic filtering rules to

454
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
identify the packet and using the

455
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,799
associated action to map the package to

456
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,960
the related service

457
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
so let's let this

458
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,320
so we first proposed the btpfs

459
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,840
extensions for tsnt3 mapping to data

460
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,799
flow

461
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,880
for the filtering rules for tsn streams

462
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,559
there are

463
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,640
a string id is a 64-bit field that

464
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
identifies the string in tsn and the

465
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,799
spring identification functions are

466
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,640
defined in actually

467
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,440
under other parameters has been uh

468
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
defined in

469
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,440
idr flows back lt2 vpn and and so this

470
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
document

471
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,159
proposed a new tsn sub-theory in

472
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,320
l2 heteroe to

473
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,279
uh

474
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,919
identify the guessing

475
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,520
string id

476
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,480
we just propose the

477
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,399
mask and match screen and a vacation

478
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,279
uh in uh for tencent uh traffic

479
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,520
filtering and for

480
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,720
traffic action uh yes for the streams

481
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
the action is to accept the tsn streams

482
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,200
and that matches the law and matter

483
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,240
streams to the net flows so

484
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,919
their action for l3 traffic

485
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,960
with extended communities has defined

486
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,399
manning parameters

487
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,880
uh in uh the bgp flows back label draft

488
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,080
so this document proposed the sequence

489
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,880
action subtree uh in uh bgpfs version

490
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
two white community

491
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,679
next slide please

492
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,600
so for the netflow mapping to tsm string

493
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,399
in bgpfs extension

494
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:15,840
for uh

495
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,679
filtering uh rules uh for tesla flows uh

496
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,480
the

497
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,760
l3

498
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,520
rings have defined and can be used for

499
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,880
net ip flow uh for example as label

500
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,760
intellect mps flow can use the filtering

501
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
rule defined in after itf ideal for spec

502
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,000
mps patch so this document uh proposed a

503
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,919
data sub tree in bhp fs version 2

504
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,559
in ip header tle

505
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,919
we just

506
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,279
defined the dcw in for the download and

507
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,399
ps4

508
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,640
for the traffic action for

509
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
that net flows

510
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,919
the extension extended action for and

511
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,120
and that traffic filtering is to

512
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
accept the tesla flows that manchester

513
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,919
the ruler and the matter flows through

514
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,640
their tests and strings so this document

515
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
proposes under psn action software

516
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
in php fs version 2 white community

517
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,600
this

518
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,240
tss provide can be

519
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
defined to

520
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
convert it to the screen related

521
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,360
parameters for example the tsn string id

522
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,520
screen handle sequence number and the

523
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
traffic scheduling function

524
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,960
next map is

525
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
this is what the extension for bgp fs

526
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,880
version two uh next slide step we would

527
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,080
like to discuss and collaborate with bgp

528
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,760
fs version two and the draft uh help idr

529
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,320
flows back version 2. so comments and

530
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
their discussions are very welcome thank

531
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,320
you

532
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
any questions

533
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
any questions

534
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,840
zoozong please go ahead

535
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,918
thank you

536
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,720
hi hi don't hear me well

537
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
yes

538
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
oh thank you this is joseon from huawei

539
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
one question for the six number because

540
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
indiana six number is used for the

541
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,000
emerge the redundancy flows

542
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,760
so i'm i'm

543
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,799
i am not quite understand why we use six

544
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,159
number as the filter of a tsn flow maybe

545
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,279
more

546
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,600
explanation or descriptions could be

547
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,000
ended here

548
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,799
yeah thank you for your comments uh we

549
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,799
will add the

550
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
description

551
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,519
in last version thank you

552
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,559
thank you so much

553
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
so the next um topic on the

554
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,159
um

555
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,600
on the

556
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,399
for the discussion is the bgp auto

557
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,840
config

558
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,519
discussions jeff

559
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,120
and sue

560
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,399
do you want to take a lead on that

561
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
jeff

562
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,919
yes i'm here

563
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,120
i don't

564
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
recall that being as part of our core

565
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,480
agenda but

566
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,519
certainly there should have been sure

567
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,559
slides to go with it if so

568
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,000
okay perfect and we'll continue

569
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,399
next on the list is then in that case

570
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,559
ls extensions

571
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,120
for our

572
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,240
sr policy extensions for the matrix

573
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,240
g

574
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,679
well i think the next one is uh

575
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,720
as a policy it flows back it goes back

576
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,519
up

577
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,880
for the

578
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,720
load balancing group on the agenda

579
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
or do you want to

580
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,799
shift them

581
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,279
it's not appearing on the

582
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,279
list

583
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,600
so

584
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,679
yeah this one

585
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,080
perfect

586
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,320
care me

587
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,600
yes i can hear you please go ahead

588
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,879
thank you

589
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,639
uh hello everyone

590
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,800
and this is

591
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,760
maui

592
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,480
today i'm going to talk about

593
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
people's back redirect load currency

594
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,000
group community

595
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,199
network is

596
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,760
first let me explain the motivation

597
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,240
because

598
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,639
traffic

599
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,800
in some scenario due to

600
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,680
as traffic

601
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,560
to

602
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,920
a lottery one from lotus zero we may

603
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,040
want to steer traffic to lottery to

604
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,599
lotus rate and load flow

605
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,079
in a ratio of one two two to two

606
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,320
and then if the controller suppose

607
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,200
detecting the network the ratio could be

608
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,160
changing according to network running

609
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
status

610
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,440
and the loaders may be deployed in ip

611
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,960
and prs or srv6

612
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,800
networks

613
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,160
so i expected to support all types

614
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,280
also in some improvements in

615
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,560
ecmp of redirect to ip action can be

616
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,079
achieved by encoding multiple redirect

617
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,280
extended

618
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,960
communities

619
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,240
the current

620
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
sites of

621
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,680
mechanisms can hardly support each

622
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,400
example of sry6 tunnels nor usamp of

623
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,040
other types

624
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,839
let's slide please

625
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,200
and to achieve this will propose

626
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,640
redirect load balancing global community

627
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,240
it is an exciting to prep community

628
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,160
container attribute

629
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,119
defined in the what vlp

630
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,040
communities draft

631
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,760
it allows traffic direction to a load

632
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,640
balancing group and suppose

633
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,200
both ccmp and the usmp scenarios

634
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,400
as the picture shows the general format

635
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,960
comply with bjp community container

636
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
attribute

637
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,760
for example the face of the type

638
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,480
flash reserved links

639
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,359
community value source es number and

640
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,440
contact as number

641
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
combined with the corresponding

642
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,119
definition

643
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
in bdp community container attribute

644
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
we define a new community value

645
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,960
representing the related load balancing

646
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,119
global community type

647
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,560
the value is to be defined

648
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,079
and subtype is three representing bdp

649
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,359
while committee parameter tra defunded

650
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,320
in what vlp community's draft

651
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,280
and the

652
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,000
uh answer

653
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,880
parameter must

654
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,839
present and show the appearance on ones

655
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:40,240
in a redirect load balancing global

656
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,079
community

657
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,119
parameter theory contains audit a list

658
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,800
of atoms

659
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,359
each liberations was massive for

660
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,480
radiation action

661
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,680
next slide please

662
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,920
atoms are encoded as theories which

663
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,280
comply with the community atom format

664
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,720
and we define some atom difference of

665
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
atoms for mass the figure is one over

666
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
four mass

667
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,440
its ipoh6 preface with color and weight

668
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,599
indicating the derivation path is

669
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,920
weighted and to a srv6 tunnel

670
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,880
it contains the phase of the type

671
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,200
lens flag accuracy

672
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,000
color and weight

673
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,520
the type is used exclusively with the

674
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,320
redirect load balancing global community

675
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,880
and the type of value is 8

676
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,400
the length is phase for each atom

677
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,680
the flag is the two actors reserved for

678
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,680
filter use must be set to zero

679
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,200
the ip video is ip video address

680
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,359
or asa 610 and pawn for redirection the

681
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,480
car is srv6 channel color for

682
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,839
redirection

683
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,359
the weight is the load balancing weight

684
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,720
on next slide please

685
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,079
and currently we have introduced eight

686
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,680
types actions

687
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,000
for both ipv4 and ipv6 nest

688
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,599
coverall profits only price with weight

689
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,960
price phase and color profits and color

690
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
with weight

691
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,040
in pre-simple sub-theories may be

692
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,119
combined in any mode

693
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,480
the supported combinations depend on the

694
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
specific implementations

695
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,800
the redirect global community contains

696
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,280
more than one atoms

697
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
if not

698
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,079
all atoms are of a weighted type these

699
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,640
atoms will form a ecmp group if all

700
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,200
atoms are of a weighted type

701
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,040
these atoms will form a usmp group

702
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,800
in this case the

703
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,079
weight field value of these atoms should

704
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,680
be ignored

705
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,760
and the values are used

706
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
as

707
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,319
the ratio of the usmp group

708
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,759
and let's try please

709
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,720
welcome more comments and discard

710
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,200
thank you

711
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,040
jeff you have the mic

712
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,160
thank you for your presentation

713
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,480
uh a couple of things

714
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,520
first thing

715
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
we will ask the authors for white

716
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,160
communities to review your extensions

717
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
for the atoms and

718
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,520
offer some advice

719
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,839
as an example it's unclear whether we

720
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,920
need a new atom for color

721
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,160
uh an integer could work in that spot as

722
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,359
an example

723
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,920
but that's a small detail

724
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,760
the second item i would ask you to

725
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,560
consider in your draft is as flow spec

726
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
v2 begins its work and is starting to

727
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,760
look at how to do load balancing and

728
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,359
potentially

729
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,720
interactions of different actions

730
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,960
we need to figure out

731
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,160
how this feature is intended to behave

732
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,599
if you have more than one type of

733
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,520
redirect community present

734
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,680
it may just simply be an error case

735
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,960
it would be good if you discussed that

736
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,599
in your document

737
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,839
thank you

738
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,280
super thanks sue you have the mic

739
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,079
can you hear me

740
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,880
okay yes yes let's go ahead okay well

741
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,960
would you go back one slider here would

742
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,280
you go back one slide

743
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,240
two slides i think

744
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
one thing i didn't understand in your

745
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,000
discussion

746
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,079
um

747
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,440
is

748
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
um

749
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,319
what please go one more slide down here

750
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,359
i'll see if i can help

751
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,400
this one okay

752
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,560
um no but i'll just uh

753
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,119
number five please

754
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,839
that'll help you

755
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,520
the question is

756
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
you had a discussion for waiting on

757
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,280
these it would be good to discuss

758
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
not only if you can handle one as jeff

759
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,480
said or one other there are other ones

760
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,359
and then i didn't quite i'd like you to

761
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,240
improve the text on reading and i think

762
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,319
i'll just leave it at that

763
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,119
uh

764
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,319
karen you can go on well we can i'm glad

765
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,119
to chat with you offline on this one

766
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,280
uh jeff is correct on the white

767
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
communities

768
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
i have questions specifically on how

769
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
you're waiting this compared to other

770
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,000
things

771
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,960
in the v2 spec so we'll go from there

772
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,280
later

773
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,319
super thank you so much wolf okay thank

774
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,119
you thank you

775
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,920
hi

776
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,160
thank you

777
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,640
all right g you're next

778
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,200
okay can you help me

779
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
yes i can

780
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,040
okay hello everyone this is jaden from

781
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,000
huawei

782
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,480
i'm going to give an update about this

783
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,119
draft called bgprs extensions for the

784
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,880
scalable sr based enhanced vpn

785
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,160
okay next page please

786
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,640
first some background about this work

787
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,720
we have the vp framework in the test

788
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,440
working group which is

789
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,520
described the framework for the enhanced

790
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,839
vaping services and one of the typical

791
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:29,040
use case

792
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,359
is to deliver the itf network slide

793
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,800
service

794
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,640
and item narrative slice framework is

795
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,359
also describing this

796
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:40,000
and that document introduced a concept

797
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,200
called

798
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,880
natural resource partition for the

799
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
natural slice realization

800
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,680
and in the context of of network slicing

801
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,560
narpy is considered as an instant

802
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,440
instantiation of the vp vtn defined in

803
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,160
the vpn plus framework

804
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,280
and

805
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,359
considering the scalability of the nrp

806
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,839
is important we have another draft in

807
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,839
the test working group which is working

808
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,880
on the

809
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,960
analysis and the optimization

810
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,240
considerations of the scalability of nrp

811
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,000
in both the control plane and the data

812
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:12,960
plane

813
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
it also provides some guidelines for the

814
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,960
protocol extensions

815
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,760
and for the igp extensions to provide a

816
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,560
scalable sr-based vaping plus service

817
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,839
there's a draft in the rsr working group

818
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,960
so here uh in the idr we would like to

819
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,839
introduce the bgp rs extensions to for

820
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,200
the scalable sr based vpn plus

821
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,079
this document introduced mechanisms to

822
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,000
distribute the intro domain and the

823
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,880
inter domain nrp topology and resource

824
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,839
attributes to the network

825
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,799
controller okay next page

826
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,560
yeah here we would like to give an

827
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
overview of the related documents in

828
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,800
several working groups as i just

829
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,920
mentioned

830
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,920
the framework documents are in this

831
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
working group which includes the itm

832
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,359
network slides

833
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,440
document it is working on the concept

834
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
and the general framework and the

835
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,200
vpnplus framework

836
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,400
provides a

837
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
mechanism which can be used for the

838
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,280
slice realization the nrp scalability

839
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
considerations is also in the test

840
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,800
working group

841
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,599
and for the data plane there are several

842
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,640
data plane capsulations mechanisms

843
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,079
to carry the

844
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,760
rpo

845
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,160
specific information the first approach

846
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,119
is described in the spring working group

847
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,240
based on the resource aware segments

848
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,520
and in the ipv6 based encapsulation

849
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,680
there's another draft based using the

850
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,000
ipv6 hardware hub extension headers to

851
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,280
carry the vtn id or we can call it uh an

852
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,200
rpid maybe

853
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,960
there's also another drafting mpls

854
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,800
working group to provide a similar

855
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
functionality

856
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,119
for the control plane we have several

857
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,160
set of drafts and for the control plane

858
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,760
and to distribute the vtn rp information

859
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,839
both in the network domains and to the

860
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,440
network controllers

861
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,240
uh

862
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,880
and this document is just one of this

863
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
set and it provides a scalable between

864
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,560
nrp information distribution

865
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,800
we also have the drafts

866
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,359
working on the nrp of 18 specific pass

867
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:24,079
computation and instantiation based on

868
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,640
sr bgpsr policy or psat protocol

869
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,119
then in the management plane there's uh

870
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,520
young data models and to provide another

871
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,040
slide service

872
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,319
model to the network size customers and

873
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,960
also an rpm model for the installation

874
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,240
of the nrp in the network

875
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,118
okay next page

876
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,760
so

877
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,559
some information about the optimization

878
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,200
introduced in this document the first is

879
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,599
uh to improve the scalability

880
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,480
uh

881
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,920
the

882
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,839
the practical mechanism is to map

883
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,720
multiple overlay connectivity services

884
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,720
to one shared vision of nrp

885
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,119
so that nrp provides the underlying

886
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,359
network topology and the resources

887
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,559
required by a group of the services

888
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,559
and the second approach is that we can

889
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,119
decouple the resource attribute of the

890
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,000
narpy so that multiple vietnamese can

891
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,319
share the same topology and also they

892
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,559
can share the topologies but specific

893
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,640
route computation

894
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,800
uh we can also allow multiple nrps to

895
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,960
share the same set of resources on some

896
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,800
of the network segments to allow

897
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,920
flexible resource isolation or sharing

898
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,240
based on the requirements

899
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,920
the last point is

900
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,400
to introduce a network-wide

901
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,880
data plane identifier in the packet so

902
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,280
that we can avoid to introduce

903
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,400
additional

904
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
uh per nrp

905
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,319
src's or srv6 locators in the network

906
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,040
so we will talk about the pgprs

907
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,440
extension will achieve these

908
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,480
optimizations in the following slides

909
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,599
okay next page please

910
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,040
so here is the first extension we

911
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,240
introduced the nrp definition sub dre

912
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
in the

913
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,599
pg uh maybe recorded trv in the bgp rs

914
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,599
attribute which is associated with the

915
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,119
node nri

916
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,160
it is used to advertise the relationship

917
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,640
between the nrp and the associated

918
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,800
topology and algorithms and other

919
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,240
attributes

920
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,520
here this

921
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,960
trva contains a 32-bit network

922
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,200
identifier of the nrp

923
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,480
and there's a mtid field to carry the

924
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,599
topology id associated with an rp

925
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:53,440
and another 8-bit algorithm id field

926
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,440
which can be either a normal algorithm

927
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,000
or the flexible algorithm

928
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,480
it also introduces a sub-sub-trvs for

929
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,960
the future extension for optional

930
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,000
attributes associated with nrp

931
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,880
okay

932
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,200
next slide

933
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,520
the second extension is to introduce an

934
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,000
rpid subtle

935
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,640
which is used to describe the list of an

936
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,200
rps that link belongs to and this can be

937
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,599
carried in the bgprs attribute which is

938
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,880
associated with a link nri

939
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,040
it can be used for both the intro domain

940
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,640
links and also the internal links

941
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,359
so the format of the tre is shown here

942
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,079
it basically contains a list of the nrp

943
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,640
ids and the flag field and the result

944
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,960
field

945
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,119
it also can be used as a subtree for the

946
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,599
layer to bundle member attribute tlv we

947
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,359
will talk about this

948
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,200
in the following slides

949
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,319
okay next page

950
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,960
the third the third extension introduced

951
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,119
is to

952
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,000
have a link attribute flags tlv

953
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,800
it is used to specify the attributes of

954
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,079
a link

955
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,079
and it can be carried in the bgprs

956
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,960
attribute associated with the link nri

957
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,200
or as a sub to v in the l to bundle

958
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,599
member attributes dlv

959
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,599
and the flat and the field

960
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,000
the format of this uh

961
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,680
htlv is consistent with the flag fields

962
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,839
defined in the isis link attribute sub

963
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,880
to

964
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,599
and here we introduce a new flag called

965
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,800
e flat

966
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,839
so it is used to indicate whether the

967
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,040
link is can be used for load balancing

968
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,480
across a bundle or the

969
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,319
group of links or it is can only be used

970
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,960
exclusively for the traffic associated

971
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,559
with a specific set of nrps

972
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,119
okay next page

973
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,680
so uh for the topology information

974
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
action distribution

975
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,880
um

976
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,760
here

977
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,359
for the intra domain topology

978
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,599
advertisement

979
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,000
we would reuse the existing

980
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
multitopology and flash algo based

981
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,040
mechanisms

982
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,960
and multiple uh nrps can associate with

983
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,440
the same topology algorithm tuple to

984
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,880
avoid the

985
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,720
duplicated topology information

986
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,800
distribution in the network

987
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,040
here the multi topology is used to

988
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,359
define the logical topology and the

989
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,160
topology link node attributes

990
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,319
and flash algo can be used to specify

991
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,960
magic type and the topological

992
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,480
constraints which apply to topology

993
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,880
and with the extension

994
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
for s-segment routing

995
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,280
we can also distribute the pro topology

996
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,960
algorithm srcs and srv6 locators using

997
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,680
bgp rs

998
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,240
okay next page

999
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,119
g are you still around i can hear you

1000
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,559
can you hear me

1001
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,880
yes i can hear you now okay uh so we are

1002
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,240
on this page into domain topology

1003
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,440
okay

1004
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,119
so for the introduced methodology

1005
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,440
information advertisement we will reuse

1006
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,000
the bgpr scpe to distribute the inner

1007
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,079
domain link connectivity and also the

1008
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,480
bjp pairing segments

1009
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,880
including the pure adjacency seed pure

1010
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,200
node seed and the pss

1011
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,480
and here

1012
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,760
we will also

1013
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,640
need to use the nrpids tlv

1014
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
in the bgprs attribute of the interdom

1015
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,680
link nri so that we can describe the

1016
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,160
list of analyze in our piece the

1017
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,599
interdomain link is associated with

1018
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,480
okay next slide please

1019
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,599
okay for the

1020
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,160
resource attribute advertisement

1021
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,640
for each nrp we have

1022
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,720
considered two options

1023
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,119
the first option is to use a auto bundle

1024
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,559
based approach so that we consider

1025
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,160
each partition of the link resource as a

1026
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,480
physical or virtual l2 bundle member

1027
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,960
link of the layers reading so that we

1028
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,280
can use the bgprs extensions for the

1029
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,760
auto bundle member links to advertise

1030
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,480
the bandwidth and other tea attributes

1031
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,040
of this

1032
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,520
partitioning resource partition

1033
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,400
and to associate this r2 member link

1034
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,599
with the nrps we also use the nrp id

1035
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:10,880
subtlv

1036
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,280
with this pgprs auto bundle member

1037
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,599
attribute tlv

1038
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,640
here we also use the to

1039
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,640
link ashby flags

1040
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,440
uh as an e-flag defined in this document

1041
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,599
in to indicate whether this bundle

1042
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,359
member link can be used for load

1043
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:30,160
balancing or it is exclusively

1044
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,720
for the nrp's usage

1045
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,359
and for the t attributes uh

1046
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:37,359
information like the bandwidth and other

1047
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,520
t attributes of the autobundle member

1048
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,040
link this can be

1049
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,200
advertised by reusing the existing t

1050
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,079
attributes of the bgprs

1051
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,839
okay next page thanks

1052
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,400
and the second option is we can

1053
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,799
use the nrp link t attributes to

1054
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,680
advertise the different partition of the

1055
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,880
resources are allocated to the different

1056
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,720
rps on the link

1057
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,760
so that this upper energy specific t

1058
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,920
attribute rv is defined

1059
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,960
which contains a list of the nrp ids and

1060
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,119
the list of the t attributes which are

1061
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,960
shared by the

1062
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,920
set of the narratives on this specific

1063
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
link

1064
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,040
okay next slide please

1065
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,520
okay this uh

1066
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,680
in in addition to the advertisement of

1067
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,599
the topology and the resource attribute

1068
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,760
we also need to advertise

1069
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,960
the nrp specific uh data plan ids so

1070
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,319
that we can generate the forwarding

1071
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
entries for different nrps

1072
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,720
here are also two options the first one

1073
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,319
is we can use per nrp src's or srv6

1074
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,960
locators and it's

1075
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,680
falling this way we need to add a set of

1076
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,240
new tlv or sub trvs for the

1077
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,000
advertisement of the

1078
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,680
nrp specific

1079
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,640
amperage seed or nabi specific services

1080
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,040
locators and seeds

1081
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,119
the second option is we use the

1082
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,200
mechanism optimization mechanism

1083
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,960
mentioned in the beginning we use

1084
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,839
dedicated nrp ids in the data plane so

1085
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:18,480
that we can use the same id

1086
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,160
in the data plane as the one in the

1087
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,680
control plane

1088
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,480
this this way we don't need to advertise

1089
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,559
additional nrp specific

1090
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,559
ids for the data plane

1091
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,079
and this can

1092
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,520
save the

1093
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,240
problem and resources for the additional

1094
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,400
id distribution

1095
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,559
and in this mechanism need to introduce

1096
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,599
the new encapsulations in the packet and

1097
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,760
the encapsulations for ipv6 and mpls uh

1098
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,480
described in the separate drafts in the

1099
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,000
t as ib

1100
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,599
six-man and the ampere smoking group

1101
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,640
okay next slide

1102
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,680
okay so

1103
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,000
for this document we would like to hear

1104
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
comments and feedbacks about this

1105
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,440
approaches and the options described

1106
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,680
so that we can refine the document in

1107
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,559
next

1108
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,079
revision

1109
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,599
and by the way we would like to mention

1110
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,599
that we are working on the terminology

1111
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:17,920
alignment with the test documents and

1112
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,880
other

1113
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,119
igp extension drafts

1114
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,920
like the fbt and rp we will align them

1115
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,760
in the next version

1116
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,160
thank you

1117
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,119
comments

1118
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,000
thank you g

1119
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,960
okay thank you thank you

1120
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,760
next uh we have is uh giuseppe uh for

1121
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,359
who's going to talk about sr policy

1122
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:15,760
extensions for ife giuseppe can you hear

1123
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,480
me hello everybody can you hear me

1124
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,280
yep

1125
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,799
please go ahead

1126
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:23,520
yeah this is an update about the

1127
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,880
bgpsr police extension for ifit so next

1128
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,880
slide

1129
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,079
yeah just a quick background so

1130
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,200
i fit denoted all the on path

1131
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,599
uh telemetry technique so in particular

1132
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,119
in c2im and alternate marking

1133
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,280
we all know that and then can be

1134
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,400
informed about the candidate part

1135
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,839
for nsr policy by using bgp and there is

1136
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:57,200
a well advanced document on that so

1137
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,400
this

1138
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,839
draft simply extend

1139
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:04,240
this document and extend bgp to

1140
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,280
distribute as a policy carrying also the

1141
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,599
ifit information in this way

1142
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,559
uh iom and alternate marking can be

1143
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,960
enabled that automatically when the sf

1144
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,119
policy is activated

1145
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,760
next slide

1146
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,079
yeah this is basically

1147
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,599
the

1148
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,200
extension so

1149
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,760
how the i feed attributes are

1150
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,890
included in the bgp

1151
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,680
[Music]

1152
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,559
as a bgp extension so at

1153
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,280
candidate part level dfi attributes are

1154
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,640
attached as some tlvs

1155
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,040
since the sr policy candidate part is

1156
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,960
encoded in the tunnel encapsulation

1157
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,480
attribute it is

1158
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,359
simply it simply extends

1159
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,280
the

1160
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,319
the attributes defined in the itf idr

1161
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:03,280
segment routing t policy graph

1162
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,720
so as i said there are five sub tlvs

1163
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,000
currently defined four four in c2im and

1164
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,799
one for alternate market

1165
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,799
uh next slide

1166
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,680
next slide i guess there are the details

1167
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,000
of the sub tlds

1168
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,240
uh of course they are aligned with the

1169
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,440
relevant document for in c2im and

1170
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,480
alternate marking

1171
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,759
next slide

1172
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,799
yeah in this slide we just

1173
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:39,440
explain how this document complements

1174
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,880
the sr policy operation described in the

1175
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,280
segment routing t policy draft

1176
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,280
so the only addition uh is that

1177
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,760
after the event can be informed about

1178
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:55,440
multiple candidate parts via bgp or psf

1179
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,880
or preset additional information uh like

1180
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,200
ifeet are included at candidate part

1181
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,000
level and then the selection of the best

1182
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,880
candidate part can be done and

1183
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,440
selected and installed in the forwarding

1184
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,400
plane

1185
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,640
it may be possible for an implementation

1186
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,559
to choose the candidate path also

1187
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,400
considering the supported by hit

1188
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,039
attributes based on the local

1189
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:20,480
configuration

1190
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,599
and then the effect methods in c2im and

1191
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,599
or alternate marking can be enabled

1192
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,520
automatically

1193
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,240
next slide

1194
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,319
okay yeah we consider this document

1195
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,280
quite relevant to enable um in c2im and

1196
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,119
alternate marking for

1197
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,960
control mechanism

1198
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,280
as as also mentioned before this is a

1199
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,280
simple extension of

1200
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,160
of the current draft on segment routing

1201
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,559
t policy

1202
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,160
of course we welcome questions and

1203
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:53,760
comments on this

1204
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,160
thank you

1205
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:02,920
thank you so much any questions

1206
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,520
cool thank you

1207
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,240
okay thank you

1208
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,680
next on the presentation we have uh

1209
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,000
sid algorithm information in pgp

1210
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,880
uh by yao

1211
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,799
hi everyone

1212
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,520
this is a yao leo from zte

1213
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,119
and the presentation is about

1214
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:51,599
advertising set algorithm information

1215
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,799
bgp

1216
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:56,280
next slide please

1217
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,240
as introduced in the

1218
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,039
draft segment routine t policy eleven

1219
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,880
segment types

1220
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,240
uh segment sub trees uh from type a to

1221
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,240
type k are defined between code sisps or

1222
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,319
srv6 segments

1223
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,680
and sr algorithm can be optional that it

1224
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,000
can be optionally specified in

1225
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,319
segmented sub-trees for simplest prefix

1226
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,039
srv6 prefix and srv6 adjacency and this

1227
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:33,599
document defines some new segment sub

1228
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,000
tvs with algorithm

1229
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,839
to meet more requirements when

1230
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,119
delivering as a policy via pgp

1231
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,599
next slide

1232
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:52,960
one kind of new second sub tv is simples

1233
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,559
adjacency with optional algorithm

1234
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,160
and the draft idf lsr algorithm related

1235
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,440
adjacency complements that besides

1236
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,160
prefix it the algorithm can also be

1237
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,599
included as a part of an sim prs

1238
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,880
adjacency

1239
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,480
advertisement

1240
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,880
in scenarios where multiple algorithms

1241
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,200
share the same link resource

1242
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,880
so in this case

1243
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,240
an simples policy advertised to the

1244
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,960
haddad may also contain

1245
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,280
algorithm specific

1246
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,720
adjacency

1247
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,520
following are the four new segment sub

1248
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,720
theories

1249
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,880
the formats are similar

1250
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,039
as the existing type e f g and h

1251
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,119
except that there is an optional

1252
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,680
algorithm field with the

1253
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,319
next slide

1254
01:05:48,839 --> 01:05:52,400
um so i'm gonna escape the detailed

1255
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,280
structure of the new segment subject

1256
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,920
next piece

1257
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,520
and another new kind of

1258
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,680
segment sub theory is

1259
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,640
set only with optional algorithm

1260
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,960
carrying the algorithm information along

1261
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,200
with the seats can be used for

1262
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,920
verification purpose the header can

1263
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:18,720
check if the set value and the related

1264
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,839
algorithm

1265
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,520
received can

1266
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,599
whether

1267
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,480
whether it can be found in its srdb if

1268
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,240
request to do so

1269
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,640
and the header may also need

1270
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,680
to know about the city-related algorithm

1271
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,680
for troubleshooting and network

1272
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,359
management

1273
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,400
so type l and type n are defined

1274
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,680
separately in this draft for as i am plc

1275
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,559
set and as i said said

1276
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,440
the familiar uh the format of

1277
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,880
similar to type a and type b segment

1278
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,160
sub-tree

1279
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,000
except that there's an optional

1280
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,200
algorithm algorithm field

1281
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,839
next slide

1282
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,799
yeah that's all and we welcome feedbacks

1283
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:08,000
and comments thank you

1284
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,960
thank you so much

1285
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,079
caitanya you have a mic

1286
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,200
thanks for the present

1287
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,039
thanks for the presentation

1288
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:22,079
uh

1289
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,880
i think a couple of those uh

1290
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,200
seems valid or new uh

1291
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,119
where adjacency said was

1292
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,720
for adjacency said we introduced

1293
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,160
algorithms

1294
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,039
i'm not sure about other ones

1295
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,280
but in any case it would be good to get

1296
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,520
some review or feedback from spring

1297
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,440
working

1298
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,559
thank you

1299
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,000
oh sure thank you

1300
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,680
any other questions

1301
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,839
for y'all

1302
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,559
thank you so much yo

1303
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,079
okay

1304
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,920
next presentation we have is on bgps or

1305
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,640
policy extensions for metric uh

1306
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,199
this is kazan car you have a mic

1307
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:34,000
hello can you hear me

1308
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,238
yes

1309
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,880
okay thank you

1310
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,238
my topic is bgp as a policy extension

1311
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,238
for metric i'm cut down from huawei

1312
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,439
next slide please

1313
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:54,719
uh as a bdp can be used to propagate the

1314
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:56,960
extra policy candidate paths to the

1315
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,319
heart and nodes in the network and

1316
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:04,560
using bdp the as a policy as a f i can

1317
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:05,679
be

1318
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,198
encoded like this and

1319
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:10,399
with the

1320
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:12,799
with the k distinguished policy color

1321
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,359
and endpoint and each candidate path can

1322
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,319
have several segments list

1323
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,839
next slide please

1324
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,880
by using bgp as a policy

1325
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,198
controllers may deliver different asset

1326
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,080
policies which satisfy the constraints

1327
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,359
of vpns or bdp routers

1328
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,158
but sometimes the bp router of a pin

1329
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:40,158
router needs to choose the next hub

1330
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:43,759
according to the igp metric of each sr

1331
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,679
policy for example in this scenario

1332
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,719
on p1 the router prefix c2 has two

1333
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,040
different next half

1334
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,880
one next top is p3 the other next top is

1335
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,960
p4 and each next hop has

1336
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,760
one as a policy as a policy one as a

1337
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,199
policy tool

1338
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,480
both as a policies satisfy the delay and

1339
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,640
the bandwidth constraints

1340
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:14,400
and the magic

1341
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,520
the idp metric of active parts of as a

1342
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,000
policy wire which is the p1 to p p1 to

1343
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,600
p3

1344
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:28,400
the igp matrix is 20 and the

1345
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,199
whereas the igp matrix of the active

1346
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:33,760
path of sr policy 2

1347
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,159
which is p1 to p2 to p2 and 2

1348
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:42,880
p4 the igp matrix is 120

1349
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,760
in this case if p1 wants to choose the

1350
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,199
laptop according to the igp metric of i

1351
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:51,120
as a policies

1352
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,600
that's neither uh the i need to know the

1353
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,040
actual

1354
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,120
adp metric of the

1355
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,679
as a policy thus the controller should

1356
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,120
deliver the idp metric of sr policies

1357
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,400
using bdp as the policy protocol

1358
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,280
next slide please

1359
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,920
uh to solve this problem we propose to

1360
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:21,120
add the matric subtype of it to bgp as a

1361
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,159
policy protocol the matrix sub two way

1362
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,880
is added as a subject of segmentalist

1363
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,080
next slide please

1364
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,960
and the four the format of magic subtly

1365
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,760
is defined as as follows

1366
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,600
uh here the the type of magic is to be

1367
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,000
defined the length is sex

1368
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,120
and the magic type specifies

1369
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:56,080
the

1370
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,679
magic type

1371
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,880
now we can define the uh

1372
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,080
several several values for example igp

1373
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,520
magic t magic hop counts delay

1374
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,239
or loss losslytometric

1375
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,440
and the

1376
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:14,560
magical value is encoded in three

1377
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:18,400
inserted 32 bits ieee for a from

1378
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,120
floating point format

1379
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,320
next slide please

1380
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,760
and by using the uh the idp magic of as

1381
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,440
a policies

1382
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,120
the controller can deliver the

1383
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,840
the is metric of different uh as a

1384
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,760
policies and then on p1 because

1385
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,679
we can get two different types of

1386
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,040
policies and the idp magic is different

1387
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,360
thus p1 can choose the next hub

1388
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,719
according to idp metric and then

1389
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,320
the results the routing choosing result

1390
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,600
is

1391
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,280
next hope is p3

1392
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,080
next slide please

1393
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,000
when as a policy head and get as a

1394
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,840
policy second list with with magical how

1395
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,360
to process the metric is local policy

1396
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,480
for example the active candidate parts

1397
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,520
of essa policy may have several segment

1398
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,719
lists

1399
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,280
each sectionalists have different

1400
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,400
metrics

1401
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,199
it is recommended that the secondaries

1402
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:34,239
in one candidate pass have the same

1403
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,159
magic type

1404
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:39,440
and if the magic values of segmentalists

1405
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,600
in one candidate pass are different the

1406
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,080
candidate path magic can use the minimum

1407
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,360
value as the magic of the candid path

1408
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,080
and the asset policy use the magic value

1409
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,080
of the active candidate paths

1410
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:56,880
the as a policymatic value then can be

1411
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,520
used in routine preference

1412
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,640
next started please

1413
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,520
and

1414
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,600
that's all welcome questions and

1415
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:13,560
comments thank you

1416
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,159
any questions for carl

1417
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,000
luke please go ahead yeah mike

1418
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,679
what's the consideration about

1419
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,520
the internal injury

1420
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,840
while your extra policy

1421
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,600
is across multiple igp demands because

1422
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,760
your expansion is about

1423
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:44,000
igp magic

1424
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,520
what's the entertainment menu

1425
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,560
okay

1426
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,920
different

1427
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,199
because

1428
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,560
the different as a policy path may may

1429
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,320
also satisfy the the my the delay or

1430
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,679
bandwidth

1431
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,560
of the application and

1432
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,440
so

1433
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,400
the application may want to idp magic to

1434
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,480
choose a different hub

1435
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:16,000
thus we need to know the the idp metric

1436
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,199
of the

1437
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,639
parts of sr policies

1438
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,800
so

1439
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,880
if the sr policy is across

1440
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,159
multiple igp domains

1441
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:33,199
is this scenario out of scope or have

1442
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:36,320
other considerations

1443
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,560
okay

1444
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,280
then then uh

1445
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,360
the controller may

1446
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,159
may control different areas of igp then

1447
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:50,480
the controller can know the

1448
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,480
idp matrix of all the whole paths so the

1449
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,199
controller can download the idp magical

1450
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:58,320
to the

1451
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,880
device

1452
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,080
okay let's take it to the list thank you

1453
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,120
thank you

1454
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,640
actually i got a question for you um

1455
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,640
you have defined

1456
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,480
different matrix

1457
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,040
do you also have to define another

1458
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,159
matrix type for aigp or aigp is not

1459
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,040
applicable here

1460
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,159
okay

1461
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,679
maybe

1462
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,280
we can add

1463
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,000
add it to the metric tab the magnet have

1464
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,960
can be extended

1465
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,520
okay super super you may want to

1466
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,239
consider that

1467
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,320
yeah yeah okay

1468
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,880
thank you

1469
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,920
thank you very much

1470
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,480
the next presentation we have is bgp for

1471
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,640
beer de path um this is going to be

1472
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,800
presented by

1473
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,480
haimo yes

1474
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,480
please go ahead

1475
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,800
hello everyone today i'm going to talk

1476
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,480
about the pgpe or bate pass

1477
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,799
next page

1478
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,719
so i would like to thank uh jeffrey john

1479
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:35,840
susan

1480
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,560
and tony p for their valuable comments

1481
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,719
and suggestions

1482
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:42,400
so according to their suggestions we

1483
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,880
made some updates these updates to the

1484
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,199
previous version include

1485
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:51,120
selecting partner type for blt pass on

1486
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:54,480
the tunnel in cap attribute

1487
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:55,679
and make

1488
01:17:55,679 --> 01:18:00,239
making some editorial changes next page

1489
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,760
on the terminal

1490
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,040
in-cap attribute type 23

1491
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,560
we define

1492
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,360

1493
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,000

01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,719
this tlv

1495

bfr id

1519
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:11,520
of the inquiries of the

1520
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,840
bate path

1521
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,679
and the tunnel id

1522
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,520
and the pass number

1523
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,840
next page

1524
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,600
so i think that after

1525
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,719
the updates the draft is uh

1526
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,320
clear and simple and uh uh we but we

1527
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,920
will still

1528
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,400
welcome comments and i would like to

1529
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,440
request for adoption

1530
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:13,800
are we taking questions comments

1531
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,000
can they still hear us

1532
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,120
why don't you go ahead

1533
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,360
okay jeffrey drum from juniper

1534
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,159
um we probably don't need to call it as

1535
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:39,199
beer tea just call it beer then whether

1536
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:41,440
it's a beer tea or not it does not

1537
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:44,960
really matter probably just call it beer

1538
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,400
yeah that's okay that's okay yeah

1539
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,960
there's no problem for me

1540
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,360
thank you

1541
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,280
all right

1542
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,759
so you're next

1543
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,040
just so you know

1544
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,639
your draft is in

1545
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:11,920
the queue for adoption i have a favor to

1546
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,400
ask do you think you could

1547
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,880
um ask the

1548
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:19,679
bigger chairs to summarize

1549
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:22,400
uh their work in this area and send it

1550
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,560
to us or shall i do that

1551
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,920
it's it's good i think it's part of the

1552
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,880
pre-adoption cycle we need to

1553
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,840
have an understanding of

1554
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,320
uh is this conflict

1555
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,639
uh is this something that the beer

1556
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,320
working group is

1557
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,560
thought of worked on is it something i

1558
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,560
think we should pick up

1559
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,960
that would be helpful did you do that a

1560
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,920
couple

1561
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,920
sessions ago and i'm forgetting it

1562
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:55,760
oh you mean uh request request a child

1563
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,560
of a beer to have a summary of this one

1564
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,440
how this

1565
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:05,600
how this fits in the rest of the bear

1566
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,920
group we can send it to the chairs and i

1567
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,280
can re

1568
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,360
focus if he doesn't want to send it

1569
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,679
directly to the idr group but one of the

1570
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:14,960
questions

1571
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:17,840
is how does this fit in the rest of the

1572
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,440
architecture

1573
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,000
the architecture document i thought it'd

1574
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,280
fit in

1575
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,800
i'd like

1576
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,440
to make sure that we

1577
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:29,040
check with the beer

1578
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,440
chairs and the beer working group to

1579
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,880
make sure

1580
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,280
we're aligned on this does that request

1581
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,440
make sense if not i can take that

1582
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,360
offline with you we will

1583
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,600
maybe take offline to we can discuss in

1584
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,719
details and uh about the water

1585
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,880
and then what the details and then to

1586
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,880
what the extent of the detail

1587
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,960
i can summarize yes yep

1588
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,440
the whole idea is to have the idea folks

1589
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,360
before we do the adoption cult because

1590
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,120
it's coming up

1591
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,719
um

1592
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,639
probably after the

1593
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,679
the bgp um

1594
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:06,400
autocomp from the car dt one it'll

1595
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,400
probably be one of the ones that comes

1596
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:10,560
immediately after so we have a little

1597
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,719
bit of time i'd like to make sure the

1598
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:15,199
working group has the context

1599
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,199
with a message

1600
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,080
that goes along with the call so i just

1601
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,239
need to have your help there

1602
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,600
thank you very much

1603
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,920
no problem okay thank you

1604
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,800
thank you can you hear me now

1605
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,080
yes

1606
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,239
super

1607
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,400
i'd lost the connectivity

1608
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,080
uh

1609
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,960
next on the list to present

1610
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,280
is

1611
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:44,960
link bandwidth extended community by

1612
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,960
weiyen

1613
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,559
can you see the presentation

1614
01:23:56,719 --> 01:24:00,560
yes we can yes we can super thanks

1615
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,360
when you're dead

1616
01:24:04,159 --> 01:24:07,199
uh yes

1617
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,080
hello we can't hear you

1618
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,000
you're probably talking to a mute mike

1619
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,639
we can actually actually hit his

1620
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:20,719
um um

1621
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,400
well his face his face or his icon

1622
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:28,440
that means he's sending audio

1623
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,239
the audio is coming out very choppy at

1624
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,718
my end

1625
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,000
let's give him a minute

1626
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
if it doesn't recover we can go to the

1627
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,239
next presentation

1628
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,080
oh can you hear me

1629
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,760
yes much better

1630
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,480
please go oh

1631
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,520
my topic is the intentional income and

1632
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,239
wise you could send the community

1633
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:29,599
this is the update for previous version

1634
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:33,280
another page please

1635
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,960
a review reviews of the

1636
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,199
one and two issues

1637
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,600
the too many uni units

1638
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:43,199
defendations

1639
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:46,639
we are away in this version we remove

1640
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:49,520
with the more unique definitions using

1641
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,400
the original units

1642
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,480
bytes per second

1643
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,360
second

1644
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,639
a suggestion for a sacramento floating

1645
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:01,920
point typo we learned you about the

1646
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:05,520
diacomo of lotium point typo and

1647
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:10,719
font is that user was very complicated

1648
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,679
briefly

1649
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,719
hello

1650
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:17,600
is

1651
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,840
here

1652
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,080
yes we can hear you please continue

1653
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:25,600
okay okay okay

1654
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,199
i'll continue briefly the uh diagonal

1655
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:32,000
diagonal floating type of previous two

1656
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
accordion uh

1657
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,199
schemes

1658
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:38,719
a tacoma coding a scheme and a binary

1659
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,679
coding scheme those two coding scheme

1660
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:43,280
can be

1661
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:46,560
said to be a complete difference besides

1662
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,560
the coding of the

1663
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,520
complement part is also difficult to

1664
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:53,679
understand

1665
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:55,040
certainly

1666
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,199
may use

1667
01:26:57,199 --> 01:26:59,040
cst for

1668
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:03,199
these unsend integers in ginger we think

1669
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:06,239
this is a feasible direction

1670
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,519
and that's the picture please

1671
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,800
at the same time we also consider

1672
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,679
consider many extension methods based on

1673
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,960
the extended community attributes

1674
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,840
first

1675
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,960
new accordions came the same unit as the

1676
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:26,239
same unit

1677
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:29,440
uses the unsending changes in batch

1678
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:32,880
force seconds the bandwidth value origin

1679
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,719
is the limits

1680
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:35,840
this is

1681
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,560
the problem and the second

1682
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:41,360
the new coordinates came on new units a

1683
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,560
year

1684
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:45,199
megabits per second

1685
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:48,800
this this also has a problem that is the

1686
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:52,159
bandwidth value or the funnel with value

1687
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:53,679
above can be

1688
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,239
fixed but the prices was lost

1689
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:01,600
next page please

1690
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:04,239
so we extend the

1691
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:06,880
link up another based on the

1692
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:10,560
64 bits a new type of

1693
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,080
ipv new

1694
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:12,840
6

1695
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,639
ipv6

1696
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:17,280
addresses pacifico you attended the

1697
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,840
community's attributes that is

1698
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,760
considered to

1699
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,360
represent

1700
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:26,880
in 64-bit selling abundance

1701
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,040
as shown in the future

1702
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,960
uh the typos

1703
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:33,360
the type of

1704
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,560
three or

1705
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,400
of uh fourth three are the the commanded

1706
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,840
refers to

1707
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,960
rfc

1708
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,840
four three six zero sub type is tvd

1709
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,400
that's the pitch

1710
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:52,400
thank you more coming

1711
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,400
companies and discussion is welcome and

1712
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:01,280
another ideas is also in is in

1713
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,719
will come

1714
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,120
thank you

1715
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:08,800
thank you so much any questions for

1716
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,800
albanian

1717
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:25,639
cool thank you

1718
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:37,040
um

1719
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:39,679
the next presentation we have

1720
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:41,360
is about

1721
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:45,040
pgp metric credit from

1722
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,519
shuffle

1723
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:50,840
hi

1724
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:53,679
hello yes we can hear you please go

1725
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,440
ahead

1726
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,360
okay thank you

1727
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,040
uh thank you

1728
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,520
now i will introduce

1729
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,600
pgp measure collected past attributes

1730
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,800
so

1731
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:09,360
next uh

1732
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,600
excuse me uh

1733
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,639
how to

1734
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:15,679
turn the next page

1735
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,480
oh thanks so uh the motivations here is

1736
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,840
that the dystopia is related with

1737
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,000
pgp and tenderlode

1738
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,320
uh as i know uh

1739
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,840
now the calendar pgp

1740
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,960
intended scheme are discussed in idea wg

1741
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:42,400
pgp intended loads includes not only the

1742
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,880
load with minimum delay

1743
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:46,320
but also

1744
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,960
with specific cumulative delay for

1745
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,120
example 100 milliseconds

1746
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:56,639
so a single nintendo template configured

1747
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:59,199
under intermediate bgb speaker

1748
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,679
may be used for multiple paths

1749
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:06,000
designated to different endpoints

1750
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,560
that means that

1751
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,120
we can not

1752
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,239
rely

1753
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:16,960
on the configuration and ucb speaker to

1754
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,320
use

1755
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,760
different

1756
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,120
low solution

1757
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,800
data requirements so

1758
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,120
uh this information

1759
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:27,199
is better to color

1760
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,960
in the

1761
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,440
what has the

1762
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,120
nose

1763
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,920
next please

1764
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,520
so these are typical signals for

1765
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,560
example

1766
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,280
we can see the figure eight

1767
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:49,040
volume of the head and the total and the

1768
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,960
point

1769
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,080
the

1770
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,719
intended load with delay 100

1771
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,080
milliseconds

1772
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:58,480
there may be multiples

1773
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:01,599
but for each pass

1774
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:03,199
the segments

1775
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,199
may have different requirements for

1776
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:06,800
example in figure eight

1777
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,679
the segment form can end

1778
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:14,560
from age to b1 is 16 milliseconds but

1779
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,880
the from h2 b2

1780
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,080
maybe

1781
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,560
40 milliseconds

1782
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,000
that may be caused by

1783
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,239
the set of domain is

1784
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:28,718
different

1785
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,480
now we can see

1786
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,120
the fake b

1787
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,239
there is a similar for example the

1788
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,320
first part

1789
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,280
is averaged about 50

1790
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,840
milliseconds for each segment but for

1791
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,760
the past 4 it's

1792
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,679
33 milliseconds per easy second

1793
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:50,560
place

1794
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,560
next

1795
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,639
okay

1796
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,719
that is another two

1797
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:11,199
scenarios we can look at the figure c

1798
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:14,239
uh there are two intended laws uh

1799
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:17,360
just lead to different endpoints e1 and

1800
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:21,199
e2 but the intent identifies the

1801
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,839
same

1802
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,800
the the first thing conclude

1803
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:29,280
with the delay 100

1804
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,800
100 milliseconds but the second is 200

1805
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,920
milliseconds

1806
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,800
so how does node b determine the

1807
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:39,600
different delay requirements for segment

1808
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,280
volume b to

1809
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:46,080
e1 and volume b to e2 respectively

1810
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,320
and how does the av determine the

1811
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:50,560
differential requirements for the common

1812
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,360
segment from the age to be

1813
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:54,960
for these two

1814
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,360
intended loads

1815
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:58,080
so

1816
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,000
for the figure d

1817
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,199
for this example uh there's also two ten

1818
01:34:03,199 --> 01:34:04,400
dollars

1819
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,600
uh

1820
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,400
that designated two

1821
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,360
different endpoints with the same

1822
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,960
identify

1823
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,120
but both with the

1824
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,040
100 milliseconds

1825
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,440
so the question

1826
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,520
is similar

1827
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,920
next please

1828
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:36,880
so at the current phase we just provide

1829
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:37,840
the

1830
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,840
symbol schemes for

1831
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,800
for symbol case

1832
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,239
but this schema has

1833
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,800
problem is that is the intended routine

1834
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,840
is established between the no and the

1835
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,960
determined endpoints with a digital

1836
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,760
propagation path controlled by policy

1837
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,440
that is the past all the arbitrary

1838
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,239
from

1839
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,239
multiple propagation pathways were

1840
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,760
different obcoms

1841
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,080
we suggested

1842
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,600
using different intents all using the

1843
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,880
explicit

1844
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,560
propagation object

1845
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,000
list

1846
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,679
so

1847
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,840
the following metric correlated

1848
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,760
attribute information

1849
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,920
is just defined in the

1850
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:25,840
draft now

1851
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:29,440
the magical information is a targeted

1852
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:30,880
current

1853
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:31,920
for each

1854
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:33,040
current

1855
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,800
the total

1856
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,679
and the endometrial quality information

1857
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:40,719
and the estimated of counts

1858
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,199
and with the optional quality the piece

1859
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:45,839
information

1860
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,560
this information can be

1861
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:49,920
applied

1862
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,719
for the simple scenarios such as

1863
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,639
single pass

1864
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:57,360
for some communicated cases

1865
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,639
then maybe need uh the explicit

1866
01:36:00,639 --> 01:36:02,960
uh propagation object

1867
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,920
that uh uh to be defined in the next

1868
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,440
lesson

1869
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,159
so

1870
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:11,559
next please

1871
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:25,840
uh so

1872
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,679
based on the muscular quality

1873
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,080
information contained in the

1874
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,280
the

1875
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,400
attribute

1876
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,960
uh there's a cellular method to get the

1877
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,480
innovation for

1878
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,000
the solution

1879
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,360
uh assembler is you use an average

1880
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:46,239
inventory created that can be

1881
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:48,480
uh get

1882
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,920
to

1883
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:53,679
that total under under measurability

1884
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:55,520
divided by the estimated heat of

1885
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,960
accounts

1886
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,560
and 10

1887
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,400
uh good average

1888
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,160
metabolism with the

1889
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,840
[Music]

1890
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,400
relative

1891
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:09,840
magic together minimum warning

1892
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:12,920
and the second method is to use the

1893
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:14,960
exponential piece

1894
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,480
uh

1895
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,840
we can't get the from the collided piece

1896
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,280
along with

1897
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,040
index

1898
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,880
the intensity is just

1899
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,280
set by the calendar hope

1900
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:32,400
then we can get the

1901
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,360
minimum from the exponential

1902
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,600
piece and the

1903
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:40,239
positive one for resolution

1904
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,280
uh

1905
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,400
this the third method is using the

1906
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,880
epo and is the data user to be defined

1907
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,719
in the next version

1908
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,520
next please

1909
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,080
okay

1910
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,239
that is the percentage of this

1911
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,400
document any questions and comments i

1912
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,839
will come thank you

1913
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,960

1918
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:34,960
and my apologies but i believe we made

1919
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,239
it through the time

1920
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,400

anyone want to

1930
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,840
raise any questions about any of the

1931
01:39:10,840 --> 01:39:14,639
drafts get the last call

1932
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,040

quite tired

1940
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,080
you'll note that there's a number of

1941
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,080
threads that have been started on idr

1942
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:36,719
covering a wide variety of topics that

1943
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:39,360
have been raised during the sessions and

1944
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:41,600
you know the chairs like to urge you

1945
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,679
to go look for

1946
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,159
threads that are of interest to you and

1947
01:39:46,159 --> 01:39:47,679
also if you see something that was a

1948
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,920
question you had that has not been

1949
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,440
started as a thread

1950
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,199
please initiate one so that we can have

1951
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:55,119
good technical discussion

1952
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,519

1961
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:41,440
talk a little bit about what we learned

1962
